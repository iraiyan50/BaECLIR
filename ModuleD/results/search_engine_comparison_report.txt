SEARCH ENGINE COMPARISON REPORT
CLIR System vs Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We compared our CLIR system's results with three popular search engines:
• Google - World's leading search engine
• Bing - Microsoft's search engine
• DuckDuckGo - Privacy-focused search engine

For each query, we collected top 10 results from each engine
and analyzed overlap and differences.

KEY OBSERVATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Cross-lingual advantage: Our system retrieves results in BOTH
  Bangla and English, while Google often shows only one language

✓ Semantic matching: Our embeddings find semantically similar results
  beyond exact keyword matching

✓ Domain-specific: Optimized for Bangladesh news sources

✓ Named entity handling: Better cross-lingual entity matching
  (e.g., 'ঢাকা' ↔ 'Dhaka')
