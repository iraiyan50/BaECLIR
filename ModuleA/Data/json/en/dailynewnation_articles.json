Despite their control of the game, Barcelona struggled to break down Osasuna’s deep defensive block until the 70th minute when Pedri’s incisive pass cut through the visitors’ defense, finding Raphinha in his stride. The Brazilian forward took a controlled touch before unleashing a thunderous strike from the edge of the area, the ball arrowing inside the left post to finally break the deadlock.Raphinha sealed the win in the 86th minute. A deflected cross from Jules Kounde on the right found the Brazilian unmarked at the far post, and he calmly volleyed the ball into an empty net, giving the scoreline a more comfortable look.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/barca-overcome-resilient-osasuna", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 168},
{"title": "Thailand-Cambodia clashes reignite, killing soldier and civilians", "body": "Thailand launched air strikes Monday on its neighbour Cambodia, with both sides trading blame for renewed fighting on their disputed border that has killed four Cambodian civilians and a Thai soldier.Around 35,000 people in Thailand have been evacuated from border areas, the country’s Second Army Region said in a statement.Five days of combat between Thailand and Cambodia this summer killed 43 people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect.But last month Thailand paused a follow-on deal backed by US President Donald Trump to wind down hostilities, saying a landmine blast at the border had wounded several soldiers.Since then, Cambodian and Thai officials have reported sporadic skirmishes along their frontier, which reignited Sunday and Monday.Cambodia’s information minister Neth Pheaktra told AFP that “at least four Cambodian civilians were killed in the Thai attacks” on Monday, including a woman who died when a shell hit in Preah Vihear province. The three others were killed by shelling in Oddar Meanchey, and more than 10 civilians were wounded, Neth Pheaktra said.A Cambodian journalist was wounded by shrapnel from a Thai rocket in Oddar Meanchey, he added.The fresh fighting has sent thousands of civilians in both countries fleeing their homes.“The village head told us to evacuate, and given what happened in July, I complied immediately,” said farmer Pannarat Woratham who lives just a few kilometres from the border in Thailand’s Surin province and evacuated Sunday afternoon to a temple sheltering the displaced.It was the second time the 59-year-old had fled since late July when open combat was waged with fighter jets, missile strikes and ground troops, killing both civilians and soldiers.“Of course many of us thought the conflict was finally over. It shouldn’t have happened again like this,” Pannarat told AFP.Neth Pheaktra, the minister, told reporters at least 1,157 families had evacuated to safety in Oddar Meanchey alone.The conflict centres on a century-old disagreement over borders mapped during France’s colonial rule in the region, with both sides claiming a smattering of boundary temples.Both sides reported a brief skirmish on Sunday, which Thailand’s military had said left two soldiers wounded.But the fighting escalated early Monday morning.Thai army spokesman Winthai Suvaree told reporters on Monday that one soldier was killed and eight were wounded in attacks by Cambodian troops near the border.Thailand had launched air strikes against its neighbour in an act of self-defence, he said. “The Thai air power is being used only against Cambodian military targets, which allows damage to be contained and halts Cambodia’s supporting fire that caused Thai casualties,” Winthai said at a press conference.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/thailand-cambodia-clashes-reignite-killing-soldier-and-civilians", "date": "2025-12-09T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 430},

The Sindh Information Department said the upcoming film aims to present what it termed an accurate depiction of Lyari, contrasting with how the area was shown in Dhurandhar, which is set partly in Lyari between 1999 and 2009. The Indian film, released on December 5, depicts the area as being affected by gang violence, police operations, drug trafficking and militancy. Although Dhurandhar was not released in Pakistan, it has drawn attention there following its commercial success in India. The film was directed by Aditya Dhar and stars Ranveer Singh. In a post on X, the Sindh Information Department said Lyari represents “culture, peace and resilience” and rejected what it called attempts to portray the area through propaganda. It said Mera Lyari is scheduled for release in January 2026. Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, has historically been associated with gang-related violence, particularly during the early 2000s, a period depicted in Dhurandhar. The film includes characters based on real-life figures linked to criminal activity and law enforcement operations in the area. Officials said the new Pakistani film will focus on Lyari’s social and cultural identity.

Chelsea, who won 3-1 at Cardiff City on Tuesday, will face either Arsenal or Crystal Palace, who contest the last quarterfinal next Tuesday, in the other two-legged semifinal. Pep Guardiola made seven changes from the City side which won 3-0 at Crystal Palace on Sunday but the hosts had little trouble seeing off Brentford who offered very little going forward.After a slow start under relentless rain, City began to create opportunities, Rayan Cherki dragging a shot wide and having another attempt parried away while Oscar Bobb wasted a decent chance after weaving his way into the area. His tame effort was straight at the keeper and Bobb went off injured in the 19th minute to be replaced by Phil Foden, who himself made way near the end to allow 19-year-old Charlie Gray to come on and make his senior debut for City. Brentford’s Mathias Jensen forced City keeper James Trafford into a save with a free kick, the only time they really threatened in the first half and in the 32nd minute Cherki opened the scoring for the hosts. A City corner was headed away but the clearance fell outside the area to Cherki, who chested the ball down before shifting it on to his right foot and letting fly with an unstoppable shot into the far top corner. Cherki pulled out the Erling Haaland robot celebration, and then went to shake hands with the smiling City striker rested on the bench by Guardiola. City wrapped up the win in the 67th minute when Savinho took the ball into the area and his shot took a wicked deflection off Kristoffer Ajer which sent the ball looping over the keeper. Newcastle took the lead in the 10th minute when Fulham keeper Benjamin Lecomte pushed a low cross from Jacob Murphy into the path of Yoane Wissa, who marked his first start for the club by slotting home from close range. Fulham, who had started the brightest before going behind, were level six minutes later with the unmarked Sasa Lukic guiding a header into the corner of the net from Antonee Robinson’s cross.The home fans were celebrating going ahead in the 65th minute when Fulham’s Joachim Andersen turned the ball into his own net but the offside flag went up. Lecomte made an added-time save to deny Miley and when the game looked to be heading for a penalty shootout, Miley’s glanced header from the resulting corner sealed Newcastle’s place in the semifinal. “I thought I’d try to flick it on, and it luckily hit the back of the net and I’m buzzing,” Miley told Sky Sports.“We won it last season and hopefully we can do that again this year.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/man-city-reach-league-cup-semis", "date": "2025-12-19T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 488},

{"title": "Three ministries must unite for ‘One Health’ pledge: Adviser Farida", "body": "Effective implementation of the ‘One Health’ approach requires coordinated commitment at the highest level among the ministries of Health and Family Welfare, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and Fisheries and Livestock, Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter said on Wednesday. “One Health is not just a subject for speeches. It demands real commitment, policy-level decisions and a collective mindset to work together. The era of fragmented efforts is over; now we need a ‘whole-of-government’ and ‘whole-of-nation’ approach,” she said while chairing a seminar titled ‘One Health Activities: Opportunities, Challenges and Future Strategies’, organised by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock at a city hotel. The adviser said human health, animal health and the environment are deeply interconnected, and only through their integration can One Health be implemented in its true sense. She noted that while humans are victims of diseases, they are often also responsible for their spread. Unsafe food, environmental pollution, excessive use of antibiotics and unplanned urbanisation are increasing health risks, which must be addressed by prioritising preventive and primary healthcare. Farida Akhter said climate change, genetic diseases, food security and public health issues are closely linked. In this context, a decision has been taken to implement the proposed One Health initiative through a single DPP involving all three ministries, with three project directors to ensure active participation from each sector. Expressing optimism, she said Bangladesh would successfully implement the One Health initiative by considering human health, livestock, fisheries and the environment together, setting an effective example for others. Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said development planning must place environment, biodiversity and public health at its core, stressing the need for integrated and forward-looking decisions. She said while roads or infrastructure can be built, natural assets such as the Sundarbans or rivers cannot be recreated once destroyed. Climate change, pandemics and environmental crises repeatedly remind us that every element of nature is deeply interconnected, and humans are not owners of nature but an inseparable part of it. The environment adviser also pointed out that procedural complexities, weak inter-ministerial coordination and delays in decision-making are major obstacles to implementing One Health activities. To overcome these challenges, she stressed the need for effective advisory committees at national and district levels, along with clearly defined focal points in each ministry. Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser on Health and Family Welfare Prof Dr Md Sayedur Rahman said human health must remain at the centre of the One Health concept. He said the importance of fish, livestock and environmental health ultimately lies in their impact on human health, food security and livelihoods, as food contamination, unsafe animal feed and environmental changes eventually affect people. Describing the proposed One Health project as an ‘eye-opening’ initiative for Bangladesh, the special assistant said its goal is to build the capacity to detect health risks early and respond in a timely manner by viewing humans, animals and nature through a single lens.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/three-ministries-must-unite-for-one-health-pledge-adviser-farida", "date": "2025-12-17T21:03:36+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 486},
{"title": "Blast in Gaza injures Israeli soldier amid ceasefire tensions", "body": "An explosion in Gaza on Wednesday injured an Israeli soldier, prompting Israel to accuse Hamas of violating the US-brokered ceasefire and raising fresh concerns over the fragile truce in place since Oct 10. Israel’s military said the blast went off beneath a military vehicle as troops were dismantling militant infrastructure in the southern city of Rafah. The soldier sustained light injuries and was taken to hospital. Hamas rejected responsibility, saying the explosion was caused by unexploded ordnance left behind from earlier fighting and that mediators had been informed. Israel’s military dismissed the claim. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the incident as a ceasefire breach and said Israel would respond. The incident occurred as Hamas leaders met Turkish officials in Ankara to discuss moving to the second phase of the ceasefire, which has slowed despite largely holding. The next stage is expected to tackle sensitive issues, including further Israeli troop withdrawals, the future governance of Gaza, the deployment of an international stabilization force and the disarmament of Hamas. Since the truce began, all but one of the hostages taken in the Hamas-led Oct 7, 2023 attack have been released, alive or dead, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The family of the last hostage whose remains are still in Gaza urged that they be returned before talks advance. Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of ceasefire violations. Israel has previously carried out strikes following alleged attacks, while Hamas says Israel has restricted aid flows and continued strikes. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the truce began. Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met a Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Haya, reaffirming Ankara’s support for Palestinian rights and humanitarian efforts in Gaza. Hamas officials said Israel’s actions were obstructing progress toward the next phase of the agreement. On the hostage issue, Israeli officials said talks were continuing with mediators in Cairo to secure the return of the remaining remains, as pressure mounts from the family and the public to resolve the issue before the ceasefire moves forward.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/blast-in-gaza-injures-israeli-soldier-amid-ceasefire-tensions", "date": "2025-12-26T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 345},

Speaking during his annual televised “Direct Line” question-and-answer marathon on Friday, Putin told the BBC that Russia would not launch any new military operations if the West respected Russian interests and stopped what he described as deception over Nato’s eastward expansion. He again accused Western leaders of breaking promises made to the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, a claim previously denied by the late Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin said Russia was ready to work with Europe, the United States and the United Kingdom as equals and expressed willingness to end the war in Ukraine, provided Russia’s long-term security was guaranteed. However, he reiterated demands previously outlined in June, including Ukraine withdrawing forces from four partially occupied regions and abandoning its bid to join Nato. The nearly four-and-a-half-hour event, broadcast live from Moscow, combined questions from the public and journalists, with organisers claiming more than three million submissions. While the programme was largely choreographed, some critical comments about rising prices, internet outages and public services were shown on screen. Putin also addressed economic challenges, including inflation and a VAT increase set to take effect in January, as Russia’s central bank announced a cut in interest rates to 16%. Hours after the broadcast, Ukrainian officials reported that a Russian missile strike in the southern Odesa region killed seven people and injured 15 others.

National broadcaster NHK reported that there was no noticeable change in conditions at either port.Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said there were no immediate signs of abnormalities at the region’s nuclear facilities.NHK said that the level of shaking from the quake was less than a bigger magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit in the same region on Monday.and tore apart roads, smashed windows and triggered tsunami waves of up to 70cm (2.3 feet).Following Monday’s earthquake, which injured at least 50 people, the JMA issued a rare special advisory warning to residents across a wide area, from Hokkaido in the north to Chiba, east of Tokyo, to be on alert for an increased possibility of a powerful earthquake hitting again within a week.The northeast region is haunted by the memory of a massive magnitude 9.0 undersea quake in 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left about 18,500 people dead or missing.The JMA issued its first special advisory in 2024 for the southern half of Japan’s Pacific coast, warning of a possible “megaquake” along the Nankai Trough.The government has said that a quake in the Nankai Trough and subsequent tsunami could kill as many as 298,000 people and cause up to $2 trillion in damage.Amid fears of a “megaquake”, NHK reported on Thursday that people in the northeast of Japan were stocking up on disaster-related goods such as torches, water storage tanks and support poles to prevent furniture from toppling over due to tremors.One shop in Hokkaido’s Hakodate city reported that sales of bottled water and disaster kits had tripled following Monday’s quake. “We decided to prepare, so I bought disaster kits for everyone,” a male customer in his 30s told NHK while visiting a shop with his family.Japan sits on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is one of the world’s most seismically active countries, experiencing about 1,500 earthquakes a year.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/tsunami-warning-lifted-after-latest-earthquake-hits-japan", "date": "2025-12-13T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 421},

Carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans, the protesters broke through multiple police barricades, forcing security personnel to struggle to contain the crowd in the high-security diplomatic zone, according to Indian media, including PTI and ANI. Police had earlier stepped up security in the area in anticipation of the demonstration announced by Hindu right-wing groups, citing concerns over the death of a Hindu youth in a lynch-mob attack in Bangladesh. Besides, hundreds of protesters attempted to march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata but were stopped by police. The march, titled ‘Hindu Hunkar Padayatra’, was organised under the banner of Bongiyo Hindu Jagaran, reports PTI. The procession began from Sealdah and was heading towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission when police intercepted it in the Beckbagan area. Police set up barricades to prevent the protesters from advancing, witnesses said. A large contingent of police personnel was deployed in and around the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission office to maintain law and order amid the protest. Dipu Chandra Das, 28, a garment worker, was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Bhaluka Upazila of Mymensingh district December 18 and his body was later set on fire.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma and expressed deep concern over violent protests staged outside the premises of the different Diplomatic Missions of Bangladesh in India.

The TIB, local chapter of Berlin-based Transparency International — a global anti-corruption organisation, called the attacks as “organised” and “unprecedented”. The TIB made the remarks in a statement issued on Friday, also expressing concern and condemnation over the killing of Inqilab Moncho Convenor Sharif Osman bin Hadi.After the news of Hadi’s death while undergoing treatment in Singapore spread, groups of people took to the streets in protest. A mob vandalised and carried out arson attacks on The Daily Star and Prothom Alo newspaper offices. Another mob attacked the Chhayanaut building in Dhanmondi, vandalising furniture at the Bengali cultural organisation and setting it on fire, reports bdnews24.com The TIB said in the statement the government has failed to arrest Hadi’s assailants.TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman pointed out the interim government’s shortsightedness and inefficiency in addressing the instability and security risks caused by public outrage over the allegations that it failed to arrest all those involved in the targeted shooting and even helped some flee to a neighbouring country. The government cannot evade this responsibility, he said. On the other hand, following the fall of the authoritarian regime, the angry and vengeful behaviour of certain factions claiming credit for the political changeover is giving rise to a new form of repressive tendencies in the state and society, the TIB statement said.“Free media, dissent, and freedom of speech have become direct victims of this,” the statement said.TIB said the government, taking “a submissive stance” after the political change after the fall of the authoritarian government, expanded the scope of intolerance, violence, and instability.The anti-corruption organisation refused to view the attacks on The Daily Star, Prothom Alo and Chhayanaut, the assault of New Age Editor Nurul Kabir or the burning of Dipu Chandra Das as isolated incidents.“…rather, they are glaring examples of the deliberate suppression of freedom of thought, dissent, and freedom of speech. In a Bangladesh that aspires to be an independent democracy, such destructive attacks are not only unacceptable but also stand as evidence of the state’s embarrassing failure to fulfill its fundamental responsibilities,” the TIB statement said.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/tib-condemns-hadis-death", "date": "2025-12-20T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 378},

{"title": "Thai PM dissolves parliament", "body": "Thailand’s prime minister dissolved parliament on Friday, paving the way for general elections early next year as deadly border clashes continue with neighbor Cambodia.The move comes earlier than expected and just three months after Anutin Charnvirakul — of the conservative Bhumjaithai party — became prime minister when his predecessor was removed from office over an ethics violation.“The House of Representatives is dissolved to hold a new general election for members of the House,” a decree published in the Royal Gazette on Friday said.Anutin was widely expected to wait until after Christmas to dissolve parliament. “Since the administration is a minority government and domestic political conditions are fraught with multiple challenges, the government cannot continue administering state affairs continuously, efficiently, and with stability,” the Royal Gazette said, citing a report received from Anutin.“Therefore, the appropriate solution is to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a new general election.”The dissolution comes as fighting stemming from a decades-long territorial dispute over ancient temples has flared again on the border with Cambodia, where clashes have killed at least 20 people and displaced around 600,000, mostly in Thailand.In a statement, Cambodia’s defense ministry said the Thai military continued to shell and fire machine guns into Cambodian territory on Friday morning.AFP journalists heard continuous artillery fire at the border on Friday, ahead of an expected call between Anutin and US President Donald Trump, who has made vocal attempts to broker peace between the Southeast Asian neighbors.At the congressional ball at the White House on Thursday night, Trump claimed again to have solved eight wars.“Although Thailand and Cambodia, I think I’m going to have to make a couple of phone calls on Thailand, but we’ll get that one back on track,” he said.The two countries have blamed each other for the fresh fighting, which saw Thailand launch air strikes and use tanks against its neighbor on Monday.Evacuees at a shelter in Thailand’s Surin province told AFP they were less concerned about who leads the new government than about who would improve their lives along the border. “I just care that the leader, whoever that is, is someone who helps ordinary farmers like us,” said 68-year-old Somrak Suebsoontorn.Under Thai law, elections must be held between 45 and 60 days after parliament is dissolved, meaning polls are expected around the end of January or early February.Anutin said in a Facebook post late Thursday he “would like to return power to the people,” a signal in the kingdom that a prime minister intends to dissolve parliament.His coalition backer, the People’s Party, said Thursday it would submit a motion of no-confidence in Anutin, claiming Bhumjaithai broke its agreement during a crucial vote on constitutional amendments.“They said they wouldn’t support me anymore. They asked me to dissolve the house. I just followed their request,” Anutin told reporters Friday outside the Government House.The cannabis-championing conservative took power in September with coalition backing conditional on dissolving parliament, becoming the kingdom’s third leader in two years.He was once an ally of the influential political clan of Thaksin Shinawatra — who have been a dominant force in Thai politics since the turn of the century, but are increasingly faltering after a succession of legal and political setbacks.Anutin abandoned his coalition with their Pheu Thai Party this summer in apparent outrage over former Thai prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra’s conduct during the border row with Cambodia.During his three months in office, Anutin has had to deal with the escalating military conflict, as well as attacks on scam hubs in Myanmar, driving hundreds across the border into Thailand, and the death of the former queen Sirikit in October.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/thai-pm-dissolves-parliament", "date": "2025-12-13T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 600},

Salmon is 16 years, 103 days and came on for Ben White at Jan Breydelstadion, with Manager Mikel Arteta saying: “We knew that at some point we had to use him.” “He’s so young, 16 still, and he’s playing in the Champions League,” Arteta said.But Salmon is not even the youngest player that Arsenal has fielded this season.That distinction goes to Max Dowman, who was 15 years, 308 days when he entered as a second-half substitute against Slavia Prague last month. According to UEFA, Salmon is the third player 16 or younger that Arsenal has fielded in the Champions League after Dowman and former midfielder Jack Wilshere. “That’s why we put so much work and everybody in the academy puts (in) so much enthusiasm and work,” said Arteta. “And for a long time, you have to prepare those talents. So, thanks to them, because when we need them, they are there, they are ready to perform.” Dowman is the youngest player ever to play in European club soccer’s top competition – taking that record from Youssoufa Moukoko, who was 16 years, 18 days when he appeared for Borussia Dortmund in 2020. Barcelona superstar Lamine Yamal is the third youngest, having made his debut in the competition at the age of 16 years, 68 days in 2023.

City’s win put them on 37 points, one more than the Gunners ahead of their late kick-off, but that lead lasted for only a few hours as Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres scored from the spot midway through the first half after a handball at a corner by Everton’s Jake O’Brien. O’Brien looked like he was trying to rebound a basketball rather than defend a set piece, going up with both hands above his head, and referee Samuel Barrott had no hesitation in pointing to the spot after a VAR review. The goal settled the visitors and they began to dominate possession, with Gyokeres making a charge down the left early in the second half before he was swallowed up in the box by the Everton defence, while Saka was denied by Jordan Pickford moments later. A minute later, Everton’s Thierno Barry went sprawling in the box after a challenge by Martin Zubimendi but the referee waved away the home side’s appeal for a penalty. Arsenal should have sealed the win in the 64th minute with a sweeping move but Leandro Trossard smacked his shot off the far post with Pickford beaten. Though Everton did their best to get the ball in the box to force an equaliser, they lacked the guile necessary to breach the visiting defence. With their next game against Brighton & Hove Albion next Saturday, the win moves Arsenal to 39 points, two ahead of Manchester City. Everton slip to 10th in the table on 24 points, behind Brighton on goal difference. The goal was the first for Gyokeres since he returned from a hamstring injury at the end of November, and the way he blasted home from the spot illustrated how much he wanted to see the ball hit the back of the net. “It’s a few (Arsenal players) that can take it, and this time it was me that took it. It was important to score that one. It was nice,” he told Sky Sports. “You always want to score goals, that’s the main target every game for attacking players, that’s what we want to do.

{"title": "Tarique Rahman reaches Gulshan residence", "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman has reached Gulshan residence after visiting ailing mother and former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia at Evercare Hospital here. He reached his residence at house number 196 on Gulshan Avenue at around 8.25pm today. Earlier, he arrived at Evercare hospital at around 6pm after attending a mammoth public gathering at July 36 Expressway (popularly known as 300-Feet Road) to welcome him on his historic homecoming from London. After a long time, being reunited with critically ill mother on home soil, he became overwhelmed with emotion. Tarique Rahman spoke with the physicians at Evercare Hospital and inquired about his mother’s latest physical condition. He spent some times by his mother’s side for quite a while. At that time, his wife Dr Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman were with him. Tarique Rahman returned home after a long 17 years in exile in the UK. He arrived at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport here around 11.40am by a regular Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight after departing from London’s Heathrow Airport at 6.15pm (London Time) on Wednesday. He was accorded warm reception and emotional greetings at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on arrival from London. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir led the party standing committee members to greet the acting chairman and accord reception at the VVIP lounge of the airport after his return from London as Tarique Rahman embraced them with a wide smile and warm handshake. He also exchanged pleasantries with the BNP men present at the airport and waved his hand towards them. His mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu welcomed him with a flower bouquet as his wife Dr. Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman accompanied him. After airport proceedings, he started journey to the July 36 Expressway (popularly known as 300-Feet Road) venue by a bus amid tight security. He came out of the airport and touched down the soil with dew dropped grasses barefoot before traveling to the brief public event venue at 36 Expressway (300-Foot Road). He also grasped a fist of soil, brought to nose and sniffed being emotional. Then, a motorcade escorted Tarique Rahman’s bus to the venue as millions of people standing on the both sides of airport road bound to 300 feet welcomed him with chanting slogans. A festive atmosphere prevailed at the area from airport to 300 feet as enthusiasm and excitement were evident among the activists. Some celebrated Tarique Rahman’s return by waving the national flag, others carried the party symbol Dhaner Shis (Sheaf of Paddy), while some wore colourful attire and beat drums. The people chanted various slogans including ‘Tarique Rahman Asche, Ma-Mati Dakche’, ‘Ajker Ei Din e, Shaheed Zia Mone Pore’, ‘Tomar Amar Marka, Dhaner Shis Marka’, ‘Tarique Rahmaner Agomon, Suveceshha Sagotom’, ‘Desh Neta Asche, Bangladesh Kapche’ etc. Tarique Rahman also replied them with waiving hand on board the bus, making an extra-ordinary emotional scenario. He reached the public event venue at July 36 Expressway (300-Foot Road) around 3.40pm. In his address at the mammoth gathering, Tarique Rahman has shared his plan to build a developed and prosperous Bangladesh with collective efforts of all, reiterating his call to maintain peace and order at any cost. “We want peace . . . we want to build a safe Bangladesh for all. We have to keep calm and patience in facing any provocation,” he said. He added: “Let us take a pledge to make united efforts to build our expected Bangladesh”. Referring to a popular quote from US civil right activist Martin Luther King “I Have a dream”, Tarique Rahman said, “I have a plan for the people of my country and for my country.” “Today, this plan is for the interest of the people, for the development of the country, for changing the destiny of the people of this country,” he said. Tarique Rahman sought people’s cooperation to realize his plan to change the fortune of the countrymen. “If that plan, that course of action, that vision is to be implemented, dear brothers and sisters, from this sea of people present here today, and from all those across Bangladesh who represent the strength of democracy, I will need the cooperation of every single person,” he said. The day’s historic address by Tarique Rahman coincides with the famous speech of Martin Luther King as both the speeches spanned around 17 minutes. Tarique Rahman said the people of Bangladesh now want to regain their democratic rights and right to speak. “Today the people of Bangladesh want to receive fair rights according to their qualifications. Now is time for everyone to build the country together,” he said. Tarique Rahman presented a vision of a pluralistic and inclusive society. He spoke of the dream of building a safe Bangladesh through the collective effort of all religious communities—Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, and people from the hills and plains. Senior leaders of BNP and different political parties were in the stage of the mammoth gathering. After addressing the event, Tarique Rahman went to Evercare Hospital to see her ailing mother. As per his programme schedule, on December 26, Tarique Rahman will leave his residence after Jummah prayers to go to the grave of BNP founder Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman and offer prayers for eternal peace of the departed soul of his father. Then he will visit National Martyrs’ Memorial in Savar and pay his homage to Liberation War Martyrs there. On the December 27, he will accomplish his NID card and voter registration process, after which he will visit the grave of Shaheed Osman Hadi and offer munajat. Then he will go to the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (Pangu Hospital) to see those injured in the July mass uprising. The BNP however has prepared a separate chamber for the Acting Chairman at the Chairperson’s office in Gulshan, according to party sources. A separate chamber has also been allocated for him at the Naya Paltan central office. The party has also rented a new office space, building number 10/C on Road 90 in Gulshan to manage the upcoming 13th parliamentary election, and it will also include a separate chamber for Tarique Rahman. Tarique Rahman will conduct all party activities from the chamber. He will contest the upcoming 13th National Parliament Election, to be held on February 12 from the Bogura-6 constituency. History shows that time answers all questions in politics, and this rings true for Tarique Rahman. He once left for the UK for medical treatment under the red eye of so-called one eleven government, living in exile. Today, after a decade and a half, he is returning to the country’s soil after becoming a leader of the masses and a symbol of national unity. Tarique Rahman’s long political journey was not smooth. During the 2001-2006 administration, a mountain of controversies was intentionally created against him, and numerous lawsuits were filed. The then-opposition party Awami League, the 1/11 government, and an influential segment of civil society consistently leveled accusations against him. During the infamous 1/11 government, Tarique Rahman was arrested on March 7, 2007. He suffered inhumane physical torture while in remand, leading to severe illness. He was released on bail on September 3, 2008. After 18 months of imprisonment, he went to London for treatment. More than 17 years have passed since then, a long life in exile, without touching the soil of his homeland. After the Awami League came to power through the election on December 29, 2008, they obstructed the path of democracy by abolishing the caretaker government through the 15th Amendment of constitution on June 30, 2011, thus blocking the path to a fair election. Begum Khaleda Zia was evicted from her house, and autocrat Sheikh Hasina established a coercive regime. In February 2018, Begum Khaleda Zia was sentenced and imprisoned in a false corruption case. In her absence, Tarique Rahman took the reins of the party from nearly 8,000 kilometers away. He took the responsibility of Acting Chairman from Senior Vice Chairman. Since then, he has been engaged in the movement to restore democracy in the country, vocal and steadfast against enforced disappearances, killings and torture. The time in exile in the UK was also a period of immense personal hardship for Tarique Rahman. The death of his younger brother Arafat Rahman Koko left him mentally shattered. Simultaneously, the BNP Chairperson and his mother Begum Khaleda Zia faced imprisonments, illnesses, and medical crises due to political vendetta. In this reality, Tarique Rahman focused steadily on keeping the organization intact from a distant location. Knowing that the fascist ruling class wanted to politically eliminate him, he built a people centered resistance system instead of a self-centered movement, stating clearly, “The path Bangladesh will take will be decided on the streets,” a testament to his patience and composed leadership. Despite his long exile in the distant UK, he became the central driving force of the BNP in terms of party decisions, strategic planning, and political directives. Tarique Rahman has earned a place in the hearts of leaders and activists at all levels of the party. In his political character, party workers and supporters find legacy of the BNP founder Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman. Leaders and activists say that the main strength of a leader’s leadership lies in their sense of justice and mentality. Tarique Rahman is such a leader, who was the closest even from the farthest distance. Tarique Rahman’s return home on December 25 is not merely a personal or party event; it marks an emotional and deeply meaningful chapter in Bangladesh’s political history. His return has created new hope among BNP leaders, activists, supporters and even the whole countrymen. They believe that his return will reorganize the party after a long political stalemate, and simultaneously create a new reality in national politics. It is also believed that under his leadership, democracy and civil rights will return to the country, ushering in a new chapter of political stability.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/tarique-rahman-reaches-gulshan-residence", "date": "2025-12-25T20:57:03+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 1655},

Nabanna utsob (Harvest festival) is prevailing in villages, Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) and other sources said. In this harvesting season, the courtyards of farmers, across the country are now filled with the aroma of newly harvested Aman paddy. Amid the harvesting rush, the festive spirit of Nabanna (harvest festival) has returned to villages. With new rice entering homes, preparations for celebrations have begun. Rural areas are once again buzzing with activity and life. Farmers are passing very busy days harvesting and threshing paddy. Local haat and markets are now overflowing with new rice. According to DAE sources, harvesting has already been completed over 50 percent of Aman fields across the country. Farmers shared that they are satisfied with the prices they are currently receiving in local markets. The late varieties of Aman paddy harvesting are still ongoing in different districts. Farmers say that due to excessive rainfall and flooding, waterlogging has caused damage to paddy in some areas of the country. However, overall yields are good. Still, accurate production data can only be confirmed after harvesting is fully completed. In Faridpur, farmers nearly completed Aman harvesting. Farmer Miraz Hossain, of Dadpur village in Boalmari upazila of Faridpur district told The New Nation on Thursday that Aman paddy yielding are fine in the area.

The New Nation’s Patuakhali correspondent Abdus Salam Arif said on Thursday harvesting of Aman paddy has only just begun. Yields have been good. In Dumki upazila of Patuakhali, the Aman harvesting season is now underway, with golden paddy fields stretching far and wide. From dawn to dusk, farmers remain busy harvesting rice.

He said BNP and Jamaat are competing to secure Awami League votes, with members of the ousted party openly joining them, but there has been no solution on the Awami League issue yet. “If the Awami League problem is not resolved, it will continue to resurface. In that case, a ‘Truth and Reconciliation Commission’ should be formed, and the political and civic rights of Awami League supporters should be restored on the condition that they seek forgiveness,” Nahid said. Calling for the dissolution of the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Nahid said, “RAB must be dissolved. We have been demanding its dissolution from the very beginning. Alongside abolishing RAB, institutions like the DGFI must also be brought under accountability.” On the upcoming election, he said, many are viewing it solely as a national election, but the referendum must also be kept in mind, stressing that the July Uprising must not be compromised under any circumstances.

We requested them today (Wednesday) to think about whether these dates can be reconsidered,” NCP Chief Coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary told reporters after a meeting between a NCP delegation and Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin at the latter’s office in the city. The Election Commission on December 11 announced the schedule to hold the 13th parliamentary election and the referendum on the July National Charter (Constitutional Reform) Implementation Order on February 12 next.

Patwary alleged that the Awami League, in different ways, along with India, is trying to destabilise Bangladesh in an attempt to delay the election. “The Election Commission wants to organise the election on February 12. From the National Citizen Party, we have said that this announced date must not be postponed and that the election should be held on time. Because the Awami League, in different ways, and India, are trying to destabilise Bangladesh to delay the election. We asked the Election Commission today to ensure that the election is held on schedule,” he said. Replying to a question if there are any concerns regarding the February 12 elections, he said there are concerns in Bangladesh, but NCP repeatedly urged the Election Commission to ensure that the election is held on February 12. “We have asked the Election Commission not to make any small mistakes that could cause the (polling) date to be postponed. Today, we requested whether the nomination papers related dates could be reconsidered,” he said.

{"title": "BNP, Jamaat in strong position", "body": "Mohibbul Arefin, Rajshahi : The polling field for the 6 parliamentary constituencies of Rajshahi is bustling with excitement for the upcoming 13th National Parliament elections. The main competitors in each constituency are BNP and Jamaat. However, BNP is in a state of turmoil in the Rajshahi-1 constituency due to party infighting. There have been incidents of clashes and violence within the BNP, including protests and rallies demanding a change of candidate. There is even a fear of a ‘rebel candidate’. And on this occasion, Jamaat has made a strong position for itself in the constituency. Rajshahi-1 constituency consists of Godagari and Tanor upazilas of Rajshahi district. In the 12 elections held after independence, BNP and AL candidates won 10 times each, while Jamaat-e-Islami candidates won once and an independent candidate won once. And in the controversial elections of 2014, 2018, 2024, Awami League candidates won. The total number of voters here in 2018 was 383,352, in 2023-24 it was 440,218 and this time the number of voters has increased to 468,362. This is an increase of 28,144 voters compared to the previous year. As a result, the number of new voters is more than 28,000. The information received related to the election has revealed that these new and young voters will have a considerable impact in the next election. For the 13th National Parliament election, BNP announced the names of candidates for 34 out of 39 seats in Rajshahi division from the center on November 3. According to the announcement, the new candidate of BNP in Rajshahi-1 constituency is Adviser to the Chairperson and District BNP member Major General (Retd.) Sharif Uddin. He is the brother of former Posts and Telecommunications Minister late Barrister Aminul Haque. Barrister Aminul Haque was elected MP in 1991-96 and 2001. There were several other leaders seeking nomination here. Among them were Supreme Court lawyer Mahfuzur Rahman Milon, Godagari Upazila BNP member Advocate Sultanul Islam Tarek, former district BNP vice-president Sajedur Rahman Marconi, Zia Parishad leader Principal Abdullah Al Mahmud Biplob and engineer KM Jewel. On the other hand, in 1986, the current Naib-e-Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami, Professor Mujibur Rahman, won this seat. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami has declared him as the party’s candidate in the upcoming thirteenth election. In the 1991 national election, he was defeated by a margin of only 25,917 votes. While the winning candidate Aminul Haque got 61,975.However, the conflict between Sharif Uddin and Tarek’s followers is the most obvious. There were several clashes and counter-cases between their supporters. In addition, after the nomination was announced, leaders and activists in some unions protested against Sharif Uddin. They alleged that he was not known in the area and had not been in field politics for a long time. By excluding local qualified leaders, ‘a candidate has been imposed by sitting in Dhaka’. A union BNP leader said in an angry voice, “Suddenly bringing in people from Dhaka and excluding those who faced cases and attacks during the party’s difficult times means insulting the grassroots.” Meanwhile, the election campaign has been put on hold due to Begum Khaleda Zia’s illness.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/bnp-jamaat-in-strong-position", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 514},

{"title": "New membership rules set by BGMEA to uphold factory safety", "body": "The apex body of Bangladesh’s apparel sector, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), has introduced stricter criteria for granting membership to garment factories, aiming to uphold minimum operational and safety standards. Under the new rules, factories located in shared buildings with other establishments such as banks, insurance offices, or markets will no longer be eligible for BGMEA registration. However, buildings that house only garment units may be considered for membership approval.The decision, finalised in a notification on the last week, follows the BGMEA board’s third meeting on November 5. The trade body said the measures are designed to promote a sustainable ready-made garment (RMG) industry and support the country’s socio-economic development. New criteria require woven or knit garment factories to operate at least 100 machines, while sweater factories must have a minimum of 60 machines. Additionally, factories must maintain a floor space of at least 15,000 square feet to qualify for BGMEA membership. Factories seeking reinstatement of membership will also need to submit updated trade licences, tax certificates, and factory licences, along with clearance of any outstanding dues. BGMEA Senior Vice President Inamul Haq Khan said the measures were taken to ensure minimum safety and operational standards and to prevent accidents. “Fire incidents in BGMEA member factories have declined significantly over the past several years and are now rare,” he added. He emphasized that the association, as an owners’ trade body, is often held responsible whenever incidents occur in garment factories, regardless of whether the factory is a member. “We won’t provide membership to any sick industry,” Mr Khan said, noting that most non-compliance and wage-related issues are found in non-member factories operating under national initiatives. Citing a recent fire at a chemical factory in the capital, Mr Khan said a nearby non-BGMEA garment unit caught fire due to sparks originating from the chemical facility, highlighting the risks of non-compliant operations. Currently, BGMEA has around 4,500 member factories, with 60 percent producing woven garments and 40 percent knitwear and sweaters. BGMEA members account for 100 percent of woven garment exports, over 95 percent of sweater shipments, and roughly half of light knitwear exports. Bangladesh earned US$39.34 billion from RMG exports in the last fiscal year (FY25), underscoring the importance of maintaining safety and operational standards in the sector.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/new-membership-rules-set-by-bgmea-to-uphold-factory-safety", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 380},

{"title": "I don’t want to join any political party: Sohini", "body": "Rumours of Sohini Sarkar, a popular actress of West Bengal, joining politics started after the Abhaya incident. At that time, the way Sohini was active and vocal about the whole incident, many assumed that she might soon be seen on the political stage. There was a reason behind such a thought. Many Tollywood actors and actresses have been seen joining politics after speaking out on social issues in the past. However, even after a year of the Abhaya incident, this actress has not been seen joining any political party till now. However, recently, during the promotions of the film ‘Raghu Dakat’, discussions resumed over an incident involving Sohini’s dancing with a Trinamool leader. In this context, Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh also made oblique comments about the actress. Sohini has finally clarified her position. In an interview given to Indian media, she directly announced her entry into politics. Sohini said, “Even if an offer comes to me, I still do not want to join any political party in any way, in any sense. Be it Trinamool or Congress, BJP or CPM, I do not want to be part of any political party. If I ever become part of a political party, I will have nothing more to say. I will have to become completely silent then.” In recent years, it has been seen that many stars of the small and big screen are actively involved in political parties. While there was a time when artistes kept themselves away from political matters, now that picture has largely reversed. From Dev to big stars like Mithun Chakraborty, they are now actively involved in politics.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/i-dont-want-to-join-any-political-party-sohini", "date": "2025-12-10T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 271},

The other ministries and divisions with poor spending performance are the Financial Institutions Division, Internal Resources Division (IRD), Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs, Security Services Division, Health Education and Family Welfare Division, Health Services Division, and Public Security Division. The information was revealed in the latest ADP implementation update for July-November published by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) of the Planning Ministry. According to IMED officials, the Parliamentary Affairs Secretariat had an allocation of Tk 20 lakh for a project but has so far failed to spend any of the funds, raising concerns about delays in project preparation and administrative approvals. Similarly, the Health Services Division spent only Tk 293 crore in the first five months against an allocation of Tk 7,484 crore for 15 projects. The Health Education and Family Welfare Division spent just Tk 86 crore against its allocation of Tk 4,810 crore, reflecting slow procurement and weak project execution. During the period, the Financial Institutions Division spent 2.31 percent of its allocation, the IRD 2.12 percent, the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs 3.30 percent, the Security Services Division 2.43 percent, and the Public Security Division only 1.25 percent. Overall ADP implementation during July-November stood at just 11.75 percent, the lowest rate recorded in the past six years, according to IMED data. In total, Tk 28,043 crore was spent under the ADP during the first five months of the fiscal year, nearly Tk 6,000 crore less than the expenditure recorded in the same period last year. Officials and economists say the sluggish implementation reflects capacity constraints, lengthy approval processes and cautious spending amid economic uncertainty. They warn that continued delays could slow development momentum and affect growth if project execution does not accelerate in the remaining months. For the current fiscal year, the government has adopted an ADP worth Tk 238,695 crore, covering the implementation of 1,198 development projects.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/eight-ministries-fail-to-spend-over-5pc-of-adp-funds-in-first-five-months", "date": "2025-12-22T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 357},

The constituency, which consists of the entire Rajshahi City Corporation area, is always at the center of discussion. Although former mayor Mizanur Rahman Minu’s clean image and long political experience in local politics give him an additional advantage, there is a strong opposition from the party. On the other hand, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami candidate and Nayeb-e-Amir of the metropolis, Dr. Muhammad Jahangir, has entered the field as a strong opponent. Considering the popularity in the voting field, the strong position of the organization and recent public opinion, there is a hint of a tough fight between the two candidates in this election. Meanwhile, Mobashware Ali, convener of the Rajshahi Metropolitan Committee, has received the nomination of the National Citizens Committee (NCP) in the Rajshahi-2 constituency. After receiving the party nomination, he conducted limited election mass mobilization. Besides, although the names of the candidates of Khilafat Majlis, BSD, Gana Sanghati Andolan and Gana Adhikar Parishad have come to the fore, they have not campaigned.Rajshahi-2 (Sadar) is the most important constituency in Rajshahi administratively and politically among the parliamentary constituencies. Due to the active presence of government and private offices, educational institutions, business and commerce and civil society, the impact of this constituency in national politics is also significant.According to the latest updated data of the Election Commission, the participation of urban educated and middle-class voters in the constituency is relatively high. Young voters, employees, businessmen and women voters play an important role in determining the result here. In addition, this time, civic issues including the July Revolution, party conflicts and the Awami League’s vote bank will play an important role. Due to which, the thirteenth election and the previous elections and subsequent significant events may change the different political trends and issue-based attitudes of the voters.The total number of voters in Rajshahi-2 constituency is 3 lakh 52 thousand 783, of which 1 lakh 71 thousand 418 are male voters and 1 lakh 81 thousand 359 are female voters. There are 8 third gender (hijra) voters. And there are 115 polling stations. The boundaries of the constituency were redrawn before the 1986 elections. And the data analysis shows that BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami had a strong influence on this constituency from the very beginning in the 1990s. Although Awami League played an active role here in the later stage, they were left out of the actual calculation in the controversial election. Meanwhile, in the fifth national parliament election of 1991, BNP’s Kabir Hossain got 43.40 percent of the votes and Jamaat-e-Islami’s candidate Ataur Rahman got 21.50 percent of the votes.

With seven goals and three assists in the league in 17 appearances this season, Rogers has helped Villa up to third in the table on 36 points and into the title race, hot on the heels of leaders Arsenal (39 points) and Manchester City (37). The home side did not look like a team on a winning run for much of the first half, but that changed when John McGinn picked out Rogers in the 45th minute.Brimming with confidence, the 23-year-old brought the ball down and kept it in play before cutting into the box and curling a superb shot past keeper Senne Lammens and into the top corner. United managed to level before the break when Matty Cash was robbed to the right of the Villa penalty area and Matheus Cunha blasted the loose ball past Emiliano Martinez, but their joy was short-lived as captain Bruno Fernandes had to be substituted at halftime due to injury.Fernandes was replaced by Lisandro Martinez, who normally plays as a defender, and the Argentine made the most of his cameo in a more advanced position to fire off an early shot as United sought to get back in the game.The fightback was short-lived, however, as Rogers netted again in the 57th minute with another curled effort past Lammens.United substitute Shea Lacey fired a late effort into the midriff of the Villa keeper and Mason Mount sent a free kick over the bar, but Villa held on to leave the visitors seventh in the table as the home fans heralded their goal-scorer.“It’s hard work, it’s long hours and you want every one to go in the top corner like that, so it’s nice when one does go in,” Rogers said of his shooting prowess.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/superb-rogers-double-gives-aston-villa-2-1-win-over-man-utd", "date": "2025-12-23T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 325},

The revised fares came into effect on Saturday, December 20. Railway authorities clarified that the increase has not been applied to base ticket prices. Instead, the additional cost has been imposed as a “pontage charge,” which is intended to cover the maintenance and upkeep of railway bridges along key corridors. The routes affected by the new charge include Dhaka-Chattogram, Dhaka-Cox’s Bazar, Dhaka-Sylhet, Chattogram-Sylhet, Chattogram-Jamalpur, and Dhaka-Dewanganj. Officials said a total of 11 bridges on these routes have been brought under the pontage system, with charges varying depending on distance and seat category.

{"title": "No spinner for Australia on ‘grassy’ MCG pitch", "body": "Australia will not play a spinner in the Boxing Day Test on a Melbourne pitch stand-in captain Steve Smith described as “quite furry, quite green”. The home side have named a 12-man squad for the fourth Ashes Test against England, starting today. The group includes only specialist pace bowlers, meaning off-spinner Todd Murphy misses out. Smith, deputising as captain for Pat Cummins, said Australia will play four seamers, plus all-rounder Cameron Green. Michael Neser, Brendon Doggett and Jhye Richardson are vying for two places in the final XI. Smith is returning after missing the third Test through illness. Usman Khawaja was initially left out of the third Test, then replaced Smith and made scores of 82 and 40 in Adelaide. Khawaja is retained in Melbourne at the expense of Josh Inglis. Khawaja will bat at number five, with all-rounder Green dropping to seven. The previous Ashes Test in Melbourne, in 2021, was over inside three days as England were bowled out for 185 and 68. “I daresay it’s going to offer quite a bit,” said Smith in his Christmas Day news conference. “Tomorrow looks similar conditions today – quite cold and overcast. There’s going to be quite a bit of movement in that surface.” Smith said there is 10mm of grass on the surface, leading to the furry and green description. Australia have already won the Ashes after moving 3-0 up in the first three Tests. The home side are now targeting a fourth 5-0 clean sweep, while England are looking to end an 18-match winless streak in this country. Players from both sides trained side-by-side in the nets on Christmas morning, with many of the England players and staff in Father Christmas hats. Families arrived to spend time on the Melbourne Cricket Ground outfield, before the squads left to celebrate. Australia are once again without captain Cummins, as he continues to manage a back problem, while fellow pace bowler Josh Hazlewood has missed the entire series. Off-spinner Nathan Lyon suffered a series-ending hamstring injury in the third Test in Adelaide, meaning Murphy was called into the squad.

After a mixed start in the qualification round on the opening day, hopes of a turnaround faded quickly as most of the home players bowed out early. In both men’s and women’s singles, Akib Sulaiman and Shuvo Khandakar, who had won their opening matches, suffered defeats in their second outings. Experienced national shuttlers such as Aiman Ibne Jaman and Al-Amin Jumar also failed to advance, while Nasima Khatun, despite winning her first match, could not carry the momentum into the next round. The trend continued on Wednesday morning as national champion Khandakar Abdus Sowad was also eliminated. Amid the gloom, Gaurab Singh stood tall as Bangladesh’s sole remaining contender in the singles draw. The three-time national champion from Sylhet secured his place in the last 32 with a convincing straight-games win over Australia’s Pushkal Iru Sumalla, winning 21-12, 21-12 with authority. After the match, Gaurab with smile, said, “I am very happy to have won today. The international level is very high, and you never know who will play well on a given day.” “One wins, another loses. I played well today, and that made the difference,” he added.Reflecting on his improvement, Gaurab revealed that he had undergone three months of intensive training ahead of the SAFF Games. “I stayed disciplined, trained under a foreign coach and worked on playing at full speed. Earlier, I used to struggle after 16 or 17 points, but I have worked hard to improve that,” he added. Gaurab also downplayed the importance of rankings in international competition. “Here, everyone is good and mostly unfamiliar. All opponents are new. Winning one round makes me feel better, and this victory will motivate me in the next matches. I will also play doubles today and try to do well. I want to be the best for the spectators and make my country proud,” he said. Bangladesh’s struggles extended to the doubles events as well.

Now, Bollywood actress Radhika Apte has spoken out about a similar experience. According to an Indian media report, Radhika got the opportunity to work in a big production film early in her acting career. But an unexpected incident happened before the shooting started. Radhika said that she had planned to go on a vacation before the shooting started. The actress had informed the concerned people about this in advance. She even made it clear that he would not go on a diet while travelling and that she might gain some weight. In Radhika’s words, “I was young then, my metabolism was also great. I knew I could lose weight quickly when I came back. But before the shoot, I had to participate in a photoshoot. There, I looked a little fat. I was dropped because I was fat.” After losing her big job, Radhika became mentally devastated. She developed a fear of weight. Even if she gained a little weight, she would panic that she might lose her job again. After going through this trauma for a long time, she was finally forced to seek help from a professional psychologist. Radhika recently became a mother. After giving birth, she naturally gained weight. However, after overcoming the trauma of the past, she is now learning to look at life in a new way.

Fernandes was forced out of Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa with a hamstring problem, which Amorim said at the time would rule the Portugal midfielder out of today’s visit of Newcastle. Amorim refused to put a definitive timescale on Fernandes’ absence when he spoke to the media on Wednesday, although he did say the expectation was it is “not going to take a lot of time”. Sources have said privately they believe the 31-year-old will return for the Manchester derby with City at Old Trafford on 17 January, which would mean a five-match absence. It is a huge blow at a time when key attackers Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations and Kobbie Mainoo, Fernandes’ obvious replacement, is also missing with a calf injury. “It is impossible to replace Bruno,” said Amorim. “I said that this morning to the team. “We need to take the good thing, if there is a good thing on that – a lot of people need to step up.” Fernandes has had a remarkable fitness record since his arrival from Sporting in January 2020. In the intervening six years, he has only missed two games through injury and one more due to illness, meaning his current absence will be by far his longest during his time with the Old Trafford club, even if it is not as bad as initial concerns about a six-week absence. “It is not just the creation,” said Amorim. “At every set-piece he is the guy who is organising the team. “He understands every position on the field, he pays attention to every detail. When you have a substitution, he is always the guy telling the other guys where they should be.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/impossible-to-replace-fernandes-could-miss-up-to-a-month", "date": "2025-12-26T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 313},

After a long time, being reunited with critically ill mother on home soil, he became overwhelmed with emotion. Tarique Rahman spoke with the physicians at Evercare Hospital and inquired about his mother’s latest physical condition. He spent some private time by his mother’s side for quite a while. His wife Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman were with him. From Evercare Hospital, the BNP’s Acting Chairman will proceed to the residence at house number 196 on Gulshan Avenue.

He was accorded warm reception and emotional greetings at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on arrival from London. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir led the party standing committee members to greet the acting chairman and accord reception at the VVIP lounge of the airport after his return from London as Tarique Rahman embraced them with a wide smile and warm handshake. He also exchanged pleasantries with the BNP men present at the airport and waved his hand towards them. His mother-in-law Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu welcomed him with a flower bouquet as his wife Dr. Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman accompanied him. After airport proceedings, he started journey to the July 36 Expressway (popularly known as 300-Feet Road) venue by a bus amid tight security. He came out of the airport and touched down the soil with dew dropped grasses barefoot before traveling to the brief public event venue at the 36 Expressway (300-Foot Road). He also grasped a fist of soil, brought to nose and sniffed being emotional. Then, a motorcade escorted Tarique Rahman’s bus to the venue as millions of people standing on the both sides of airport road bound to 300 feet welcomed him with chanting slogans.

The hosts were the only non-Premier League side left in the competition but they more than held their own against the Club World Cup winners who were forced to turn to their bench to overcome the League One leaders. “They were a very strong team. We weren’t focused on which league they play in,” Garnacho, who scored twice after coming on at halftime, told Sky Sports. “They did a really good job but we’re happy to be in the semi-final.” This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Cardiff were the better side in the opening half, enjoying plenty of possession early on and came closest to scoring through a deflected cross from Isaak Davies which forced Chelsea keeper Filip Jorgensen into a reaction save at his near post. Chelsea, lacking urgency, struggled to get in behind Cardiff who were very disciplined without the ball, and the boisterous crowd inside the sold-out Cardiff City Stadium cheered every challenge and clearance from the home side. “It was evident the players gave everything for the club,” Cardiff coach Brian Barry-Murphy told Sky Sports. “It was an incredible atmosphere and a memorable night.”Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca named an entirely changed starting 11 from the side that beat Everton 2-0 on Saturday, and after an underwhelming opening half he sent on Joao Pedro and Garnacho for the second half.“Sometimes you have to start games and sometimes you have to help from the bench,” Garnacho added.“We don’t focus on this, we just try to help the team. Me, Pedro and the rest of the players did that.”Garnacho had the first chance after the break with Cardiff keeper Nathan Trott making a fine save from the close-range effort but the substitute opened the scoring in the 57th minute with Chelsea capitalising on a poor pass out from the back.Facundo Buonanotte gathered possession, drove forward into the area and fed Garnacho who slipped his shot past Trott. Chelsea went looking for the killer second goal and Trott tipped over a Buonanotte strike from distance.The game looked to be slipping away from Cardiff before David Turnbull got on the end of Perry Ng’s floated cross into the box to steer his header beyond Jorgensen with 15 minutes left. “I guess it’s the hope that kills you,” Barry-Murphy added.“When we scored the goal, probably all got carried away, myself included, trying to get that second goal.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/garnacho-double-fires-chelsea-past-cardiff-into-league-cup-semi-finals", "date": "2025-12-18T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 457},

Both countries also claim to have acted in self-defense and accuse the other of attacking civilians.The United States, China and Malaysia brokered a truce to end five days of deadly clashes in July, but the ceasefire was short-lived. Earlier Friday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Facebook that he had spoken by phone with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the two discussed “ways to secure a ceasefire along the Cambodia-Thailand border.” The conflict stems from a territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometer (500-mile) frontier and a collection of temple ruins situated there.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/thailand-escalated-strikes-during-border-talks-cambodia", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 290},

{"title": "Sand extraction continues in Kamalganj", "body": "Moulvibazar Correspondent : In Kamalganj upazila of Moulvibazar, geo bags are being installed by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) along a vulnerable section of the Dhulai River embankment. However, on the opposite side, illegal sand extraction is continuing near the steel bridge adjacent to Mrittinga Tea Estate under Rahimpur Union. Due to concerns over potential damage to the river embankment and the bridge caused by sand extraction, local residents have submitted a written complaint to the Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner. Despite this, the illegal extraction has not been stopped. As a result, the Dhulai River embankment in the Dharmapur and Ramchandrapur areas, two bridges, and the surrounding environment are now under serious threat. A visit to the site revealed that geo bag installation work is ongoing at a risky section of the Dhulai River embankment near the Mrittanga steel bridge under Rahimpur Union, initiated by the BWDB. At the same location, sand is being extracted from the middle of the river using dredging machines on the opposite side. For nearly the past two months, a local leaseholder has been extracting sand from near the bridge. This has put the steel bridge and the geo bag embankment protection work at risk. Fearing damage to the embankment and the two bridges, local residents submitted a mass petition to the Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner in November. Local residents said that within a distance of just one and a half kilometres in Dharmapur and Ramchandrapur, there are two steel bridges over the Dhulai River. A few years ago, around 200 metres of the embankment on the northern side of the Mrittanga bridge collapsed, causing flooding and extensive damage to nearby areas. Recently, the BWDB started repair work by placing sand-filled geo bags along the embankment. At the same time, sand extraction using dredging machines from adjacent areas and near the bridge has put both the embankment and the two bridges at risk.Violation of the Soil and Sand Management Act, 2010 through such sand extraction is destroying the country’s valuable natural resources. Sand is being extracted from areas that are not designated as sand quarries, creating severe threats to the environment, ecology, and public life. However, the sand extractor claims that the activity is legal and conducted under a valid lease. Accused sand quarry leaseholder Khorshed Alam said, “My leased area is close to the bridge and the vulnerable embankment. Therefore, I am compelled to extract sand from here while ensuring the protection of the bridge.” Moulvibazar BWDB Executive Engineer Md Khaled Bin Walid stated that sand extraction cannot be carried out in any way from beside the protective blocks. Regarding the issue, Kamalganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Asaduzzaman said, “Sand extraction near a bridge cannot be allowed under any circumstances. Necessary action will be taken following an investigation.” On this matter, Moulvibazar Additional Deputy Commissioner Mosammat Shahina Akhter said, “I am looking into the issue. I will instruct the UNO to take appropriate action.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/sand-extraction-continues-in-kamalganj", "date": "2025-12-22T00:08:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 490},

{"title": "N’ganj-2 Constituency: BNP candidate Azad has Tk 80 cr bad loan, fake mortgage, ‘scapegoat’ alleged", "body": "Special Correspondent: Serious allegations of irregularities, fake mortgages, and forgery have been raised against BNP-nominated parliamentary candidate for the Narayanganj-2 constituency, Nazrul Islam Azad, centering on a loan of nearly Tk 80 crores takon from the state-owned BASIC Bank. At the center of the allegations is a partnership firm named S & G Steel, in which the accused individual is listed in records as the managing partner. Investigations reveal that, according to bank and land-related documents, the firm took a loan in 2010 from BASIC Bank’s Gulshan branch under the Secured Over Draft (SOD) facility with special approval from the bank’s board. It is alleged that, in approving the loan, banking rules, proper risk assessment, and verification of actual ownership of the property were not duly carried out. The application states that a large portion of the land shown as mortgage against the loan was not actually owned by the firm or the accused individual. Disputes over the ownership of the land had long been pending before the Land Survey Tribunal. Despite this, the same land was presented to the bank as security for the loan. Documents further mention that some properties were mortgaged in the names of sleeping partners and elderly relatives, many of whom were not actively involved in actual business decisions. The complaint describes this as a strategy of using them as ‘scapegoats.’ According to the complainant, while ordinary banking procedures usually take a long time, the loan was approved at the board level within just 27 days. The application also mentions the influential role of the then bank board of directors and references to political connections in this regard. Currently, a large portion of the loan is reportedly classified as defaulted and under the ‘Bad and Loss’ category, according to documents. The outstanding amount, including interest, is alleged to be more than Tk 10 billion. Meanwhile, information regarding cases and orders related to land ownership, mutation, and mortgage issues in the Dhaka Land Survey Tribunal and other courts has been attached to the application. In some instances, although decrees and judgments exist, the complainant claims that such information was not fully presented to the bank or was concealed. Another highly sensitive aspect of the allegation is that despite such serious accusations of financial irregularities, the individual concerned is currently a nominated parliamentary candidate of a major political party. This has raised questions about political parties’ nomination processes, ethics, and financial transparency. While preparing this report, it was not possible to obtain a statement from the accused Narayanganj-2 constituency parliamentary candidate Nazrul Islam Azad, despite attempts to contact him. Efforts were also made to obtain statements from the concerned bank officials, but no comments were immediately available. However, if statements from the relevant parties are received, they will be published. Banking and legal experts say that if the allegations are true, this would be a major blow not just to a single bank or individual, but to the state-owned banking system as a whole. At the same time, they stress that a transparent and impartial investigation into such allegations is essential before contesting an election. He was not available for his comments though message was sent to his Whatsapp number.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/nganj-2-constituency-bnp-candidate-azad-has-tk-80-cr-bad-loan-fake-mortgage-scapegoat-alleged", "date": "2025-12-23T18:51:13+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 533},
{"title": "Nahid, Hasnat, Sarjis and Jara given gunmen", "body": "The government has moved to boster the personal security of July movement fighters, coordinators, parliamentary candidates and senior political leaders amid growing concerns over law and order ahead of the 13th national parliamentary elections. As part of the initiative, several frontline figures of the July movement have been provided with gunmen, while the process of issuing personal firearms licences is under way. Those receiving security include former interim government adviser and National Citizens Party (NCP) convener Nahid Islam, NCP southern region chief coordinator Hasnat Abdullah, senior joint member secretary Tasnim Jara, and northern region chief coordinator Sarjis Alam. Maintaining law and order ahead of the polls has emerged as a major challenge for the interim government. Intelligence agencies have warned of conspiracies by what officials describe as “fascist elements” aimed at destabilising the electoral process. July movement fighters have reportedly faced sustained threats since August 5 last year, the day former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fell from power. Government sources claim that activists linked to the banned Awami League and Chhatra League – some in hiding inside the country and others abroad – have been issuing death threats. Sheikh Hasina, currently in India, is also accused of inciting party supporters. The killing of Osman Hadi, a prominent July movement activist and spokesperson for the Inqilab Mancha, has intensified security concerns. Hadi had reportedly received death threats from foreign phone numbers for several months before he was shot dead on December 12. Despite receiving advanced medical treatment at home and abroad, he could not be saved. Following Hadi’s death, the government reassessed the security risks faced by July fighters and anti-fascist activists. Intelligence reports indicate that several figures, including AB Party leader Barrister Fuad and NCP coordinator Hasnat Abdullah, remain under constant threat. Several politicians and parliamentary candidates have formally applied for gunmen and firearms licences. Jamaat-e-Islami Amir Dr Shafiqur Rahman and Bangladesh Jatiya Party (JP) chairman Barrister Andaleeve Rahman Partha are already receiving gunmen from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP). Others expected to receive security include Ganosamhati Andolan chief coordinator Zonayed Saki, BNP-nominated candidate Tanvir Ahmed Robin from Demra-Jatrabari, BNP candidate Zafir Tuhin from Pabna-3, JP chairman and former minister Anwar Hossain Manju, and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president Colonel (retd) Oli Ahmed, among others.Special security arrangements have also been made for the family of Osman Hadi. One of his sisters is being issued a firearms licence and provided with a gunman, while round-the-clock police protection will be extended to other family members.Senior officials at the Ministry of Home Affairs and the police confirmed the developments. They said many July movement fighters across the country have sought gunmen and weapons licences, though it is not feasible to provide gunmen to everyone due to manpower constraints. Many applicants are students without personal vehicles and rely on public transport, making close-protection arrangements impractical.Nonetheless, the government is considering additional security measures for at-risk activists as well as potential candidates from BNP, Jamaat, NCP and allied parties. Applications submitted in writing are being prioritised, officials said.A senior police officer said security decisions are being made based on intelligence assessments. “A list has been prepared identifying individuals at risk. Work is under way on a priority basis. Not everyone seeking gunmen can be accommodated,” he said, adding that firearms licences fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Ministry and district administration.Home Ministry sources said that as of Sunday, 12 written applications had been received, with a meeting scheduled in the coming days to determine further action. While no July movement activist has formally applied for firearms so far, several parliamentary candidates have sought both gunmen and weapons.Officials clarified that gunmen currently assigned by the DMP and Special Branch are on a temporary basis. Permanent arrangements will be finalised once applications are approved by the ministry.Following a meeting of the Advisory Council Committee on Law and Order on Monday (December 22), Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said individuals identified as being at risk had already been given one gunman each based on intelligence assessments by DGFI, NSI and SB.Asked whether all those receiving gunmen were politicians, he declined to comment directly, saying journalists should “investigate and find out”.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/nahid-hasnat-sarjis-and-jara-given-gunmen", "date": "2025-12-23T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 697},

{"title": "Kepa eager for more League Cup heroics against Chelsea", "body": "Arsenal goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is relishing the prospect of knocking former club Chelsea out of the League Cup following his key role in a penalty shootout win over Crystal Palace. The Gunners went through to the semi-finals on Tuesday after Kepa saved Maxence Lacroix’s spot-kick in a dramatic 8-7 shootout success following a 1-1 draw with Palace at the Emirates Stadium. Kepa spent seven years with the Blues before moving to north London in pre-season and he could now deny his old side a spot in the first major final of the current campaign. Kepa, who has made all three of his Arsenal appearances so far in the League Cup, said: “Right now, if you want a trophy, and that’s something that we want, we have to fight against good teams. “Both semi-finals are big games, and it’s going to be tough, but we’ll prepare well for the game, and we’ll be ready and we’ll go for it.” Arsenal will take on Chelsea for a place at Wembley with the first of two legs to be played at Stamford Bridge on January 14 before the return match at the Emirates on February 3.The Gunners were on course to reach the semi-finals in regulation time before Marc Guehi’s late equaliser — the third time in Arsenal’s last five fixtures the Premier League leaders’ defence has been breached in or beyond the 90th minute. “We’ve conceded in a couple of games in the last minute so it’s something that we have to look at,” said Kepa, deputising for Arsenal first-choice keeper David Raya. The 31-year-old Spaniard added: “But we are in the next round and we’re happy. We made a huge effort. We should have scored a couple in the first half. We played so well. Then the second half was more like 50-50.” “Credit to the guys, they took amazing penalties. They kept us in the game, and they gave me an opportunity to make a save. “Emotionally, you have to be focused, be strong, because obviously when you concede in the last minute and then you have to go to penalties, you need to 100 percent be focused on your penalty takers, you need to save.

{"title": "US ambassador says Trump-Erdogan ties may resolve Turkey’s F-35 ban", "body": "The close relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is bringing the two countries closer to resolving Turkey’s exclusion from the F-35 fighter jet program, the U.S. ambassador to Ankara said Wednesday. Ambassador Tom Barrack, who also serves as Trump’s special envoy for Syria, said on social media that the “positive relationship” between the leaders has created a new atmosphere of cooperation, leading to the most productive discussions on the F-35 issue in nearly a decade. Turkey was removed from the F-35 program during Trump’s first term after purchasing the Russian-made S-400 air defense system, raising U.S. concerns that the missile system could compromise F-35 security. Ankara has sought readmission, noting its $1.4 billion investment before being suspended in 2019. The U.S. also imposed sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act in 2020. Barrack said discussions continue on Turkey’s desire to rejoin the program while maintaining its S-400 system, with hopes for a breakthrough in the coming months that would satisfy both U.S. security requirements and Turkish interests. While barred from F-35 deliveries, Turkey is strengthening its air force with Eurofighter Typhoons, U.S.-made F-16s, and developing its own KAAN fifth-generation fighter jet, expected in 2028. Trump and Erdogan, who met at the White House in September, have maintained a strong personal rapport. Previous U.S. administrations kept Turkey at a distance due to human rights concerns, ties with Russia, and tensions with regional allies.

{"title": "US conducts strikes near Venezuela, seizes oil tanker amid Trump’s drug war", "body": "The Trump administration has carried out a series of military operations near Venezuela over the past three months, including attacks on alleged drug-smuggling vessels and the seizure of an oil tanker, in what officials describe as an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. At least 99 people have been killed in 26 known strikes, while the U.S. has deployed its largest regional naval buildup in decades. President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned of potential land operations in Venezuela, and on Dec. 16 ordered a blockade of all “sanctioned oil tankers” entering or leaving the country. The administration alleges that Venezuela’s oil is being used to fund drug trafficking, terrorism, and other crimes, though Caracas denounces the actions as theft and international piracy. The military campaign began in September with the first strike on a suspected drug boat linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Subsequent attacks have taken place in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, often targeting vessels accused of smuggling narcotics. In addition to the strikes, the U.S. has sent guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships, fighter jets, and the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to the region, bringing total troop presence to around 12,000. Lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns over the legality and transparency of the operations. Democratic leaders have criticized the administration for not providing sufficient legal justification and called for congressional oversight, while the U.N. human rights chief urged an investigation into the strikes, warning against extrajudicial killings. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the U.S. actions, mobilizing troops and volunteers for military exercises and insisting that Washington’s operations aim to force him from power. Trump, however, has indicated willingness to engage in discussions with Maduro without specifying details. The campaign continues to draw scrutiny in Congress as lawmakers weigh potential limits on executive military authority, even as House Republicans rejected resolutions seeking to constrain the president’s use of force against drug cartels and Venezuela.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/us-conducts-strikes-near-venezuela-seizes-oil-tanker-amid-trumps-drug-war", "date": "2025-12-19T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 323},

{"title": "Hadi’s struggles to inspire future generations ENVIRON ADVISER", "body": "In a poignant tribute that resonates deeply across Bangladesh’s political and activist circles, Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan has mourned the untimely demise of Sharif Osman Hadi, hailing him as an indomitable warrior of the July uprising and the voice of the ‘Inquilab Mancha’. The adviser’s condolence message was released on Friday and she acknowledged Hadi’s fearless, unyielding resistance against oddness describing his passing as an irreplaceable loss to the nation. Hadi, who stood at the forefront of the mass revolution that reshaped the country’s destiny, leaves behind a legacy that promises to ignite the spirits of generations to come. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, serving as adviser to the ministries of Information and Broadcasting; Environment, Forests and Climate Change; and Water Resources, did not hold back in her admiration for Hadi’s role in the historic July movement. “Sharif Osman Hadi was a fearless voice and bold organizer of the July mass uprising,” she declared in her statement, her words carrying the weight of someone who has long championed justice and environmental causes. She recalled how Hadi’s unwavering stance against injustice, oppression, and suppression served as a beacon for democracy-loving people, transforming abstract ideals into a rallying cry that echoed through the streets and squares of Bangladesh. The adviser delved deeper into Hadi’s character, emphasizing the clarity, firmness, and sense of duty with which he articulated the movement’s demands. In an era marked by crackdowns and silencing of dissent, Hadi’s ability to present the language of resistance with such precision ensured its place in the annals of history. Hasan highlighted how his speeches and actions cut through the noise, mobilising the masses with a message that was both uncompromising and profoundly relatable. This was no mere participant in the protests; Hadi was a strategist, a communicator whose words galvanised thousands, turning individual grievances into a collective force for change. Reflecting on his broader impact, Rizwana Hasan underscored Hadi’s pivotal role in awakening the youth and building public opinion on critical issues of rights and justice. As the spokesperson for ‘Inquilab Mancha’, he bridged the gap between the streets and the national discourse, ensuring that the voices of the oppressed were not just heard but amplified. His contributions, she noted, are undeniable-forged in the crucible of real struggles, where every rally, every chant, and every confrontation added to his stature as a symbol of resilience. In a nation still healing from the wounds of authoritarianism, Hadi’s work in fostering awareness among the younger generation stands as a testament to his foresight and dedication.“Hadi’s struggling life, ideals, and courage will inspire future generations to stand firm against injustice,” she affirmed, evoking images of students, activists, and ordinary citizens drawing strength from his example. In a time when the July uprising’s heroes are being remembered as architects of a new Bangladesh, not just as a martyr of the moment, but as an eternal motivator. His life story marked by personal sacrifices, bold confrontations with powerful, unshakeable commitment to equity serves as boldness those who will carry the torch forward. Concluding her message with spiritual solace and empathy, the adviser prayed for the forgiveness of the departed soul and extended her deepest condolences to Hadi’s grieving family, comrades, and co-members.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/hadis-struggles-to-inspire-future-generations-environ-adviser", "date": "2025-12-20T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 534},

According to a statement from the US State Department, the two leaders discussed a new US-Palau Memorandum of Understanding regarding the transfer of third-country nationals with no known criminal histories. President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including a sweeping deportation drive, have drawn criticism from human rights advocates over concerns related to due process. The Trump administration has also sent hundreds of migrants to third countries with which they have no prior ties, a practice that was rarely used in the past. Trump has said the measures are intended to improve domestic security. In late July, Palau’s Congress said it “cannot accept” a US proposal to take in asylum seekers from other countries. Palau, which has a population of about 17,000, maintains a compact of free association with the United States. Under the arrangement, Washington provides economic assistance in return for military access to Palau’s territory. Palau is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention. US Catholic bishops have criticised Washington’s immigration enforcement actions, and in October Pope Leo XIV expressed concern over the mistreatment of immigrants.

{"title": "Ukraine sends US new plan to end the war as Trump blasts Europe", "body": "Ukraine has sent Washington an updated plan for ending Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian officials told AFP Wednesday, as US President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first US plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia’s hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it “takes into account Ukraine’s vision — it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues”. “We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side,” the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a US plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kyiv and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as “decaying” and “weak” on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new US national security strategy said the continent risked “civilisational erasure”. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words,” Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine’s European allies put on a show of support for Zelensky as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest US proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked “wasting time”. “I think we had some little disputes about people, and we’re going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump added. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”. – ‘Let people fight it out’ – Talks between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelensky, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader — who Trump has accused of not reading the plan — said on Tuesday the plan had been broken down into three documents — a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine’s post-war recovery. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky said he had held an online meeting with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine’s recovery. “This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Zelensky said on social media. “We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment,” he added. But US leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don’t,” Trump said on Wednesday. “But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you’re losing thousands of people a week. It’s ridiculous.

{"title": "NBR hints at possible extension of online tax return deadline", "body": "National Board of Revenue (NBR) Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan has indicated that the government may consider further extending the deadline for online income tax return submission, as a large number of registered taxpayers have yet to file their returns digitally. Speaking at the inauguration of an income tax return support booth at the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) on Sunday, Khan said the NBR would assess the need for an extension based on submission trends. “When we see that a large percentage of registered taxpayers have submitted their returns, we will understand that most of the work has been completed. At this stage, we believe around another 1.5 million taxpayers will submit their returns online,” he said. He added that any decision regarding an extension would be made after consulting the finance adviser. The DRU had requested an extension to assist its members in preparing and submitting their returns. “To ensure transparency, we have introduced a digital platform that allows taxpayers to submit their returns in a hassle-free manner,” Khan said. He added that audits would be conducted automatically using data generated through the digital system. Currently, a limited number of returns are still being accepted manually, but these will gradually be converted into digital records. The system is being continuously updated based on taxpayer feedback. Khan also announced plans to introduce digital VAT return submission next year and a mobile app to further simplify the process. The NBR is working to integrate data from Central Depository Bangladesh Limited (CDBL) and banks to automatically update information on capital market investments and interest income. Khan stressed that these details would only be visible to respective taxpayers, with no unauthorised access allowed. According to the chairman, around 4.2 million taxpayers have registered for online return submission, with over 2.6 million returns already filed. “This means around 1.5 to 1.6 million returns are still pending. Receiving all of them within the next week may be difficult, especially as new registrations continue every day. On average, more than 15,000 taxpayers register daily for e-return submission,” he said. The NBR had earlier extended the deadline for individual taxpayers by one month, allowing returns for the 2025-26 tax year to be filed until 31 December, instead of the original 30 November deadline. Currently, taxpayers can submit returns online without uploading any documents. Upon paying income tax through any banking channel or mobile financial service, they receive an automated e-return acknowledgement instantly. From the next fiscal year, savings-related information will be obtained directly from banks, and integration with CDBL and banking platforms will eliminate the need for taxpayers to collect certificates for dividends, interest income, or savings instruments. Khan emphasized that NBR officials will not have access to individual taxpayers’ personal financial data. The event was attended by DRU President Abu Saleh Akon, General Secretary Mainul Hasan Sohel, and Finance Secretary Niaz Mahmud Sohel.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/nbr-hints-at-possible-extension-of-online-tax-return-deadline", "date": "2025-12-22T00:08:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 476},

{"title": "CAB demands cancellation of power deals signed under immunity law", "body": "The Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB) has demanded the immediate cancellation of all electricity and energy sector investment and purchase agreements signed under the immunity law, alleging large-scale misuse of public funds and prolonged lack of accountability. The demand was made at a human chain organised by CAB Chattogram and Jubo CAB Chattogram at the Jamalkhan Press Club premises on Saturday morning. Speakers alleged that over the past 15 years, successive agreements signed under the Rapid Increase in Supply of Electricity and Energy (Special Provisions) Act enabled unreasonable benefits for a select group, resulting in the wastage of public funds and large sums of money being siphoned abroad in the name of capacity charges. They said the immunity provisions have prevented scrutiny of these contracts and shielded those responsible, creating a major barrier to good governance in the power and energy sector. The human chain was chaired by CAB central committee vice-president SM Nazer Hossain and led by Jubo CAB Chattogram coordinator Raisul Islam and CAB divisional organiser Russell Uddin. Several consumer rights activists, civil society members and journalists also spoke at the programme. In his address, SM Nazer Hossain said that despite recent initiatives by the interim government to regulate the electricity and energy sectors and cancel some unnecessary projects, the immunity law remains in place, allowing corruption over the past one and a half decades to go unaddressed. He alleged that state funds were looted through non-competitive contracts, contributing to repeated increases in electricity and fuel prices and raising production costs for industries, ultimately burdening consumers. He claimed that while power generation capacity increased fourfold, overall costs rose elevenfold, citing rental payments to private power plants without generation, inflated LNG import prices and opaque power purchase agreements. According to him, these practices facilitated the rise of a powerful energy syndicate protected under state policy. Speakers demanded the immediate cancellation of all contracts signed under the immunity law, public disclosure of those responsible for alleged irregularities, prosecution of the guilty, and recovery of misappropriated funds. They also called for a transparent, accountable and public interest-based energy policy. The speakers further noted that in the 2024-25 fiscal year, the electricity sector subsidy stands at Tk40,000 crore, while the proposed gas subsidy is Tk7,000 crore, claiming that the benefits largely accrue to vested interests rather than consumers. They also demanded the formation of an independent national commission, free from conflicts of interest, to review capacity charges, power purchase agreements (PPAs) and long-term service agreements (LTSAs) across all electricity and primary energy development projects.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/cab-demands-cancellation-of-power-deals-signed-under-immunity-law", "date": "2025-12-21T00:02:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 422},

The international tournament is being held at the Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Indoor Stadium in Paltan, Dhaka. While the men’s and women’s singles continued to tell a tale of early exits for the hosts, it was the men’s doubles players who restored pride on home soil. In particular, the pairs of Al-Amin Jumar and Moajzzem Hossain Ohidul, and Masud Ahmed and Sadakat Robin, produced inspired performances in the pre-quarter-finals to book their places in the quarter-finals. Jumar and Ohidul came through a gripping three-game contest against India’s Devart Mann and Saurabh Nain, winning 21-19, 17-21, 21-14. The match swung like a pendulum, with Bangladesh edging a tight first game before conceding the second. In the decider, they looked set for a comfortable win, only for Ohidul to suffer an injury mid-game. For a moment, it appeared the setback might derail the hosts, but Ohidul battled on despite limping, and the pair held their nerve to close out the match and spark celebrations in the stands. The Masud-Robin duo also showed great character. After losing the opening game 21-14 to Malaysia’s Lew Wen Ji and Jia Li Tan, they staged an impressive comeback, lifting their tempo and turning the match on its head to win the next two games 21-14 and 21-17. Their fighting spirit ensured a deserved place in Friday’s quarter-finals scheduled for Friday, 19 December. Jumar and Ohidul, who recently returned from an international tournament in Canada with a bronze medal, have been playing together for over a year and appear to be growing in confidence with every outing. Speaking after the match, they said they were delighted to reach the quarter-finals and were eager to go even further. The duo said, “We missed out on gold in Canada. At home, we want to aim for gold.” Masud and Robin, who hail from the Dinajpur Alora Shuttler Academy, were equally upbeat. They said, “We are very happy with this win. Just like today, we will step onto the court in the quarter-finals aiming to win.” Elsewhere, results did not go Bangladesh’s way. Mostafizur Rahman Lipton and Rafiul Raid were beaten 21-17, 21-17 by Vietnam’s Bui Danh and Nguyen Duc in men’s doubles.

In mixed doubles, Sifat Ullah and Brishti Khatun were beaten 21-13, 23-21, 21-17 by India’s Michael and Farja Nazrin.As the tournament moves into the quarter-final stage, attention will now centre on Jumar-Ohidul and Masud-Robin, who carry Bangladesh’s hopes of a deep run in this international event.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/jumar-ohidul-and-masud-robin-pairs-reach-quarter-finals", "date": "2025-12-19T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 500},

Her fluent performance as ‘Mehreen’ has impressed so much that the audience is now reluctant to see her in any other role. In a recent interview, Keya Payel spoke about her work experience and the unprecedented response from the audience. She said that the director of the play messaged her about the special interest of the audience. Payel said, “The director told me that audience has received me so positively as ‘Mehreen’ that they don’t want to see me in any other role right now. What greater achievement can there be for an actress than this?” Keya Payel has been working regularly in the drama arena for a long time.

She believes that there is always a demand for stories that can be watched with the whole family in the drawing room. Actor Mukit Zakaria has joined the team of this drama, and Keya Payel is very excited about him. She said, “The name ‘Mehreen’ is really beautiful. I like it when someone calls me by this name. But at the end of the day, even though I am ‘Mehreen’ on screen, in reality I am Keya Payel. I feel more comfortable thinking of myself this way. In my eyes, every person in the world is beautiful.

She made the remarks in a personal Facebook post in which she shared reflections on her family, roots and journey ahead of her return to Bangladesh. In the post, Zaima recalled her childhood memories with her grandmother, fondly calling her ‘Dadu’, and described Khaleda Zia as a caring and proud family figure despite carrying the responsibilities of leading the nation. “One of my most cherished memories of my Dadu captures her fiercely loving and loyal matriarchal role in our family. When I was around eleven, our high school team won a football tournament. My mother took me straight to Dadu’s office so that I could show her my medal and tell her about it myself. As I animatedly recounted my goalkeeping ‘heroics’, I was keenly aware of how attentive and proud she was. So much so that she would share that childhood story with others,” Zaima said. She wrote that while millions knew Khaleda Zia as the Prime Minister, to her and her cousins she was first a loving grandmother who always made time for her family and celebrated their small achievements. Zaima said those moments became her first lessons in leadership, humility, sincerity and the importance of listening to others. ‘Seventeen years away from Bangladesh have been transformative, but I never forgot to tend to and cultivate my roots. Why? Because we are shaped by what we anchor ourselves to our culture, community, and identity. Like many second and third generation Bangladeshis abroad, I have lived in more than one world. London grounded me and gave me a global perspective, but Bangladesh always remained my focus,” she said. Zaima also shared her experience of studying and practising law, saying that working closely with people taught her empathy, integrity and the importance of understanding others, especially those who feel unheard by the justice system. Tarique’s only daughter said she never met her grandfather and late President Ziaur Rahman but grew up learning about his integrity and patriotism, which she said had been carried forward by her grandmother and father. Referring to the mass uprising and the period following August 5, she said she mostly remained in the background, offering support where she could and trying to ease the burden on her family through small but meaningful actions. Expressing her feelings about returning home, Zaima said she wants to stand beside her grandmother and support her father during the current campaign period. “I hope to give back to my country in whatever ways I can. I want to see Bangladesh be rebuilt and thrive, as it should. I want to rediscover my homeland through my own eyes and lived experiences, to connect with people face to face, because that is the sincerest way to understand another’s perspective, just as I have been taught. Acknowledging public curiosity and expectations surrounding her family, Zaima said she feels that weight herself but sees it as part of her personal journey. “So, this is my journey, told in my own way,” she wrote, adding that if it resonates with others, she hopes they can walk that journey together. Zaima is scheduled to return to Bangladesh with her father Tarique Rahman on Thursday (December 25), ending their 17-year exile abroad, as they have been living in London since September 2008.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/zaima-pledges-to-engage-with-people-to-help-rebuild-bangladesh", "date": "2025-12-23T20:08:56+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 584},

{"title": "Job creation for youths prioritised Dr Shafiqur", "body": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Dr Shafiqur Rahman on Friday said his party would priorities employment generation for young people instead of providing unemployment allowances, stressing that youths should become active builders of the nation rather than recipients of stipends. “We do not want our youths to accept unemployment allowances from anyone. We want to turn every young hand into a hand that builds the country,” he told the central members’ conference of Islami Chhatrashibir as the chief guest at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre (BCFCC). Dr Shafiqur said Jamaat-e-Islami would work in unity with people of all classes to build a humane and discrimination-free Bangladesh. “We want to place work in every hand, strength in every heart and the message of revolution on the lips of our youths. Not unemployment allowance, but youths themselves will bring revolution in every sector of this country,” he added.Calling upon young people to prepare themselves, the Jamaat Ameer said, “You will succeed, Insha Allah. We are with you.” Highlighting the party’s vision for education, Dr Shafiqur said Jamaat wants to establish an education system that would help students become complete human beings, reach the highest standard of learning, develop strong moral character and acquire technical skills so that no young man or woman remains unemployed, reports BSS. Referring to Chhatrashibir’s recent victories in different student unions, he said the youths now carry the responsibility of 180 million people. “May Allah make this burden easier for you and grant you the strength to bear it. These victories indicate that the victory of justice will come to Bangladesh, Insha Allah,” he said. “Students voted for Chhatrashibir as a symbol of justice in educational institutions, not for any other reason,” he added. The Jamaat chief also said his party wants to establish justice in the country, noting that Bangladesh is currently facing an acute shortage of justice. “The foundation of justice is the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Justice has never been established anywhere in the world by abandoning the Quran and Sunnah,” he said. Dr Shafiqur reiterated Jamaat-e-Islami’s commitment to restoring peace and discipline in people’s lives in line with divine guidance and to building a corruption-free, discrimination-free and justice-based humane Bangladesh. The day-long conference is being attended by members from across the country.

{"title": "Gaza’s tech workers code from rubble", "body": "In a territory where 81 percent of buildings lie damaged or destroyed, a small community of young Palestinians is fighting to preserve what remains of Gaza’s digital world. Coders, repair technicians and freelance workers are labouring under impossible conditions to keep the besieged enclave connected to the outside world.Against all odds, Gaza’s youths continue to adapt. They work offline, code in notebooks, store solar power whenever the sun is out, and wait for rare moments of connectivity to send their work to clients around the world. In a war that has taken nearly everything, digital skills have become a form of survival – and resilience. Many now also rely on online work to make a living. But even that fragile lifeline is now hanging by a thread after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Israeli forces have “deliberately and systematically destroyed” the telecommunications infrastructure. “We just always look for another way to get connected, always find another way,” said Shaima Abu Al Atta, a coder working from a displacement camp. “This is what actually gave us purpose because if we didn’t do this, we would just die surviving and not doing anything. We would die internally.” Before the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza had a modest but vibrant tech scene. Innovation hubs hosted coding bootcamps, and hundreds of freelancers worked remotely for international clients. Much of that ecosystem now lies in ruins.Shareef Naim, an engineer who led a technology hub, described what was lost. His building housed more than 12 programmers with contracts for companies outside Gaza, he said. “The team was very active,” Naim told Al Jazeera. Today, the structure is destroyed, though some team members are still trying to work from tents and emergency shelters. Computer technician A’aed Shamaly says, “The main challenge is electricity. Today, electricity is not available all the time, and if it is available, it is unstable, and there will be a lot of cuts. Prices are also high.” Electricity, when available at all, is unstable and prohibitively expensive, $12 per kilowatt compared with $1.50 for 10 kilowatts before the war, he said. “There are no spare parts,” he added, so technicians must scavenge components from broken equipment pulled from bombed buildings. The scale of destruction is staggering. According to the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT), approximately 198,273 structures across Gaza have been damaged, with 123,464 completely destroyed. The telecommunications sector has been particularly hard hit. Data from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics reveals that 64 percent of mobile phone towers were out of service as of early April 2025. In Rafah, coverage has collapsed to just 27 percent, down from near-universal access before the war. During the war, connectivity watchdog NetBlocks documented repeated disruptions, including what it called a “near-total telecoms blackout” in January 2024 that lasted for days. Israel has long restricted Gaza to outdated 2G mobile technology while allowing 4G in the occupied West Bank. The telecommunications sector’s value has cratered from $13m in 2023 to just $1.5m in 2024, an 89 percent collapse. Estimated losses exceed half a billion dollars, while reconstruction is projected to cost at least $90m.The consequences ripple across Gaza’s economy and society. Remote work was a crucial income source in a territory where unemployment exceeded 79 percent even before October 2023. Now, erratic internet access has pushed many freelancers into joblessness just as Israeli-induced famine has sent food prices soaring. The telecommunications collapse has also paralysed the banking system, preventing money transfers and leaving families unable to access cash. Healthcare has been disrupted, with the World Health Organization documenting deaths caused by the inability to contact emergency services in time. Even during the fragile ceasefire that took effect in October 2025, Israel has blocked essential repair equipment from entering Gaza. The restrictions form part of what analysts describe as a deliberate strategy to maintain control over Palestinian digital infrastructure and suppress the flow of information to the outside world. The future remains deeply uncertain, as efforts to push a fragile ceasefire forward appear to stall and Israel threatens the possibility of returning to full-scale war.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/gazas-tech-workers-code-from-rubble", "date": "2025-12-20T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 691},

{"title": "12 killed in shooting at Australia’s Bondi Beach", "body": "At least 12 people were killed and almost 30 wounded when gunmen fired on a Jewish holiday event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday in what Australian police and officials described as a terrorist attack. One suspected gunman was killed and another was in a critical condition, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference. At least 29 people injured, including two police officers, were taken to hospital, he said. Police were investigating whether a third gunman was involved in the shooting, and a bomb-disposal unit was working on several suspected improvised explosive devices, Lanyon said. Mike Burgess, a top Australian intelligence official, said one of the suspected attackers was known to authorities but had not been deemed an immediate threat. Sunday’s shootings were the most serious of a string of antisemitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023. Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst such incident in the country since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at a tourist site in the southern state of Tasmania. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese convened a meeting of the country’s national security council and condemned the attack, saying the evil that was unleashed was “beyond comprehension”. “This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” he said. “At this dark moment for our nation, our police and security agencies are working to determine anyone associated with this outrage.” Witnesses said the shooting at the famed beach on a hot summer’s evening lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets and parks. Police said around 1,000 people had attended the Hanukkah event alone. “I was just getting ready to go home, and, like, I was packing my bag, got my flip-flops, was ready to catch my bus, and then I started hearing the shots,” said Bondi Junction resident Marcos Carvalho, 38. “We all panicked and started running as well. So we left everything behind, like flip-flops, everything. We just ran through the hill,” he said. “I must have heard, I don’t know, maybe, like, 40, 50 shots.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting and that Australia’s government must “come to its senses” after countless warnings. “These are the results of the antisemitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the antisemitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today.”One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists. “If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.Bondi resident Grace Mathew said she saw people running past her and heard gunshots. “Initially you just think, it’s a beautiful day down by the beach,” she said. “You sort of think that people are just having a good time. Then more people ran past and said there’s a shooter, there’s a mass shooting and they’re killing people.” “These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society. Those responsible must be held fully accountable and face the full force of the law,” the Australian National Imams Council, the Council of Imams NSW and the Australian Muslim community said in a statement. “Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all those who witnessed or were affected by this deeply traumatic attack.” Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard. One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled the weapon off him. Another man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge. Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters confirmed the videos from verified corroborating footage showing the same men. The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff. “Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” said Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal Party.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/12-killed-in-shooting-at-australias-bondi-beach", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 833},
{"title": "6 killed in 2 water vessels accidents", "body": "At least six passengers were killed and 15 others injured when water vessels collided in Chandpur and Narayanganj districts amid dense fog on Friday. One of the collisions occurred around 2am in the Nilkamal Bangla Bazar area of Haimchar upazila in Chandpur, along the Meghna River’s boundary waters, confirmed Chandpur River Police Officer-in-Charge (OC) ASM Iqbal and Sadarghat River Police In-charge Sohag Rana. The deceased, all passengers of the launch MV Zakir Samrat-3, were identified as Abdul Gani, 38, from Kajirabad village in Lalmohan upazila of Bhola; Md Saju, 45, from the same village; Rina, 35, from Kachukhali Gojaria village; and Md Hanif, 60, from Ahmedpur village in Charfession upazila. Chandpur region River Police Assistant Superintendent Imtiaz Ahmed said the death toll currently stands at four. He added that Shipping Adviser Brigadier General (retd) M Sakhawat Hossain was scheduled to visit Sadarghat to inspect the damaged launch involved in the accident. OC ASM Iqbal said river police reached the scene around 2:45am but found no launches at the site as both vessels had already left the area. However, the Barishal-bound launch MV Adventure-9 was seized later in the morning at Jhalakathi while travelling from Barishal. Passengers said MV Zakir Samrat-3, which departed from Ghosherhat in Bhola for Dhaka, was crossing the Haimchar river zone shortly after 2am. At the same time, MV Adventure-9, carrying passengers returning to Barishal from a BNP conference in Dhaka, was travelling in the opposite direction. Due to extremely poor visibility caused by dense fog across the river, Adventure-9 reportedly lost its bearings and rammed Zakir Samrat-3 at high speed. Passengers further said Zakir Samrat-3 was left severely damaged and began sinking mid-river. Another Dhaka-bound launch, MV Karnaphuli-9, arrived from Bhola and rescued many passengers before continuing towards the capital. In another incident caused by dense fog, two people were killed as a passenger launch collided with a sand-laden bulkhead anchored in the Dharmaganj area of Fatullah, Narayanganj, around 6am today. The bulkhead, identified as MB Kasfa Shahana, sank immediately after being hit by the Dhaka-bound launch Sundarban-16.Relatives initially reported that two staff members of the bulkhead went missing. Narayanganj Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer SM Faiz Uddin later confirmed that divers have recovered the bodies of the missing individuals — Zahirul Islam Shakil, 25, from Patuakhali, and Md Hasan, 20, from Jhalakathi.According to police, the launch struck the bulkhead while it was anchored in front of a dockyard. Of the five staff members on board the bulkhead, three managed to jump into the water and save their lives, while the remaining two were feared trapped inside.Additional DIG of River Police Alamgir Hossain confirmed the accident occurred due to heavy fog and said the launch involved has been detained.BIWTA Joint Director Mahmud-Al-Hasan said, “We are attempting to reach the cabin where the two missing staff were reportedly sleeping. However, the rescue operation is being significantly hampered by the intense cold.”Divers from both the Coast Guard and Fire Service are continuing the search operation.Meanwhile, an eight member panel has been formed to investigate the head-on collision between two launches in the Meghna River in Harina of Chandpur district, leaving four dead and several others injured.The Ministry of Shipping formed the probe body headed by its Additional Secretary Md.

{"title": "Loan defaults, weak governance expose banking vulnerabilities this year", "body": "Bangladesh’s banking sector ended 2025 facing one of the most severe crises in decades. Years of political interference, irregular lending, and weak regulatory oversight had left many banks in poor health, but the scale of the problem became clear this year. By September, non-performing loans (NPLs) had reached Tk 6.44 lakh crore, nearly 36 percent of total credit the highest since 2000. Over a dozen banks reported default ratios above 50 percent. Large corporate groups, particularly after the government change in August 2024, caused most of these new defaults. The broader economy added to the pressure. Inflation remained high at 8 percent. Private sector credit growth slowed to record lows, and lending rates climbed to 16–17 per cent, discouraging investment. Businesses held back expansion, while depositors worried about their savings. The interim government acted with bold steps. Five troubled shariah-based banks merged into the state-owned Sammilito Islami Bank PLC, creating the country’s largest Islamic lender with Tk 35,000 crore in capital, including Tk 20,000 crore from the government. Four banks were linked to the S Alam Group, while EXIM Bank was controlled by the Nassa Group. Shareholders lost their investments, but depositors were reassured. Nine troubled non-bank financial institutions were also shut down. The Bank Resolution Ordinance 2025 gave authorities the power to intervene in failing banks, while the Deposit Protection Ordinance doubled insured deposits to Tk 2 lakh, covering 93 percent of depositors. These moves were seen as necessary to restore confidence, though they cannot solve underlying governance problems alone. Governance reforms faced obstacles. Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur sought to reduce political influence and strengthen autonomy, but bureaucracy slowed progress. Asset reviews, updated loan rules, and preparations for risk-based supervision continued quietly, with full implementation scheduled for January 2026. Draft amendments to the Bank Company Act, meant to tighten rules for bank owners and directors, were left for the next elected government.There were some positives in the external sector. Crackdowns on illegal money transfers helped stabilize the foreign exchange market. Remittances hit a record $30.04 billion, boosting reserves to $32.57 billion. Technology also began entering banking, with AI services and digital bank license applications, though these offered little immediate relief. The crisis exposed systemic weaknesses. Political interference and concentrated ownership had eroded depositor confidence. Yet it also forced action: weak banks were merged or closed, and the first steps toward risk-based supervision were taken. As Bangladesh enters 2026, the sector remains fragile. 2025 was a reckoning, not a recovery. The next government’s political will, along with continued reform, stronger supervision, and improved corporate governance, will determine whether the banking system can finally become stable, resilient, and capable of supporting sustainable economic growth and broader financial inclusion for all citizens.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/loan-defaults-weak-governance-expose-banking-vulnerabilities-this-year", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 452},
{"title": "Arsenal to go 5 points clear", "body": "Mohamed Salah played a key role in Liverpool’s vital win against Brighton on Saturday after an explosive interview raised questions over his future at the club as Arsenal avoided a major embarrassment against Wolves. The Egypt forward, the subject of intense scrutiny in the build-up to the game at Anfield, came off the substitutes’ bench to huge cheers in the first half, replacing injured defender Joe Gomez. The home team, whose Premier League title defence has collapsed after a shocking run of results, were leading 1-0 at the time, with France forward Hugo Ekitike on the scoresheet after just 46 seconds. Brighton squandered a number of opportunities to level and Ekitike scored his second with half an hour to go, heading home Salah’s corner. The Egyptian superstar now has 277 goal involvements for Liverpool in the Premier League — 188 goals and 89 assists — a new record by a player for a single club in the competition, overtaking Wayne Rooney’s mark for Manchester United. Saturday marked a dramatic change of mood around Salah, who last week accused Liverpool of throwing him “under the bus” after he was left on the bench for the 3-3 draw at Leeds.That was the third match in a row that he had been named among the replacements. The 33-year-old winger also said he had no relationship with manager Arne Slot in his extraordinary outburst and was omitted from the midweek Champions League trip to Inter Milan, which Liverpool won 1-0. After Saturday’s win Slot said there was “no issue to resolve” with Salah, though uncertainty remains over his long-term future at the club. “For me he’s now the same as any other player,” said the Dutchman. “You talk to your players if you’re happy or unhappy with things, but there’s nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds, after the game.” He added: “I spoke to him yesterday and I think, as I usually never say anything about (what) we talk about, I’m not going to make an exception now, but I think actions speak louder than what has been said. “He was in the squad again and when I had to make my first substitutions, I brought him in. And he performed as I think every fan, including me, would like him to perform today.”Salah will now depart for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco and could potentially be absent for five weeks. The 2-0 win — Liverpool’s first at Anfield since November 4 — lifts Slot’s men to sixth in the table.But their title defence is in ruins after a terrible run of just two wins in 10 league matches before the visit of Brighton.– Arsenal late show –The Reds are 10 points behind leaders Arsenal, who narrowly avoided dropping vital points against bottom side Wolves in Saturday’s late kick-off, courtesy of two own goals in a 2-1 win.Arsenal had huffed and puffed for 70 minutes before the ball rebounded off Wolves goalkeeper Sam Johnstone and into his own net.Astonishingly, Wolves pulled level in the 90th minute but just as the home fans contemplated a damaging draw, the Gunners benefited from a second own goal when Bukayo Saka’s cross was diverted into his own net by Wolves defender Yerson Mosquera in the 94th minute.Earlier, Cole Palmer, whose season has been badly disrupted by a groin injury, scored his first goal since September, as Chelsea beat Everton 2-0 to move back into the top four.But after the match manager Enzo Maresca made startling comments, saying he had suffered his “worst 48 hours” since joining the club in July 2024.The Italian hit out at unnamed parties for failing to support him and his players, though he stressed that he was not referring to fans.“The last 48 hours has been the worst since I joined the club because many people didn’t support me and the team,” he said. “In general.”Asked whether he was talking about the club’s supporters, he added: “I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans.”On Friday he had said that only victories would stop supporters from complaining on social media and reflected on his 30 years in football, saying: “I know that if you don’t win everyone complains.”Fulham beat relegation-threatened Burnley 3-2.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/arsenal-to-go-5-points-clear", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 708},
{"title": "‘President Zia was rare patriot, nation-builder’", "body": "BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Monday said BNP founder Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman was a rare patriotic leader and a true nation-builder. “Ziaur Rahman dedicated his entire life to the country and its people. In a very short span of time, he made remarkable contributions to agriculture, industry, the economy, literature, and culture,” Fakhrul said while speaking as the chief guest at a publication ceremony organised by the Press Institute of Bangladesh (PIB). The programme highlighted Ziaur Rahman’s foreign and development policies and his role regarding the Farakka Barrage. Fakhrul said Ziaur Rahman’s first cabinet was widely known as a “Galaxy of Intellectuals,” as it included some of the country’s finest minds. “This was possible because he believed in running the state with competent, knowledgeable, and expert individuals,” he added. The BNP Secretary General said Shaheed President Zia revived a war-ravaged economy and transformed it into a potentially prosperous one. “His vision of maintaining balanced diplomatic relations with the Western world, China, India, and Russia was also exceptional,” he noted.Referring to the 1979 parliamentary election, Fakhrul said the parliament at that time included representatives from diverse political opinions and ideologies, setting an example of a consensus-based and intellectually strong legislature. “Ziaur Rahman was a natural leader whose honesty and discipline were legendary. He was uncompromising against corruption and nepotism. His simple lifestyle, personal integrity, and direct connection with the people inspired the nation,” Fakhrul said.He alleged that those who opposed the existence of Bangladesh were responsible for the assassination of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman and claimed that the same forces are still conspiring to destroy new national prospects. Fakhrul stressed that Ziaur Rahman’s philosophy of nationalism remains the core foundation of Bangladesh and urged the nation to move forward by embracing it.Calling on people not to lose hope, he said moving ahead with dignity and confidence would be the greatest tribute to Ziaur Rahman.Economist Prof Mahbub Ullah presided over the event, while PIB Director General, journalist and author Faruk Wasif moderated it. BNP Acting Chairman’s Adviser Mahdi Amin and BRAIN Executive Director Dr Shafiqur Rahman also spoke.Prof Mahbub Ullah said Ziaur Rahman made outstanding contributions to statecraft and nation-building. “It is uncertain whether such an exceptional thinker will be born again in this country. His untimely death was an immeasurable loss,” he remarked.On national institutions, he said problems arise when they are used for personal or partisan interests. “At that point, nation-building gives way to party interests. Ziaur Rahman always opposed this and prioritised competence and honesty regardless of political affiliation,” he added.Meanwhile, Mirza Fakhrul also spoke at a separate programme jointly organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB).At the event, the BNP Secretary General said he never wanted a country where media houses come under attack.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/president-zia-was-rare-patriot-nation-builder", "date": "2025-12-23T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 466},

Processions from different parts of the city arrived in succession and eventually converged at the busy intersection to press their demand for justice over his killing. During the demonstration, protesters raised slogans including “Delhi or Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka,” “Modi or Hadi? Hadi, Hadi,” “We want justice,” and “Catch Awami League, put them behind bars.” The protesters began dispersing around 5:15pm, after which traffic gradually resumed on the Shahbagh-Matsya Bhaban, Shahbagh-Karwan Bazar, and Shahbagh-Science Lab roads, which had remained blocked during the protest. Some demonstrators were also seen hurling shoes at an effigy bearing the photograph of Law Adviser Asif Nazrul during the rally. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Inqilab Mancha and secretary of the Liberation War and Democratic Movement of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, called on people to join the protest. “Everyone come to Shahbagh,” she wrote in a Facebook post following Hadi’s funeral.

Referring to recent incidents, he said the entire nation witnessed the attack on Osman Hadi, but those involved in the attempted killing have yet to be arrested. He demanded the immediate arrest of the attackers and their prosecution. “Those involved in planning and organising these attacks—whether within the administration or inside and outside the government—must be identified and brought to book,” he said. Calling for unity, the NCP convener said political parties are blaming each other over the incidents, but this is not the time for division. “If we remain divided, fascist forces will benefit the most,” he said, urging the maintenance of a minimum level of national unity to preserve a congenial environment for a free and fair election and to continue the democratic journey. Nahid also reflected on Martyred Intellectuals Day, recalling that on the eve of victory in the 1971 Liberation War, pro-liberation writers, artists, journalists and professionals were systematically killed to prevent Bangladesh from emerging as a dignified nation. He said that over the past 54 years, the struggle to realise the aspirations of the Liberation War has continued, requiring renewed sacrifice during the 2024 uprising. He alleged that in different phases of Bangladesh’s political history, a section of intellectuals stood with the people, while another aligned against them. “Even after August 5, we saw attempts in the name of intellectualism to create consent against July and in favour of repression,” he said, adding that people-oriented intellectuals have always existed and will continue to speak out. “The struggle for freedom of thought and cultural freedom is inseparable from political freedom,” Nahid said, adding that remembering the martyred intellectuals with respect also means upholding their aspirations. He expressed hope that politicians and intellectuals of the present time should carry forward the spirit of the historic struggles of 1947, 1971 and 2024 to build Bangladesh as a self-respecting state. Reiterating his demands, Nahid called for the swift arrest and trial of the attackers and for identifying all masterminds behind the attack, while maintaining a united anti-fascist front.

Three West Indian bowlers took two wickets each, Justin Greaves the pick with 2-83 from 29 overs, while Jayden Seales had 2-100 and Anderson Phillip 2-154.The declaration left New Zealand’s attack with 23 overs to bowl at the West Indies top order before the close in fading light. Seamer Kemar Roach was also a doubt to bat due to a pulled hamstring.The battered West Indian bowling corps did show some fight after lunch, led by a sharp and accurate spell from Seales. He trapped Conway lbw to make it 432-4 and the West Indies removed two more batsmen as New Zealand went to tea at 508-6. Glenn Phillips lost his battle with Phillip after tea, edging to first slip, and Zak Foulkes was bowled by a peach of a ball clipping the top of off stump. New Zealand had resumed after lunch at 424-3 at lunch, looking to punish an under-strength West Indian attack missing Roach. The tourists did not help themselves in the field. Kavem Hodge dropped Conway when he was on 206, and Daryl Mitchell was shelled by Greaves at second slip when he was on nine.

{"title": "Parents in India devastated as children with thalassemia test HIV positive", "body": "Parents of children with thalassemia in India say they are devastated after life-saving blood transfusions left their children HIV-positive, confronting them with illness, social stigma, and uncertainty. Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that requires regular transfusions to manage severe anaemia and sustain life. On Wednesday, authorities in central state of Madhya Pradesh said five children with thalassemia, aged three to 15, have tested positive for HIV, prompting concerns over blood transfusion practices. A committee has been set up to investigate the cases. The families are from Satna district. Although the infections were detected during routine screening between January and May 2025, they drew wider attention after local media reports earlier this week. The cases follow a similar incident in the eastern state of Jharkhand weeks earlier, where five children with thalassemia, all under eight, were found to have contracted HIV after blood transfusions at a state-run hospital. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, spreads through unprotected sex, unsafe medical practices, infected blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. While no longer a death sentence, it requires lifelong management. In India, more than 2.5 million people live with HIV, with about 66,400 new infections each year. Over 1.6 million are on lifelong treatment at antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres, government data shows. Satna district collector Satish Kumar S said the five children had received blood transfusions at different locations, involving multiple donors. Health officials said these included government hospitals and private clinics, and that all the children are now receiving treatment. In one case, officials said both parents of a three-year-old were HIV positive. In the other cases, the parents tested negative, ruling out mother-to-child transmission. Satna’s chief medical and health officer Manoj Shukla said children with multiple transfusions are considered high-risk and are routinely screened for HIV. “Once detected, treatment was started immediately and is continuing. At present, the children are stable,” he said. Every unit of blood issued by the district hospital’s blood bank is tested according to government protocol and released only after a negative report, Dr Shukla says. However, in rare cases, blood donors who are in the early stages of HIV infection may go undetected during initial screenings but test positive later, he adds.Cases of thalassemia patients contracting HIV during treatment are not new in India. In October, after similar incidents in Jharkhand, authorities suspended a lab assistant, the doctor in charge of the HIV unit and the chief surgeon of the state-run hospital involved. Chief Minister Hemant Soren also announced an assistance of 200,000 rupees ($2,212; £1,655) for each affected family. In 2011, authorities in Gujarat launched an investigation after 23 children with thalassemia tested positive for HIV following regular blood transfusions at a public hospital. Last week, thalassemia patients urged India’s parliament to pass the National Blood Transfusion Bill 2025, saying it would strengthen regulation of blood collection, testing and transfusion. Campaigners, including patients who contracted HIV through unsafe transfusions, called the bill a long-awaited step towards safer, quality-assured blood for those reliant on frequent transfusions.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/parents-in-india-devastated-as-children-with-thalassemia-test-hiv-positive", "date": "2025-12-20T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 506},

{"title": "Australia’s Tobacco tax and regulatory missteps hold warnings for Bangladesh", "body": "Bangladesh’s Interim Government risks forfeiting substantial government revenueand instead triggering acceleration of the illicit tobacco market if it proceeds with its proposed draconian tobacco control measures. Plans to ban ingredients, mandate retailer licenses, and alternative smokeless nicotine products such as vapour and nicotine pouches, coupled withdrastic excise increases above WHO target rates as seen in January 2025, do not necessarily translate into a reduction in tobacco consumption as seen in other countries, but instead threaten to fuelillicit trade for cigarettes. Tobacco taxes currently contribute roughly 10% of Bangladesh’s entire government revenue, making the tobacco sector one of the biggest fiscal contributors of the country.With financial pressures intensifying and enforcement resources stretched thin, the government has little room for error. Bangladesh’s currenttobacco tax rate stands at 83% of the retail price for the whole market, which exceeds the World Health Organization’s recommended benchmark of 75%. While the tobacco sector in Bangladesh had traditionally delivered an annual government revenue growth of 12-15% in the past, excluding the year impacted by Covid, early signs [afterthe unexpected excise hike was implemented]showed thatthis year’s tobacco revenue has witnessed a growth of mere 5%. Australia’s recent experience highlights how quickly tough tobacco regulations can disrupt the industry, driving rapid changes in both market dynamics and consumer behavior. Over the past decade, Australia has paired some of the world’s highest excise taxes—now at AUD 1.5 per cigarette—with strict controls such as flavor bans and a de facto ban on retail vapor sales. These aggressive measures have produced striking and far-reaching consequences for the industry, with results that have been truly alarming. Revenue collapsed. Tobacco excise revenue peaked at AUD 16.3 billion in 2019–20, before falling to AUD 7.8 billion in 2024-25, a loss of nearly AUD 9 billion. Independent economist Chris Richardson estimates the true annual loss may be closer to AUD 10 billion, arguing the scale of decline far exceeds what could plausibly be explained by quitting alone. Illicit markets surged. Official data from the Australian Illicit Tobacco and E-cigarette Commissioner estimates that 50–60% of all tobacco consumption is now illicit. In vapour, 95% of the total market is illicit and operates outside regulatory and health controls. Criminal networks are estimated to earn AUD 5.7–8.5 billion a year from illicit tobacco and vapes combined, while evaded excise and customs duty range from AUD 7.7–11.8 billion annually. Public health gains proved uneven. After Australia banned non-therapeutic vapes in July 2024, overall nicotine use rose for the first time in years . Survey data show the increase was driven mainly by factory-made cigarettes, primarily driven by increased smoking rateamong 18–24-year-olds. Australia is a G20 and OECD country with strong regulatory institutions and, as an island, has robust border controls. Yet even there, authorities have struggled to regain control of the tobacco and vapourmarket. For Bangladesh, the risks are magnified. We cannot afford to misstep with poorly thought-outregulations which will only drive an already growing illicit market and reduce government revenue. The former Head of the Australian Border Force’s Illicit Tobacco Strike Team, Rohan Pike who also led Australia’s law enforcement efforts in Pakistan and 12 neighbouring countries for 3 years stated“Australian tobacco control policies should serve as a cautionary tale for Bangladesh and other countries considering tobacco tax rises and additional regulation. Excessive excise hikes have reduced government revenue to less than half in just 6 years and driven an exploding black market that now makes up about two-thirds of the tobacco market. Bans on flavoured cigarettes have only accelerated the shift over to the black market and virtual bans on vapes and other nicotine products have made the far more dangerous, cheap, illegal cigarettes increasingly popular, reversing decades of smoking rate reductions. The Bangladesh government cannot afford to make the same mistakes as Australia.” A leading Bangladeshi expert in public finance has cautioned that adopting similar policies could lead to severe and unintended consequences. “Bangladesh relies more heavily on tobacco revenue than Australia, but has far fewer enforcement tools,” said Farid Uddin, former NBR Member. “If regulation moves faster than capacity and becomes impossible to implement and enforce, the state risks losing revenue, credibility, and control of the market at the same time.

They expressed hope that the upcoming election would be held in a free and fair manner under his leadership. In his address, Archbishop Bejoy N D’Cruze described Jesus Christ as universal and said that, inspired by the great ideals of forgiveness and service to humanity preached by Jesus Christ, millions of people around the world, including those in Bangladesh, are celebrating Christmas this year with joy and enthusiasm. Extending Christmas greetings to the Chief Adviser, N D’Cruze said, “After the July mass uprising, the people have keep their trust on you to rebuild Bangladesh anew. You have been carrying out that responsibility with great dedication. We pray that your efforts will succeed through a beautiful and peaceful election”. Wishing everyone on the occasion of the Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, Prof Yunus said, “You are the reflection of society. By looking at you, we can understand whether everything is in order.” “We want to build a healthy society. For that reason the July Charter has been prepared to uphold the spirit of the mass uprising,” the Chief Adviser said, adding, through a referendum on this charter, the country will move one step forward.

The Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane experienced technical failure while attempting to land Tuesday in the Osman Digna Air Base in the coastal city of Port Sudan, two officials said Wednesday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to brief the media, did not disclose how many personnel were on board. Among the dead was military pilot Omran Mirghani, according to his uncle, prominent Sudanese journalist Osman Mirghani, who mourned his nephew’s death on social media. The military didn’t comment on the crash.Plane crashes are not uncommon in Sudan, which has a poor aviation safety record. In February, at least 46 people, including women and children, were killed when a military aircraft crashed in a densely populated area in Omdurman, the sister city of the capital, Khartoum. The crash came as the miliary has suffered multiple setbacks in its war against a notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The miliary lost el-Fasher, its last stronghold in the sprawling region of Darfur in October, and earlier this week was forced to pull out from the country’s largest oil processing facility in the central region of Kordofan. The RSF has been accused of committing atrocities in el-Fasher including summary executions, rape and other crimes, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said Wednesday that war crimes and “potentially” crimes against humanity were committed in the city, which the RSF seized in late October. “We are talking about very serious atrocity crimes … war crimes for sure (and) potentially also crimes against humanity,” he told journalists in Geneva. “We have an extremely serious situation.” Türk warned atrocities also could happen in the central region of Kordofan where the RSF has intensified its attacks in recent months. “We cannot allow a repeat of this absolutely horrific situation in Kordofan,” he said, calling for a ceasefire in the country. The war in Sudan began in April 2023 over a power struggle between the miliary and the RSF. The conflict has killed over 40,000 people, a figure rights groups consider a significant undercount. The fighting has wrecked urban areas and has been marked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings, that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. The war has also created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/sudanese-military-plane-crashes-and-kills-all-crew-members-in-port-sudan", "date": "2025-12-11T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 448},

The programme began at 9:00am and was organised in line with this year’s theme, “Fostering a disability-inclusive society for advancing social progress.” The event brought together policymakers, rights activists, development practitioners and persons with disabilities (PWDs) to reflect on progress and chart a clearer path forward. Dr Md Omar Faruk, Rector of the Bangladesh Civil Services Academy under the Ministry of Public Administration, attended as chief guest. In his address, he pledged his full support for achieving BERDO’s mission and goals. He said initiatives such as the proposed BERDO Eye Hospital and a modern Braille press would play a vital role in expanding education opportunities for blind and visually impaired children across Bangladesh. A wide range of participants, including distinguished guests, journalists, BERDO officials and staff, as well as students from the BERDO Blind School, attended the programme, highlighting broad-based support for disability rights and inclusion. The workshop featured a keynote presentation by Feroza Khatun, Deputy Manager of BERDO, who placed strong emphasis on political participation, institutional reform and economic security for PWDs. Her paper outlined a set of policy recommendations, including reserving seats for persons with disabilities in the Jatiya Sangsad, prioritising PWDs in political party nominations, and forming a separate Ministry for Disability Development and Empowerment. She also called for appointing competent persons with disabilities as minister or state minister, creating a dedicated secretary post for disability affairs, establishing a national commission to strengthen enforcement of the Rights and Protection of Persons with Disabilities Act 2013, and making accessibility mandatory across all government agencies. Other recommendations included ensuring PWD representation in decision-making committees, setting up focal wings in ministries, increasing monthly disability allowances to Tk 5,000, and boosting budgetary allocations to fully implement existing laws. Md Saidul Huq, Executive Director of BERDO, highlighted the organisation’s activities and achievements, stressing its long-standing role in education, rehabilitation and advocacy for persons with disabilities. The session began with a welcome speech by Ms Hose Ara Begum, Treasurer of BERDO. The meeting was presided over by Advocate Mossarf Hossain Mazumder, Chairperson of BERDO, who emphasised the broader importance of the observance. “All of us must come forward to safeguard the rights, safety and development of persons with disabilities,” he said. He added that such programmes help raise public awareness, strengthen the confidence of PWDs, and remind society of its responsibility to ensure equal opportunities and full participation of persons with disabilities in national development.

The EPA will be signed next month,” he said at a press conference on Bangladesh-Japan EPA negotiations at the Secretariat. Bangladesh will enjoy immediate duty-free access to the Japanese market for 7,379 products once the Bangladesh-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is signed, marking a major boost for the country’s export sector. Japan will also enjoy duty-free access for 1,039 products under the agreement. The announcement was made by Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashir Uddin following a telephone conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu, during which the successful conclusion of the EPA negotiations was confirmed. According to a statement issued by the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing on Monday:Key highlights of the agreement is the inclusion of Bangladesh’s major export items particularly readymade garments (RMG) which will receive duty-free access to the Japanese market from the very first day the EPA comes into effect. The EPA also includes strong commitments in the Trade in Services sector. Under the deal, Bangladesh has agreed to open 97 sub-sectors to Japan, while Japan will open 120 sub-sectors to Bangladesh across four modes of supply. Officials believe this will encourage greater Japanese investment in Bangladesh, alongside enhanced technology transfer, skills development and service-sector collaboration. Japan is currently the world’s fourth-largest economy, and the conclusion of the EPA negotiations at the negotiator level marks a major milestone in bilateral economic relations. Legal scrubbing and final approvals are still pending before the agreement is officially signed. The government expects the EPA to deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for Bangladesh, including expanded trade, increased foreign direct investment, and new employment opportunities. Officials described the agreement as the beginning of a new chapter in Bangladesh-Japan economic cooperation.

Centered on the imaginary female character created by poet Jibanananda Das, the film has been directed by Masud Hasan Ujjal. Although the movie was initially scheduled for release last year, the decision was postponed due to the circumstances at the time. Finally, the government-grant-funded film is set to hit theaters this Eid-ul-Fitr. Masuma Rahman Nabila plays the titular role in the film. However, becoming Bonolata Sen was not easy for her. It is known that she was initially offered a different character, but Nabila declined the proposal. She clearly informed the director that she wanted to play the character of Bonolata Sen. Subsequently, she proved her suitability for the role through three rounds of challenging auditions and ultimately secured the character. In Bonolata Sen, Khairul Basar portrays the role of Jibanananda Das. Other cast members include SohelMondol, Najiba Bashar, Priyonti Urbi, Ruponti Akid, Sharif Siraj, Sumaiya Khushi, among others. The film received a government grant of BDT 7 million in the 2021-22 fiscal year. The director stated that no effort was spared in making the film. Although it took more time, the work was completed with great care. Masud Hasan Ujjal said, “Working on Jibanananda Das carries a great sense of responsibility.

{"title": "Gold, goldilocks and the dollar bears", "body": "Global financial markets delivered a rollercoaster ride in 2025, defying many predictions and underscoring the seismic impact of US President Donald Trump’s return to power. While world stocks rebounded from April’s “Liberation Day” tariffs crash, rising nearly 20 percent in their sixth year of double-digit gains over the last seven, other markets experienced dramatic, often unexpected moves. Gold, traditionally a safe haven, is on track for its strongest year since 1979, surging nearly 70 percent, with silver and platinum outperforming even more, rising about 130 percent. Meanwhile, the US dollar lost nearly 10 percent, the euro rose 14 percent, the Swiss franc and Swedish krona gained 14.5 percent and 19 percent respectively, while the Japanese yen remained largely flat. Oil prices fell almost 17 percent, yet the riskiest junk bonds rallied sharply. Cryptocurrency markets were similarly volatile. Bitcoin surged past $125,000 in October after Trump launched a memecoin and pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, only to crash to $88,000, ending the year down about 5.5 percent. The “Magnificent Seven” US tech giants lost some of their earlier shine, with AI darling Nvidia becoming the world’s first $5 trillion company in October, highlighting the uneven distribution of gains in the tech sector. Goldman Sachs estimates that the major AI hyperscalers spent nearly $400 billion in 2025 and project $530 billion in 2026, fueling both excitement and investor caution.Trump’s return and policies had ripple effects across markets. European defense stocks jumped nearly 60 percent, anticipating reduced US military protection prompting rearmament across NATO countries. European banks recorded their best year since 1997, South Korean stocks surged 70 percent, and defaulted Venezuelan bonds approached 100 percent returns.US Treasury yields also saw dramatic swings. The 30-year yield rose above 5.1 percent in May, its highest since 2007, before settling at 4.8 percent. Bond markets are closely monitoring the widening “term premia” gap, signaling renewed volatility. Japan’s 30-year yields also neared record highs, even as local-currency emerging market debt had its best year since 2009.Trump’s engagement with Russia helped the rouble surge 36 percent, while Ghana’s cedi led gold-producing countries with a 28 percent increase. Other emerging currencies like Poland’s zloty, Czech crown, Hungarian forint, and Taiwan’s dollar all showed double-digit gains, prompting analysts to suggest the 14-year bear cycle for EM currencies may be over.The outlook for 2026 remains uncertain. Trump is gearing up for midterm elections and is expected to appoint a new head of the Federal Reserve, raising questions about the central bank’s independence. Markets will also watch elections in France, Britain, Japan, Israel, Colombia, Brazil, and Hungary. Analysts warn that AI developments, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and stimulus policies could continue to drive extreme market volatility.Matt King, founder of Satori Insights, described the situation as “remarkable,” noting that valuations are stretched, easy-money policies are under pressure, and cracks are already visible in bond markets, gold, and cryptocurrency trends.DoubleLine fund manager Bill Campbell summed up the year: “2025 has been a year of change and surprises, with trade wars, geopolitics, and debt all intertwined.

A three-member Jamaat delegation met the CEC in the afternoon at Nirbachon Bhaban in the city. The Jamaat leader said their leaders who are playing roles in the election, including the Ameer-e-Jamaat, the Secretary General and other central and top leaders, will conduct extensive tours in different areas. “They will need to travel massively. We have drawn attention to their security issues.” He said the Election Commission told them that the issue falls under the jurisdiction of the relevant ministry and the EC would talk to it and take necessary initiatives from its side. Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair said a big party is violating the election code of conduct and they (Jamaat) sought immediate steps in this regard. “You may have seen various types of cards issued by a big party. We have seen those mainly through journalist friends. They are making different promises. They will distribute so many lakhs or crores of cards. They are promising that cardholders will receive thousands or lakhs of taka per card. These acts are clear violations of the election rules and the code of conduct,” he said.

Each person will receive lakhs of taka.” He said they asked the EC to install CCTV cameras at polling stations as it is very important for ensuring a free and fair election. “If CCTV cameras are not installed, we believe terrorists and those with ill intentions will get a major opportunity to disrupt and sabotage the election.

Polls on October 29 erupted into days of violent protests over claims that President Samia Suluhu Hassan had rigged the polls and was behind a campaign of murders and abductions of her critics. She was declared winner with 98 percent of the vote. More than 1,000 people were shot dead by security forces over several days of unrest, according to the opposition and rights groups, though the government has yet to give a final toll. Despite attempts to suppress information, anger within the east African nation has grown with some saying they will return to the streets on December 9. In a statement in Swahili late Friday, police spokesperson David Misime said officials had seen the calls on social media but noted: “No identifiable person has so far submitted formal notification for the planned demonstrations.” Citing police guidelines, the statement said that “given the unlawful tactics that have surfaced,” the proposed rally “no longer meets the legal requirements to be authorized.” “Therefore, the Police Force, as of today, bans the planned demonstrations described as peaceful and indefinite,” it said. The statement added calls for the proposed rally were being coordinated by individuals using “telephone numbers based both inside and outside Tanzania, as well as anonymous online accounts managed by persons outside the country.” It follows a decision by Meta earlier this week to suspend the Instagram accounts of two Tanzanian activists after they posted images of the violent crackdown on election protests.

Bangladesh also sought Cambodia’s support towards realizing its interest in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) overseen by ASEAN. The first FOC meeting was convened following the signing of an MOU back in 2020 during a bilateral Joint Commission meeting at the Ministerial level in Dhaka. The FOC agenda covered the entire gamut of bilateral relations and stressed the need for activating the various Agreements and MOUs concluded between the two countries. Both sides noted steady growth in bilateral trade and emphasised deepening business to business contacts. They agreed to convene the first Joint Trade Council meeting at the earliest convenient time in Phnom Penh next year.

{"title": "Israeli military moves in southern Syria heighten regional tensions", "body": "Israeli military operations inside southern Syria have intensified tensions and raised concerns about a prolonged Israeli presence as forces expand control within and around a buffer zone near the Golan Heights. Last month, Israeli troops carried out a raid in the village of Beit Jin in southwestern Syria, during which 13 residents were killed, according to local accounts. Israel said the operation targeted members of a militant group planning attacks into Israel and that its forces came under fire, wounding six soldiers, before responding with ground fire and air support. Syrian authorities described the incident as a massacre, while residents rejected Israeli claims that militants were operating in the village. The raid was one of several recent Israeli actions in Syria that have increased local opposition and reduced prospects for improved relations between the two countries, despite pressure from the United States to ease tensions. Prospects for limited Israeli-Syrian engagement had emerged late last year after Sunni Islamist-led rebels removed former Syrian President Bashar Assad, a close ally of Iran. Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has said he does not seek conflict with Israel. Israel, however, has expressed distrust of al-Sharaa due to his past militant affiliations. Israeli forces subsequently moved into the United Nations monitored buffer zone in southern Syria adjacent to the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed, a step not widely recognised internationally. Israeli troops have established checkpoints, military positions and landing sites, including on Mt Hermon, and have increased patrols and drone surveillance across nearby Syrian areas.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/israeli-military-moves-in-southern-syria-heighten-regional-tensions", "date": "2025-12-16T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 259},

We will take to the streets for resistance. In Dhaka and across Bangladesh, we will hold resistance rallies against Indian hegemony and all anti-Bangladesh conspiracies,” he added. Nahid was addressing the all-party resistance rally protesting the attempted killing of Osman Hadi, organised by Inqilab Mancha at the Central Shaheed Minar this afternoon. The NCP Convener said December 16 symbolises not only victory but also the beginning of a long journey of resistance. “Just as we achieved victory on December 16, 1971, our journey of resistance also began that day. That resistance was against Indian aggression, and it has continued to this day,” he said. He said if India believed it could continue political interference in Bangladesh after August 5, including manipulating elections, “that assumption is wrong and will be proven wrong”. Referring to the shooting of Osman Hadi, Nahid said the attack was not an isolated incident. “With the bullet hitting Osman Hadi, the July Revolution has been attacked. Every time Bangladesh is attacked, its youth rise in resistance,” he said. In this connection, he said that the rally carried a clear message that Bangladesh and the forces of the July Revolution remain united. Nahid also questioned the moral legitimacy of the Chief Election Commissioner following his recent remarks. “After such statements, he has no moral right to remain in office. Whether a free and fair election is possible under him is a question before the nation,” he said and expressed the hope that the statement would be withdrawn immediately. Nahid said calls had been raised for the resignation of the home adviser, arguing that he had lost moral authority to remain in office. “Since August 5, the law and order situation has not returned to normalcy. Participants of the July uprising have been targeted, martyr families harassed, and justice has not been ensured,” Nahid said. The rally, which began at 3:00 pm, was attended by leaders and activists of various political, social and cultural organisations. Representatives of BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, Gano Odhikar Parishad, AB Party and Islami Andolan Bangladesh, among others, joined the programme.

Washington took control of the tanker in a dramatic raid that saw US forces rope down from a helicopter onto the vessel in an operation that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said was aimed at Maduro’s “regime.”Treasury officials said three nephews of Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, were being slapped with sanctions, labeling two of the men “narco-traffickers operating in Venezuela.”“Nicolas Maduro and his criminal associates in Venezuela are flooding the United States with drugs that are poisoning the American people,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. President Donald Trump’s administration has been piling pressure on Venezuela for months with a major naval buildup in the region that has been accompanied by strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that have killed close to 90 people.Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Thursday expressed support during a phone call with his ally Maduro, but with Moscow’s forces tied down in a grinding war in Ukraine, its capacity to provide aid is limited.“The vessel will go to a US port and the United States does intend to seize the oil,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists of the tanker.“We’re not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black-market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narco-terrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world.”Earlier on Thursday, Noem told a congressional hearing that the tanker operation was “pushing back on a regime that is systematically covering and flooding our country with deadly drugs” — a reference to US allegations of narcotics smuggling by Maduro’s government.A video released Wednesday by US Attorney General Pam Bondi showed American forces descending from a helicopter onto the tanker’s deck, then entering the ship’s bridge with weapons raised.Bondi said the ship was part of an “illicit oil shipping network” that was used to carry sanctioned oil.Venezuela’s foreign ministry said it “strongly denounces and condemns what constitutes blatant theft and an act of international piracy.” “They kidnapped the crew, stole the ship and have inaugurated a new era, the era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean,” Maduro said at a presidential event on Thursday, adding: “Venezuela will secure all ships to guarantee the free trade of its oil around the world.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday expressed concern over the escalating tensions and urged restraint.“We are calling on all actors to refrain from action that could further escalate bilateral tensions and destabilize Venezuela and the region,” his spokesperson said.US media reported that the tanker had been heading for Cuba — another American rival — and that the ship was stopped by the US Coast Guard.Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday he questioned the legality of the tanker seizure and that “any president, before he engages in an act of war, has to have the authorization of the American people through Congress.”“This president is preparing for an invasion of Venezuela, simply said. And if the American people are in favor of that, I’d be surprised,” Durbin told CNN.Washington has accused Maduro of leading the alleged “Cartel of the Suns,” which it declared a “narco-terrorist” organization last month, and has offered a $50 million reward for information leading to his capture.Trump told Politico on Monday that Maduro’s “days are numbered” and declined to rule out a US ground invasion of Venezuela.The Trump administration alleges that Maduro’s hold on power is illegitimate and that he stole Venezuela’s July 2024 election.Maduro — the political heir to leftist leader Hugo Chavez — says the United States is bent on regime change and wants to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/us-slaps-sanctions-on-maduro-relatives", "date": "2025-12-13T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 661},

The seminar was held at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences Conference Room (NAC 1024) and attended by distinguished faculty members, students, academics, and legal and political enthusiasts, says a press release. The seminar was graced by the presence of its Keynote Speaker, Dr Mostafa Haider, Lecturer at Curtin Law School, Curtin University.Prof. Md. Rizwanul Islam, Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, officially opened the program with his introductory remarks, where he introduced the keynote speaker and shared his observation on the judicialization of politics and the demand for a more inclusive and resilient democratic order. The Keynote Speaker, Dr. Mostafa Haider, Lecturer at Curtin Law School at Curtin University, presented on the topic, igniting thought-provoking discussions. He stated that the recent uprising in Bangladesh serves as a significant case study for understanding that law and politics in most parts of the postcolonial world are often organized around aspirational democratic rule. The speaker focuses on rulership and their competing views in Bangladesh. In such attempts to discipline politics with law, create an illusion of democracy. He elaborated how Bangladesh is softly impacted by external factors and how taking over State power can hardly be considered democracy. Additionally, he concluded that the techniques of rule include binaries such as public-private, secular-religious, nationalist-anti-nationalist, and many others enable the arbitrariness of ruling. The presentation was followed by an engaging Q and A segment.Prof. Ishtiaque Ahmed, Barrister and Chair at the Department of Law at NSU, delivered the concluding remarks. He pointed out the essence of sovereignty, the will of the people, and the need for continuous dialogue on the evolving nature of citizenship and rights. He also expressed gratitude to the speaker and guests for their valuable contributions. Mr. Md. Lokman Hussain, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Law and Coordinator for NSU Center for Legal Research, moderated the session.The presenter was thanked with a token of appreciation.

At the same time, the portrait of Sheikh Mujib on the upper wall of the old building at the hall’s entrance was disfigured. Earlier on Thursday night, students of the dormitory pasted posters reading ‘Shaheed Sharif Osman Hadi Hall’ over the hall’s nameplate. Earlier on Saturday, Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU) announced a programme to besiege the Vice-Chancellor’s office at 2:30pm on Sunday, demanding the renaming of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall and Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib Hall. According to a media release signed by the DUCSU Literary and Cultural Affairs Secretary, the central student union announced to enforce the programme to press their three demands, renaming Mujib Hall as Shaheed Osman Hadi Hall, Fazilatunnesa Hall as Felani Hall, and taking administrative action against teachers, officers, and staff who took position against the July uprising. Speaking about the removal of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall’s name, the hall’s Vice President Muslimur Rahman said those responsible for Hadi’s killing are linked to the fallen fascist forces, and Sheikh Mujib is the ideological father of those fascists. “By removing Sheikh Mujib’s name and renaming the hall after Osman Hadi, we are showing respect for Hadi,” he said. Despite identifying the killers, the government has failed to arrest the killers, he alleged, saying that “From our position, this is what we can do renaming the hall after Hadi.” Muslimur claimed that they conducted an opinion poll where the majority of students supported the renaming of the hall.

{"title": "Rush for imports ahead of Ramadan", "body": "A surge in imports of chickpeas, dates, apples, and oranges even before Ramadan is driven by anticipated demand spikes. Over 303,125 tonnes of these four items have received import permits (IPs) from the Chittagong Seaport Plant Quarantine Centre under the Agriculture Extension Department. Most chickpea and date importers hail from Khattunganj, while apple and orange traders dominate Chittagong Fruit Market. Statistics from July 1 to December 11 show 129,093 tonnes of chickpea permits issued, but only 58,161 tonnes imported-a third of approvals. Dates saw 48,118 tonnes permitted versus 7,972.828 tonnes arrived. Apples had 78,685 tonnes approved and 49,334 tonnes imported; oranges 47,229 tonnes permitted and 42,605 tonnes landed. Importers like Payel Traders, Allahor Rahmat Stores, and Satota Traders from Khattunganj, plus Arif Fruit Centre and Jamal Food Agency from Kotwali, lead the pack. Traders opened more letters of credit (LCs) this year, citing eased dollar shortages and Ramadan demand. Annual chickpea needs hit 150,000-160,000 tonnes, with 95,000-105,000 tonnes during Ramadan alone, prompting early stockpiling. Khattunganj Aratdar Association Secretary General Mohammad Mahiuddin noted easier LC access and falling international booking rates have boosted imports, dropping wholesale chickpea prices from 105 taka/kg last year to 75 taka/kg now-leading to losses. He predicts no price hikes if supply outpaces demand. Fruit Market Association Secretary General Muhammad Touhidul Alam highlighted high duties inflating costs for dates, oranges, and apples, amid slumping demand. Rumors swirl of duty cuts soon, potentially easing prices. An anonymous chickpea importer plans Ramadan-timed shipments for peak profits, expecting ample stock to stabilize rates. Chittagong C&amp;F Agents Association President SM Saiful Alam confirmed year-round IPs, with Ramadan accelerating arrivals.Despite low global rates and steady inflows, Ramadan prices often spike. With over two months until mid-February&#39;s Ramadan start, stockpiles are building. Consumer Association of Bangladesh (CAB) Chittagong Secretary General Kazi Iqbal Bahar Chawdhury calls for immediate demand audits, import tracking, and ministry oversight to expose syndicates if prices rise despite surplus.

Osman Hadi was the youngest of three brothers and three sisters. Every member of the family was associated with scholars or religious education, which provided a strong moral foundation for Osman Hadi’s thoughts and character. His elder brother, Maulana Abu Bakr Siddique, is the Khatib of the traditional Sharfuddin Ahmed Sentu Jame Mosque in Barisal. Elder brother, Maulana Omar Faruk, is a businessman in Dhaka. His three brothers-in-law are also involved in teaching madrasas and imamship in mosques, who are highly respected at the local area. Osman Hadi’s educational career began at the famous NS Kamil Madrasa in Jhalakathi. He was a brilliant student and an excellent speaker from his student days. The desire to protest injustice was in him since childhood. In an interview, he proudly recalled his beloved madrasa. In 2001, He admitted in the department of Political Science of Dhaka University. He struggled for his Islamic apparel during campus life, especially the period of ‘Shahbagh Movement’ of 2013, from the anti-Jamaat-e Islami environment and his teachers’ student activists believes on secular culture. Then he swear to change the political ‘Culture’ and identifies that ‘Indian Cultural hegemony’ and ‘Progressive Practice’ create this situation that blames that ‘Islamists are terrorists’. He was a Lecturer of University of Scholars.He has a daughter named ‘Firnas’ who is about one year old. His wife is very modest and never appeared in front of media. During Awami era, He wrote Poems, songs and all other literacy works in the pseudonym ‘Shimanta Sharif’. All this literacy works were against the narrative the left leaning activists believes and practices, Awami League defends.

The organization’s declared goal is to protect the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh by taking a stand against all forms of hegemony and dictatorship, and to build a state system based on justice. Democratic participation, justice, and political accountability are highlighted as the main foundations of this platform. Hadi harshly criticized the country’s major political parties, especially the old-style politics, at various press conferences and public meetings. Regarding BNP, he commented that it is not possible to remain in power without people-centered politics. At the same time, he criticized the structural weaknesses of the interim government and proposed the formation of a national government ensuring representation of all political parties. He was one of the most talked about young leaders in the movement demanding the Awami League be banned as a terrorist and seditious organization in 2025.

I took that preparation by working on the small screen. Over these ten years, I have shaped myself specifically for cinema.” She added, “Over the past few years, I was often asked-am I returning to films? Will I act on the big screen again? Now there is no need to say anything separately. I am returning through ‘Tribunal’-that is the answer.

{"title": "Child labour persists in Dhaka’s urban informal economy despite legal safeguards", "body": "Child labour remains a persistent and growing reality in Dhaka city, driven by poverty, weak enforcement and social acceptance, according to new research presented on Wednesday. The study, titled “Child Labour in Urban Context: Analysing Socio-Economic Factors, Root Causes, and Sustainable Strategic Solutions,” finds that despite a strong legal framework, millions of children continue to work, many of them in hazardous conditions within the urban informal economy. The event was held in a city hotel in the capital by Educo Bangladesh and the Child Labour Elimination Platform (CLEP), moderated by Md Shahidul Islam of Educo Bangladesh. Afzal Kabir Khan of Educo Bangladesh delivered the welcome speech. Mohammad Mozammel Haque, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Md Abdul Wadud, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Advocate Seema Haque, President, BNWLA spoke on the occasion. Speakers at the event stressed that eliminating child labour in urban contexts requires strong collaboration between government agencies, local authorities, civil society, the private sector, and communities. They also highlighted the importance of evidence-based policymaking and child-centered approaches to ensure that interventions effectively protect children’s rights and promote their well-being. In his research findings, Aminur Rahman, Team Leader and Senior Researcher of EQMS Consulting Limited, said that Bangladesh has adopted a range of protective laws and policies, and also ratified major international instruments but these commitments have not translated into effective protection on the ground, particularly in cities. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, around 3.53 million children are currently engaged in work across the country, with 1.06 million involved in hazardous labour. At 9.2 per cent, the proportion of child labour in Bangladesh is higher than the global average of 7.8 per cent, and is rising even as global figures show a decline. The study highlights that urban child labour is concentrated mainly in informal sectors such as domestic work, small workshops, construction, street vending, markets and waste collection, where oversight is minimal. The survey covering 150 households was conducted in six Dhaka neighbourhoods: Lalbagh, Hazaribagh, Kamrangirchar, Adabor, Mohammadpur and Mirpur. Both working children and their parents or caregivers participated in the study. Findings show that children enter the workforce at a very young age, with some starting as early as six years old and most between the ages of 10 and 14. The average age of working children surveyed was just over 12. Educational attainment was low, with more than 92 per cent of children clustered at Class 5, while about one-third of parents or caregivers had no formal education at all. Household income ranged from Tk 8,900 to Tk 50,000 per month, but nearly 69 per cent of households with working children were living below the poverty line. Work patterns revealed long hours and limited rest. Almost half of the children worked seven days a week, averaging more than five hours a day, mainly in industrial production, construction and street-based activities. The impact on well-being was clear, with nearly half of the children describing themselves as unhappy or very unhappy about working at their age. The study also documents serious workplace risks. More than 38 per cent of children reported injuries such as cuts, burns, fractures or falls, with most injured multiple times in the past year. Over half reported experiences of violence or exploitation affecting themselves or their parents, while the vast majority relied on local pharmacies rather than formal healthcare services. Poverty emerged as the dominant root cause, cited by both children and parents as the primary reason for working. Economic instability, irregular adult employment, rising living costs and the absence of savings leave families dependent on children’s income for survival. Rapid urbanisation compounds the problem, as migrant families settle in slums without secure housing or services, pushing children quickly into available informal jobs. The research also points to major structural challenges. Enforcement of child labour laws is weak in the informal economy, government monitoring is constrained by limited budgets and trained manpower, and social workers are too few to respond effectively. Many NGO interventions remain short-term and project-based, while deep-rooted social norms continue to frame child labour as an acceptable coping strategy. To address these challenges, the study calls for a shift towards sustainable, multi-sectoral solutions. It emphasises the need to stabilise household incomes through livelihood support and skills training, particularly for women, to reduce reliance on children’s earnings. Stronger coordination between labour, education and child protection authorities, alongside expanded inspection capacity in informal sectors, is also seen as critical. Speaking at the event, Joint Secretary Mohammad Mozammel Haque said the government alone cannot eliminate child labour, nor can any single organisation do so on its own. “This is a collective task,” he said, adding that the government wants to move forward by engaging the corporate sector. If a specific portion of large companies’ CSR funds is allocated to tackling child labour, real change would be possible, he noted. He also pointed out that debt traps, illness or the death of income-earning family members often force children into work. In this context, he stressed the importance of practical, employment-oriented technical and vocational education rather than certificate-based training, so that children can grow into skilled and self-reliant citizens. He urged stakeholders to move forward by recognising ground realities and focusing on education and skills development. “Child labour cannot be eliminated unless the socio-economic conditions of society change,” said Abdul Wadud. “Our efforts must continue, policies must be properly implemented, and technical education can play a crucial role in eliminating child labour.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/child-labour-persists-in-dhakas-urban-informal-economy-despite-legal-safeguards", "date": "2025-12-24T18:37:42+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 912},

{"title": "NCP leader Motaleb shot in Khulna", "body": "Motaleb Shikder, the Khulna divisional head of the National Citizen Party (NCP) and a central organiser of the party’s labour wing, Jatiya Sramik Shakti, was shot by unidentified assailants in Khulna on Monday morning, in an incident that police say is shrouded in mystery. The shooting took place at around 11:45am at a rented house on Masjid Road, adjacent to Gazi Medical College Hospital. Witnesses said the attackers aimed at Shikder’s head before fleeing the scene immediately. Police suspect that the shooting of Md Motaleb Shikder, occur an “internal dispute within the house.” Animesh Mondal, officer-in-charge (investigation) of Sonadanga Model Police Station, said locals rescued the injured leader and rushed him to Khulna Medical College Hospital. He was later transferred to the City Imaging Centre for advanced imaging tests. Doctors said the bullet did not penetrate his skull but ruptured the skin of his head, and that he is now out of danger. Police said the motive behind the attack remains unclear and the identities of those involved have yet to be established. Law enforcement agencies have launched a drive to identify and arrest the assailants, officers said. The case took a more complex turn after police searched the room where the shooting occurred and recovered a spent bullet shell casing along with equipment and remnants indicating drug use. According to police, the house had been rented in November by a young woman named Tonni, who had been living there with her husband. Local sources said Shikder regularly visited the house. Immediately after the incident, the tenant couple went into hiding. Khulna Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner (South) Tajul Islam said the disappearance of the couple has added to the mystery surrounding the case. He said efforts are underway to trace and arrest them for questioning. Police officials said they are examining whether the shooting stemmed from a dispute involving drugs or a personal relationship, though they cautioned that the investigation is still at a preliminary stage. The shooting comes amid heightened concern over political violence in the country. On 12 December, Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi was critically injured after being shot in Dhaka’s Paltan area. After initial treatment in Dhaka, he was airlifted to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died on 18 December. His killing sparked widespread protests and demands for swift justice.

{"title": "Candidate shot, aplomb shaken as polls enters tense phase", "body": "The election calendar is moving forward, but many aspiring lawmakers are doing so with hesitation, anxiety and, in some cases, a quiet question hanging over their plans: Will the vote really be held on time—and will it be safe to contest it? Those doubts have sharpened since the daylight shooting of Sharif Osman bin Hadi, the convener of Inqilab Mancha and a potential independent candidate in the Dhaka-8 constituency. The attack, carried out on a busy city street just a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th national parliamentary election, sent a chill through the political class, particularly among candidates from smaller parties and independent platforms. The election is scheduled for February 12, but the shooting has reinforced a lingering belief among some politicians that the process remains fragile and vulnerable to disruption. For many first-time candidates and lesser-known party nominees, the violence has become a symbol of deeper uncertainty about law and order during the early stages of the campaign. Across the country, nominated candidates have begun collecting nomination papers from returning officers’ offices, signaling that the formal race has begun. Yet the mood on the ground is far from celebratory. In several districts, candidates say preparations are proceeding alongside quiet recalculations about personal security and political risk. In Narayanganj, those anxieties took a concrete form on Saturday when Masuduzzaman Masud, the BNP’s nominated candidate for the Narayanganj-5 (Sadar–Bandar) constituency, announced that he was withdrawing from the race. Speaking at a news conference at the Narayanganj Press Club, he cited security and family reasons for his decision. His withdrawal prompted mixed reactions among party leaders, activists and supporters, and raised questions about whether other factors may also have been at play. The attack on Mr. Hadi has become a reference point in these conversations. Many candidates now see it as an early warning of serious weaknesses in the country’s law and order situation at a critical moment in the election cycle. Some potential candidates have already applied for firearms licenses, while political leaders across party lines have openly questioned whether it is possible to campaign freely if candidates fear for their lives. Dr. Badiul Alam Majumdar, a prominent election analyst, said the interim government remains institutionally neutral despite individual political leanings within it, and that it is committed to delivering a credible election. “The biggest challenge right now,” he said, “is keeping the law and order situation election-friendly.” He warned that restoring a policing system weakened by years of politicization would be essential. Dr. Majumdar said the attempted killing of Mr. Hadi had deepened fears about whether the election could proceed without intimidation. Although defeated political forces may have fled, he added, their networks remain active. “They are trying to sabotage the election through threats and conspiracies,” he said, urging unity against what he described as destabilizing forces. Those concerns reached the highest levels of government over the weekend. Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus convened an emergency meeting at the state guest house Jamuna with leaders of the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party. Participants from all three parties questioned whether current security arrangements were sufficient and called for stronger protection for candidates, as well as a nationwide crackdown on illegal weapons. According to people present at the meeting, Professor Yunus warned that the attack on Mr. Hadi should not be dismissed as an isolated act. “This attack is highly symbolic,” he said. “The conspirators have expanded their networks. They have deployed trained shooters. A powerful force is at work, trying to derail the entire election process.” After the meeting, BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed said the party could not rule out the possibility of further attacks. Jamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Mia Golam Parwar pointed to deep political polarization as an opening for hostile actors. National Citizen Party convener Nahid Islam went further, arguing that selective security for a few leaders would not address the broader crisis. “If the unresolved political questions remain,” he said, “none of us is truly safe.” The Chief Adviser’s press wing later announced that the BNP, Jamaat and NCP would jointly organize a protest rally condemning the attack on Mr. Hadi, while Inqilab Mancha plans to hold an all-party protest meeting in the coming days. At the same time, the government has moved to expand security options for candidates. The Home Affairs Ministry has relaxed firearms licensing rules, allowing election candidates and what it terms “politically important” individuals to apply for licenses and armed guards. The decision, taken without prior consultation with the Election Commission, has sparked debate over whether introducing more legal weapons into an already tense environment could increase the risk of electoral violence. Election experts warn that signs of confrontation are already emerging on the ground. In such a context, they say, issuing new weapons licenses—rather than prioritizing disarmament—could further complicate the security landscape. The Election Commission, for its part, has issued a comprehensive circular outlining measures to maintain law and order during the election and a simultaneous referendum. The armed forces have been deployed in support of the civil administration and granted magisterial powers through February 28, with officials promising a peaceful, fair and “festive” voting environment. Meanwhile, major parties are pressing ahead with preparations. BNP candidates have begun collecting nomination papers nationwide, and the party has convened a series of meetings in Dhaka with candidates and allies, some attended virtually by its acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, from London. Nomination submissions are underway, with December 29 set as the final date. Returning officers’ offices have grown increasingly crowded with candidates, proposers and supporters, even as unease lingers beneath the procedural momentum. As Bangladesh edges closer to February, the shooting of Sharif Osman bin Hadi has become an early and unsettling test—not only of the state’s ability to secure an election, but of whether fear or faith will ultimately define the road to the ballot box.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/candidate-shot-aplomb-shaken-as-polls-enters-tense-phase", "date": "2025-12-19T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 980},
{"title": "No alternative to mother’s breast milk for babies’ nutrition", "body": "Raida Khanam is an officer of a private bank. As she spends most of the day in her office, Najma feeds her eight-month-old son powdered milk to ‘ensure nutrition’. The milk brand belongs to a reputed company that wrote on the packet ‘the milk can be given from birth!’ The plastic feeder that is used to feed milk has a write-up on it ‘For Angel’ (for godchild)! Misled by such flashy advertisements and misinformation, many parents like Raida are feeding alternative baby food to their beloved children. The number of children consuming powdered milk is increasing as most of these children is suffering from malnutrition and their immune system is also decreasing. But taking advantage of the ignorance of the parents, the concerned people are showing ‘thumbs down’ to the law regarding this. The law prohibits the enticing advertisement or promotion of formula or packaged infant formula, other foods and equipment as substitutes for breast milk. The Act of 2013 clearly mentions that packets and formula products must be labeled “There is no food equal to or superior to mother’s milk for infants”. It must also be written “This (package/packet) food is not completely germ-free.” There is a risk of the baby getting sick if it is consumed. There are also guidelines on the marketing and purchase of alternative baby food. However, it has been seen on the ground in various general stores and supershops of the capital that the companies and sellers of alternative baby food and equipment are not following these instructions. None of the buyers and sellers know much about the law in this regard. There is also no public-private initiative to promote the Child Health Welfare Act, reports BSS. Therefore, this law called ‘Sale and Marketing of Breast Milk Alternative Baby Food’ seems to be limited to a lot of paper.Concerned said that even after years, there is not much promotion of alternative baby food law. Without knowing that, ordinary shopkeepers are displaying and selling these powdered milk and other food in the shop. At the same time, it is being sold in various supershops. Parents and guardians of children are also not aware of these foods. Doctors and nutritionists said that mother’s breast milk is the best nutritious food for the baby from birth to two years. Alternative formula is very harmful for babies. This milk reduces the immune system of the newborn. Children often get sick, physical development does not happen properly. Two types of alternative baby foods are generally available in the market. Powdered milk made in ‘special formula’ is given to babies aged six months, one year or two years after the birth of a baby. The other is ‘formula food’ that is given as a supplementary food along with mother’s milk for babies above six months.In this context, National Mental Health Institute and Hospital Professor Dr. Helal Uddin Ahmed said that any food with nutritional value will help in mental development. But the alternative baby food has no importance for the child’s development up to two years, he added. For this, he said mother’s breast milk is enough. No other food can compete mother’s breast milk in the context of nutrients. However, if the mother is ill or the mother take any medicine for which the child cannot be breastfed, measures should be taken according to the doctor’s advice, he added.There are initiatives around the world to ensure that babies are breastfed after birth. In 1981, the World Health Organization in Geneva developed a set of principles to regulate the marketing of breast milk substitutes, known as the ‘International In the light of that principle, the ‘Breast milk Substitute Food (Marketing Policy) Act’ was enacted in 1984 in Bangladesh. The Act was amended on 22 October 2013. The law also asked for regulation of marketing of alternative foods to protect the health of children up to five years of age. In the amended law, the fine has been increased to Taka five lakh and the imprisonment period has been increased to three years for violating the law. The law also doubles the fine and imprisonment for second time offense. However, from the supershops of the capital Dhaka to different upazilas of the country, various brands of breast milk substitutes and milk are being sold freely.Just as the sellers are not following the law, the marketers of these food products are also not following the rules of writing the instructions mentioned in the law on the packet / container properly. Bangladesh Breastfeeding Foundation (BBF) oversees the marketing of alternative infant formula through its own initiative and with the support of the government. BBF Chairperson Dr SK Roy said that about 30 lakh babies are born every year in the country. “Therefore, the number of two-year-old children stands at around 60 lakh. It is a challenge to ensure that each of these large numbers of children is breastfed for two years. Our parents are unaware of this”. “Moreover, law promotion and awareness activities depend on manpower and financial allocation. The government is trying to increase the allocation. The BBF and the Public Health Nutrition Institute have prepared a five-year strategy to increase awareness in this regard,” he added.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/no-alternative-to-mothers-breast-milk-for-babies-nutrition", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 865},

{"title": "Global coal demand expected to hit record in 2025: IEA", "body": "Global coal consumption is expected to hit a record in 2025, the IEA said Wednesday, thanks in part to policy measures introduced by the Trump administration to boost the industry.In its annual report on the coal industry, the International Energy Agency said demand was on course to rise by 0.5 percent this year to hit a record 8.85 billion tonnes, although demand is expected to decline over the rest of the decade as rival generation options multiply.China and India are usually the main drivers of growth in coal consumption as the two emerging economies race to meet rising demand for electricity.But demand for coal, which is the main contributor of climate warming carbon dioxide emissions from human sources, held steady in China and fell in India.The IEA sees demand in China, the top coal consuming nation, decreasing somewhat over the next five years.In India, an early and intense monsoon season gave a boost to hydropower and reduced demand for electricity produced from coal-fired power plants for only the third time in five decades, the IEA said.However, “strong policy support for coal in the United States … helped lift coal demand there in 2025,” said the IEA.It said US “consumption is poised to increase by eight percent in 2025 amid a combination of higher natural gas prices and a slowdown in the retirement of coal plants due to policy support led by the federal government,” said the IEA.That contrasts to an average drop of six percent per year over the past 15 years.President Donald Trump in April signed measures to “turbocharge coal mining” in the United States and more than double electricity production to keep up with power-hungry artificial intelligence technology.However the IEA said it still expects US coal demand to decline by six percent per year on average through 2030, as renewable power generation grows and coal plants are taken offline, albeit at a slower pace than previously expected.Higher than forecast electricity demand or slower coal plant retirements could slow the decline in US coal use, as could the price of natural gas, another fuel used to generate electricity. Globally, the IEA sees coal demand in 2030 easing by three percent compared with 2025, with strong growth in electricity use supporting coal use. “But competition with other power sources is also set to intensify, with renewable capacity surging, nuclear expanding steadily, and a wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG) arriving on the market,” it said.Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA’s director for energy markets and security, noted that coal’s share in power generation continues to decline.“In 2013, it was 41 percent, and in 2025 we expect it to be around 34 percent,” he said. “And that’s the lowest in the IEA’s history of statistics.”The Paris-based IEA advises its 32 energy-consuming member countries on energy policy and monitors market developments.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/global-coal-demand-expected-to-hit-record-in-2025-iea", "date": "2025-12-19T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 467},

{"title": "Taskin’s sour and sweet day in IL T20", "body": "Taskin Ahmed was seen in a different light in the IL T20 in Dubai on Monday. Taskin was excellent, classic with the new ball. Taskin was faded, harmless in the death over with the old ball. However, the Bangladesh pace star would definitely had a big smile on his face if the team won. For Sharjah Warriors, Taskin took 2 wickets for 41 runs in 4 overs. However, his bowling in the power play at the beginning of the innings was excellent. He took 2 wickets for 16 runs in 3 overs. He came to bowl the last over and digested four sixes. He gave away 25 runs. That changed his bowling style. Taskin, playing IL T20 for the first time, took 8 wickets in 5 matches with a bowling average of 21.75 and an Economy of 8.70. Batting first, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders scored 134 runs for 9 wickets. Sharjah Warriors came out to reply and secured a 4-wicket victory with the last ball of the innings. Their hero of the match was Adil Rashid with 3 wickets for 18 runs. Taskin played the key role at the beginning of the match. But in the end, his poor bowling left him shaken. In the first over of the innings, Taskin took the wicket of Phil Salt. Salt caught him while flying the ball outside his off-stump. In the next over, Taskin took the wicket of Alex Hales. Hales drove the ball outside his off-stump and was caught by Ethan D’Souza at cover. He came to bowl the fifth over of the power play and digested two boundaries. Even then, Taskin pocketed 2 wickets for 16 runs in 3 overs. Then Taskin came to bowl the very last over. The Knight Riders’ run was 104 for 7 wickets. But the right-arm pacer did a really bad job at the end. Andre Russell and Jason Holder hit two sixes each in his over. That faded his bowling spell. 2 wickets for 41 runs in 4 overs.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/taskins-sour-and-sweet-day-in-il-t20", "date": "2025-12-24T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 335},

{"title": "Dhaka calls for united stand against hatred, violence", "body": "Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain, currently in Riyadh, on Sunday urged the global community to reject all forms of incitement to hatred-both online and offline-and to stand firmly against violence, intolerance and discrimination. “With this commitment, we must promote unity, deepen understanding, celebrate diversity and uphold our shared humanity,” he said while addressing the 11th Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC). The adviser stressed the importance of empowering youth, encouraging intergenerational dialogue and placing young people at the centre of global efforts to foster respect across civilizations, cultures and faiths. He also underscored the need to invest in inclusive education that promotes peace, tolerance and social cohesion, while expanding cultural exchanges, arts, sports and responsible media to build empathy and mutual trust. Highlighting issues of justice, Hossain said accountability must be ensured for victims of forced displacement resulting from ethnic discrimination. The two-day forum is being hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Adviser Hossain arrived in Riyadh on Saturday and is scheduled to return home on Tuesday, a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told media. He expressed appreciation to the governments of Spain and Türkiye, the Group of Friends of the Alliance, and the High Representative for their forward-looking leadership. “Peace remains the ultimate goal of the UNAOC,” he said, noting that Bangladesh is among the leading troop-contributing countries to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Reaffirming Bangladesh’s commitment to global peace, Hossain strongly condemned the recent attack on a UN peacekeeping logistics base in Kadugli, Sudan, which killed six Bangladeshi peacekeepers and injured several others. “This tragic incident is a sobering reminder that conflicts continue to escalate and humanitarian crises are deepening worldwide,” he said. He warned that xenophobia, intolerance, racism and Islamophobia are spreading across continents, while persecution and displacement based on ethnicity or religion continue to trouble the global conscience. At the same time, Hossain noted, divisions are accelerating in the digital age, with misinformation, hate speech and deepfake content posing serious threats to peace and shared human values.Against this backdrop, he said Bangladesh remains firmly aligned with the Group of Friends in advancing intercultural and interfaith dialogue, tolerance and mutual respect.“Our annual UN resolution on the Culture of Peace reflects our belief that peace is not merely the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice, compassion and human dignity,” he said.True to this principle, he added, Bangladesh has sheltered more than 1.2 million Rohingyas-victims of genocide in Myanmar-who must be allowed to return safely and with dignity to their homeland.Describing the Alliance as a vital platform for dialogue, Hossain said it has helped transform differences into understanding and mistrust into empathy, while emphasising that far greater efforts are still required.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/dhaka-calls-for-united-stand-against-hatred-violence", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 452},

Journalists attempting to contact the upazila administration could not obtain any information.Residents and several BNP leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity over the phone, said that Shah Riazul Hannan, the BNP-nominated candidate for Kapasia’s 4th constituency, has requested local authorities to take action to stop the illegal soil cutting.A few days ago, based on secret reports of similar nighttime illegal soil cutting in the same area, the upazila administration seized one soil-cutting machine. Sensing the presence of officials, the operators and workers fled the scene.When contacted by phone, SI Shubharaj of Kapasia Police Station did not answer calls.

I think it would be smart for him to do that.”But he added: “If he wants to do something — if he plays tough, it’ll be the last time he’s ever able to play tough.”Firing back just hours later, Maduro said that Trump would be “better off” if he focused on domestic problems rather than threatening Caracas. “He would be better off in his own country on economic and social issues, and he would be better off in the world if he took care of his country’s affairs,” Maduro said in a speech broadcast on public television.The pledge from Moscow, which is embroiled in the war in Ukraine, came on the eve of a UN Security Council meeting Tuesday to discuss the mounting crisis.In a phone call, the foreign ministers of the allied nations blasted the US actions, which have included strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats and the seizure of two oil tankers.A third ship was being pursued, a US official told AFP on Sunday.“The ministers expressed their deep concern over the escalation of Washington’s actions in the Caribbean Sea, which could have serious consequences for the region and threaten international shipping,” the Russian foreign ministry said of the call between Sergei Lavrov and Venezuelan counterpart Yvan Gil.“The Russian side reaffirmed its full support for and solidarity with the Venezuelan leadership and people in the current context,” it added in a statement.US forces have since September launched strikes on boats that Washington claims, without providing evidence, were trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.More than 100 people have been killed — some of them fishermen, according to their families and governments.The latest strike hit a “low-profile vessel” in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing one occupant, the US military said on Monday.Last week, Trump also announced a blockade of “sanctioned oil vessels” sailing to and from Venezuela.Trump claims Caracas is using oil money to finance “drug terrorism, human trafficking, murder and kidnapping.”Caracas, in turn, fears Washington is seeking regime change, and has accused Washington of “international piracy.”Moscow’s statement said Lavrov and Gil agreed in their call to “coordinate their actions on the international stage, particularly at the UN.”Russia and China, another Venezuela ally, backed Caracas’s request for a UNSC meeting to discuss what it called “the ongoing US aggression.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/trump-says-would-be-smart-for-maduro-to-resign", "date": "2025-12-24T00:02:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 465},

The inauguration ceremony was held at the Apon Friendship Exchange Center in the city’s Baridhara area, where speakers expressed optimism that the initiative would promote people-to-people connectivity through literature and intellectual dialogue.Jointly organised by the China Writers Association and the Apon Friendship Exchange Center, the club aims to create a sustainable platform for cooperation among writers, researchers, publishers and readers of both countries. The club’s plaque was unveiled by Li Shaofeng, cultural counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh, and Yu Guangyue Anandi, director of the Bangla Department of China Media Group (CMG), in the presence of noted Bangladeshi writers, publishers, researchers and literature enthusiasts. Speaking on the occasion, Yu Guangyue Anandi said China has a five-thousand-year old history and a rich literary heritage, adding that the club would allow Bangladeshi readers greater access to Chinese literature and help expand bilateral literary exchanges.Eminent writer Ahmed Riaz said the folk traditions of both countries span thousands of years, noting that the exchange of folk narratives could serve as a strong foundation for wider literary cooperation. Publisher Pradip Roy of Prosidhi Publishers said the club would open opportunities to translate Chinese books into Bangla and Bangladeshi books into Chinese, while also encouraging collaboration in book fairs and the exchange of modern publishing technologies.Faisal Abdullah, feature editor of CMG Bangla’s Dhaka office, said language barriers have limited Bangladeshi readers’ access to Chinese literature, expressing hope that the club would serve as an effective platform for translation, publication and promotion of literary works from both countries.In his remarks, Cultural Counsellor of Chinese Embassy Li Shaofeng said the establishment of the club was significant, as it would enable deeper dialogue among writers, researchers and readers of both nations.People-to-people exchanges, particularly in literature and ideas, would further strengthen China-Bangladesh relations and described the club as a positive example of connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative, he added.Li also stressed the importance of organising regular reading circles at the Chinese Book Corner of the National Library with participation from Bangladeshi writers, and assured continued cooperation with local writers and publishers working on Chinese literature.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/bangladesh-china-literature-readers-club-launched", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 379},

Tarique’s wife Dr Zubaida Rahman and their daughter Zaima Rahman, who accompanied him on the journey from Heathrow Airport to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, went to the hospital around 5:10pm.

The area remained heavily crowded as mourners, many traveling from distant areas, gathered to offer prayers and visit the grave. Security personnel and volunteers were seen managing the flow of visitors to prevent congestion on the adjacent roadway. Mourners came from different parts of the city, and from outside the capital as well, arrived to offer prayers and pay their last respects. Many carried flowers, recited verses from the Quran and stood silently in contemplation at the graveside.Witnesses said mass people started gathering before sunrise. By mid morning, the crowd had swelled, spilling over onto the adjoining footpaths and even part of the roadway. The heavy turnout caused significant congestion in the surrounding area. Traffic slowed to a crawl as motorists attempted to navigate through the mass of pedestrians, parked vehicles and onlookers. At several points, police and traffic officials were seen redirecting vehicles and asking pedestrians to remain on one side of the road. Rickshaw pullers and motorcyclists waited impatiently at intersections as the crowd periodically blocked their path. Law enforcement agencies and local authorities deployed additional personnel to the site to ensure security and crowd control. Bangladesh plunged into grief as the nation observed a state mourning day for Sharif Osman Bin Hadi, the intrepid Inqilab Moncho activist whose brutal killing has ignited outrage and renewed calls for justice. He was a living reflex of Kazi Nazrul Islam in our fractured times, exposed the rot of corruption with a courage that now defines his eternal legacy. Hadi’s final hours unfolded like a tragedy scripted in truthfulness and transparent justice. Hadi’s life was a heroic ideal of unmasked truths, delivered with the raw fire of a poet-warrior. Rising from the streets of Dhaka, he joined Inqilab Moncho – a youth-led movement demanding accountability after the July Revolution. His “bloody revelations,” as activists call them, were livestreams and speeches that peeled back the veil on the superior classes’ corruption. “Corruption is the cancer eating our revolution,” Hadi roared in one clip, viewed millions of times. His words, laced with Quranic verses and Nazrul’s rebellious fervour, mobilised thousands, turning Inqilab Moncho into a mass medium against the very betrayals that birthed the uprising. Sharif Osman Bin Hadi was no armchair critic. He embodied patriotism’s purest form: selfless, honest, and unrelenting and he was born to humble roots, he dropped university to lead street protests, embodying Nazrul’s “Bidrohi” spirit, the rebel poet who defied colonial chains.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/teary-mass-people-gather-to-pay-tribute-the-fearless-hero-osman-hadis-grave", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 424},

The adviser made the remarks as the chief guest at the inaugural session of the 10th Biennial Fisheries Conference held at the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) auditorium in the capital. The conference was organised by the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Forum. Farida Akhter said fish is not merely a source of food to satisfy hunger, but an important provider of essential nutrition. She noted that fish contains vital micronutrients such as calcium and other elements that are crucial for eye health, bone strength and intellectual development.She also said that fish-based dietary habits have played a significant role in the intellectual development of the nation. Referring to marine fisheries, the adviser said that only about 30 percent of Bangladesh’s marine fishery resources are currently being utilised. She pointed out that artisanal and industrial trawlers catch fish using different methods, and some technologies used by industrial trawlers have recently raised serious concerns. She mentioned reports indicating that sonar technology, which poses a risk of overfishing in the sea, is being used by nearly 70 out of 223 industrial trawlers operating in the country. Effective policies are needed to address these emerging challenges, she said.In this context, Farida Akhter added that the government has decided to update the national fisheries policy as a key initiative to ensure sustainable and safe fisheries management.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/raising-fisheries-production-meaningless-without-ensuring-food-safety", "date": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 266},

He made the remarks while briefing reporters after a two-hour security meeting at Nirbachan Bhaban, held in preparation for the upcoming national election and referendum scheduled for February 12, 2026.

On the issue of candidate security, he said the matter was discussed in detail and that security agencies assured the EC of adequate protection for election aspirants. “Police have already implemented a security protocol, and protection is being provided accordingly. If anyone feels unsafe, they may contact the police for additional measures,” he added. Sanaullah also noted that the enforcement of the electoral code of conduct was reviewed during the meeting, expressing general satisfaction with the current situation.

{"title": "Mirza Abbas calls attack on Hadi part of wider conspiracy", "body": "BNP senior leader Mirza Abbas on Saturday described the gun attack on Inqilab Mancha convener Sharif Osman bin Hadi ahead of the election as a small part of a larger conspiracy, not an isolated incident. “This is not an isolated incident. First Ershad Ullah was attacked in Chattogram, now Hadi has been attacked in Dhaka. This is a small part of a big conspiracy. More plots will come to light in the coming days,” he said. The BNP leader made the remarks while speaking at a protest rally in front of the party’s Nayapaltan central office. The rally was organised by BNP Dhaka South city unit to protest the attacks on Hadi and Ershad Ullah and to demand quick justice. He said a similar attack had been made earlier, referring to the shooting of Ershad Ullah in Chattogram. “The attack on Osman Hadi is an assault on people’s democratic rights, sovereignty and freedom,” he said, calling for resistance against dark forces. “These forces must be stopped and given a strong reply. Those trying to create chaos should be careful.” Abbas, a BNP Standing Committee Member, claimed the attack was pre-planned, saying Hadi was shot around 2:00pm and within half an hour social media posts began calling people to unite and create chaos. “This shows it was all planned.” Osman Hadi was shot in Dhaka a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th parliamentary election and referendum, setting February 12 as polling day, leaving him seriously injured. He is currently undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital with a bullet injury to his head. Hadi was campaigning to contest the Dhaka-8 seat as an independent candidate. Earlier, on November 5, BNP-nominated candidate Ershad Ullah was also shot while campaigning in the Chattogram-8 seat. Abbas, who has also been nominated by BNP to contest the Dhaka-8 seat, narrated facing aggressive slogans when he went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to see the injured Osman Hadi. Abbas said those who shouted slogans were not supporters of Hadi but leaders of an associate organisation of another political party, alleging they wanted Hadi to die by disrupting his treatment. Condemning the attack, Mirza Abbas said Osman Hadi was “like a son” to him. “When I heard that Hadi was shot, I was mentally shaken. This is an attack on democracy,” he said. Abbas said he did not wish death on anyone, regardless of political identity, but stressed that those involved in violence and incitement must be arrested. “We want the attackers of Hadi to be arrested and the masks of those behind the plot to be removed,” he said. Calling Osman Hadi a brave street activist, Mirza Abbas said, “He is not my electoral rival, he is my competitor. I hope to see him active again in the election field soon.” After the rally, a protest procession was brought out from Nayapaltan, which marched through Bijoynagar and Fakirapool before ending in front of the BNP party office.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/mirza-abbas-calls-attack-on-hadi-part-of-wider-conspiracy", "date": "2025-12-13T20:11:59+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 494},

The IGP made the remarks on Tuesday while speaking at a meeting on election management with returning officers and field administration officials, held at the Nirbachan Bhaban at Agargaon, Dhaka. He emphasised that the police will take strict administrative measures to maintain law and order across the country. Referring to challenges faced by the police in the post-July period, the IGP said that although the force encountered adverse situations while maintaining law and order, it has now overcome those difficulties. “Having reached this stage before the elections, I firmly believe that our force has acquired sufficient capacity to maintain law and order,” he said.He also warned against creating public suffering by blocking roads or highways over minor issues. “It is time to stop the trend of creating unrest in different parts of society by blocking roads and highways over trivial matters. If order cannot be established everywhere, it will be difficult to provide full support to the Election Commission,” he added.Praising the Election Commission (EC), the police chief welcomed the decision to empower the Electoral Inquiry Committee to conduct summary trials of election-related crimes. He also thanked the EC for allowing magistrates to seek assistance from any law enforcement agency, in addition to the police, when necessary.At the meeting, the IGP sought clarification from the EC regarding field-level reshuffles within the police administration. He noted that while the commission has clear instructions on the transfer of superintendents of police (SPs) and senior officers, further guidelines are needed on whether prior EC approval is required for reshuffles at lower levels, such as constables or sub-inspectors.Reiterating his commitment, Alam said, “The police are determined to make this election successful and peaceful with all its might and efforts. The countrymen and the Election Commission can have full confidence in us.”Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) A M M Nasir Uddin was present at the meeting, along with Election Commissioners Abdur Rahmanel Masud, Begum Tahmida Ahmad, Md.

I hope I get that chance,” Akbar said after a practice session with the Rajshahi Warriors at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur. “Ultimately, the management will decide who plays and who doesn’t. If my chance comes, I’ll make sure to take full advantage.” Traditionally a wicketkeeper-batter, Akbar will have a slightly different role this season. The team management has entrusted veteran Mushfiqur Rahim with the wicketkeeping duties, allowing Akbar to focus purely on his batting. Akbar expressed his understanding of the decision and his readiness to adapt. “I am ready to play in any role. I will give my best, regardless of the position I am asked to play. The main goal is to perform well, whatever the responsibility.”Mushfiqur, 38, was seen working on his wicketkeeping skills during training after head coach Hannan announced him as the team’s primary gloveman. Akbar is excited to have him as a teammate. “Mushfiqur bhai is a legend. Having him in the team is a big blessing. There’s a lot to learn from him,” Akbar added. “Every player can take something from his experience, and we’ll all try to learn as much as possible.”Akbar’s confidence is high after a series of successful months. He led Rangpur Division to titles in both the National Cricket League (NCL) T20 and the four-day competition. Additionally, he captained Bangladesh A to the final of the ACC Emerging Asia Cup earlier this year, further establishing himself as both a leader and a performer.Although Akbar is yet to break into the national team, unlike many of his Under-19 teammates, he has been in strong form, finishing as the second-highest run-scorer in the NCL T20 with 222 runs at a strike rate of 147. These impressive stats underscore his growing confidence and adaptability in the shorter format.Akbar is now eager to carry that form into the BPL to strengthen his case for a national team call-up. “I’m really keen to keep up my form. Hopefully, if I earn a spot in the Rajshahi team, I’ll have a good BPL.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/akbar-optimistic-to-shine-as-pure-batter-in-bpl", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 382},

Mbappe missed several earlier chances before getting his opportunity from the spot four minutes from time on Saturday, and he made no mistake to net his ?59th goal in as many games across all competitions in 2025 to level Ronaldo’s 2013 haul. “Today, and because of the record, it’s incredible, in my first year to be able to do what Cristiano did,” Mbappe told RMTV. “My idol, the best player in the history of Real Madrid and a reference in world football. It’s an honour for me.” Jude Bellingham put Real in front in the opening half, and Sevilla went down to 10 men with 22 minutes remaining after Marcao received a second booking, but the hosts had goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to thank for keeping them ahead. Real are second in the La Liga standings on 42 points, one behind Barcelona, who are away to third-placed Villarreal on Sunday, while Sevilla are ninth on 20 points. Xabi Alonso’s side were looking to end the year on a high note after losing top spot in November with three consecutive draws, and they saw out 2025 with three successive wins in all competitions, but it was far from a straightforward success. Sevilla created plenty of problems early on, with Isaac Romero chipping a shot narrowly wide when sent through on goal, bringing whistles from the home crowd with Real under pressure.Mbappe sent a snap shot wide, as the hosts struggled to find a clear-cut chance, and Sevilla’s Lucien Agoume put another strike wide for the visitors before Real went in front seven minutes before the break.

{"title": "Hamas urges stronger global pressure on Israel", "body": "Hamas on Tuesday urged the international community to increase pressure on Israel before the group proceeds with the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire. A senior Hamas official said the group wants Israel to reopen a major border crossing, halt lethal attacks, and allow greater humanitarian access to the war-ravaged territory. Israel, meanwhile, says it is prepared to advance to the next, more complex stage of the 20-point ceasefire plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, and is insisting that Hamas first return the remains of the final Israeli hostage still held in Gaza. Husam Badran, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, demanded that all commitments in the ceasefire’s initial phase be fully carried out before any further steps are taken. He accused Israel of continuing to demolish Palestinian homes in areas of Gaza it still controls. According to Palestinian health authorities, Israeli airstrikes and gunfire have killed at least 376 Palestinians since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10. Badran said the conditions for entering the second phase have not yet been met, signaling a firmer stance from Hamas. However, Hamas has limited bargaining power and may face strong pressure from regional actors such as Qatar and Turkey not to stall the fragile ceasefire. Israel has accused Hamas of breaching the agreement and says its recent strikes are responses to attacks on Israeli soldiers. Israeli forces also acknowledge shooting Palestinians who approached the “Yellow Line,” a loosely defined boundary between Israeli-controlled areas and the rest of Gaza. While Israel maintains that those killed were suspected militants, some victims-among them women and children-appear to have been civilians. Humanitarian shortfalls Aid agencies, including the United Nations, warn that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire and that incoming aid is far below agreed-upon levels. The ceasefire arrangement called for at least 600 aid trucks per day, but over the past month the U.N. has recorded only about 120 daily. Commercial truck numbers are unclear. Cogat, the Israeli body overseeing aid entry, claims 600-800 trucks are arriving daily. Still, the U.N. says many goods are unaffordable and essential proteins remain scarce. It also reports that medical supplies have not significantly increased and that some hospitals continue to face acute shortages. Israel announced Wednesday that it would start allowing Gaza-bound aid through a Jordan-Israel border crossing. Border crossings and political plans The ceasefire plan also requires reopening the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for two-way traffic. Israel says it is ready to let Palestinians exit Gaza through Rafah but not yet to reenter. A U.S.-backed proposal for Gaza’s future has gained traction recently, with negotiations over upcoming ceasefire phases-expected to include Hamas’ disarmament-set to begin soon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that both sides are close to entering the second ceasefire stage, pending Hamas’ return of the remaining hostage’s body. Hamas says widespread destruction from Israeli strikes has hindered their search. Officials also say an international body to administer Gaza may be announced by year’s end. Israel’s two-year military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 70,300 Palestinians-around half of them women and children-according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Although the ministry operates under the Hamas-run government, it is staffed by medical professionals and its data is generally regarded as reliable internationally. The conflict began after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, which killed roughly 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 251 hostages. Most hostages or their remains have since been returned through ceasefires or negotiated agreements.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/hamas-urges-stronger-global-pressure-on-israel", "date": "2025-12-11T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 579},

Around 60 people have died and more than half a million have been displaced since hostilities resumed last week between the Southeast Asian neighbours, shattering a ceasefire that President Donald Trumphad brokered in late July. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow on Friday, reiterating Washington’s concerns and urging Thailand to de-escalate the situation and return to the ceasefire deal, the State Department said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts on Thursday and said both had “expressed their desire to ease tensions and achieve a ceasefire”, China’s Foreign Ministry said. “The intensity of this round of clashes has far exceeded previous incidents, and if it continues, it will benefit neither side and will undermine (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) unity,” the ministry said in a statement, adding a special envoy had visited both countries in an effort to restore peace. The Thai Foreign Ministry said Sihasak had reaffirmed Bangkok’s position to Rubio and “shared information on the way forward,” including joining Monday’s ASEAN meeting. The ministry also confirmed the call with Wang. Cambodia has not commented on the overtures from Washington and Beijing.Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn is also set to join the meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Monday, which would be the first face-to-face meeting between the governments since the fighting resumed on December 8. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the ASEAN chair who helped broker the July ceasefire, said this week he was cautiously optimistic about the meeting because the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia were both keen to reach an amicable solution. Thailand and Cambodia accuse each other of moves that led to the breakdown of the July truce, which was expanded into a wider agreement to help settle the conflict in October. The neighbours have long disputed sections of their 817-km (508-mile) land border. The fighting now stretches from forested inland areas near Laos to coastal provinces. Fighting continued on Friday across the frontier, with Cambodia firing heavy weapons into some area and Thailand retaliating, a Thai Defence Ministry spokesperson said. Tensions had simmered since Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures – including withdrawing troops and heavy weapons and freeing Cambodian prisoners of war – in response to the maiming of a Thai soldier by a landmine. Thailand says the mine was among several laid recently by Cambodia, which rejects the allegation. Bangkok insists that any end to the current fighting must start with a cessation of hostilities by the other side and a clear ceasefire proposal, while Phnom Penh maintains that it is defending itself against military actions by its neighbour.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/china-us-seek-thailand-cambodia-ceasefire-ahead-of-asean-meeting", "date": "2025-12-20T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 553},

The claim contrasted with his administration’s earlier remarks, which cited a combination of national security concerns, Arctic strategy, and the potential of critical minerals and natural resources as drivers of U.S. interest. On Sunday, Trump announced the appointment of Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as his special envoy to Greenland. “We have to have it (Greenland) and he (Landry) wanted to lead the charge,” Trump said. In response, Landry said on X that the special envoy position would be “a volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.” “They say Denmark owns it. Denmark has spent no money and has no military protection,” Trump said. Greenland, a former Danish colony, was granted home rule in 1979. In 2009, Denmark passed the Act on Greenland Self-Government, expanding the island’s authority over its domestic affairs. However, Denmark retains authority over Greenland’s foreign, defense and security policy, according to information on the website of the Prime Minister’s Office of Denmark. Trump’s appointment of the envoy to Greenland has sparked strong diplomatic reactions in Greenland, Denmark and the European Union. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Monday that he would summon U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Kenneth Howery over the appointment. “I am very upset about this appointment of a special envoy. And I am particularly upset about the envoy’s statements, which we find completely unacceptable,” Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster TV 2. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Monday in a joint statement that they expect respect for their “joint territorial integrity” from the U.S. side. “We have said it very clearly before. Now we say it again. You cannot annex other countries. Not even with an argument about international security. Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland,” the statement said. “Preserving the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark, its sovereignty and the inviolability of its borders is essential for the European Union (EU),” EU Foreign Affairs spokesperson Anouar El Anouni told a press conference Monday, adding that the bloc’s stance is grounded in a long-standing position on the issue.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/trump-renews-call-to-take-over-greenland-despite-strong-objections", "date": "2025-12-23T20:02:53+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 396},

{"title": "Rishad joins Hobart for Big Bash return", "body": "Bangladesh leg spinner Rishad Hossain has left for Australia to take part in the upcoming Big Bash League, where he will play for defending champions Hobart Hurricanes. With this, his dream is coming into true, as he was unable to play last season as the BCB did not grant him the No-Objection Certificate. Rishad is the only Bangladeshi cricketer after Shakib Al Hasan to play this Australian league. This time, the clearance came early, which also kept Rishad out of the Bangladesh Premier League auction. Hobart retained their faith in him during the draft, calling him in the second round. Before that, they secured England fast bowler Chris Jordan as their first overseas pick, and later added another English leg spinner, Rehan Ahmed, in the fourth round. Jordan has been a key figure for Hobart over the last two seasons, taking seven wickets during their title-winning campaign last year and nine wickets the previous season. He remains the Hurricanes’ preferred option in the death overs and was their top overseas priority once again. With Rishad and Rehan both in the squad, two of Hobart’s three overseas slots are now occupied by leg spinners who can also contribute with the bat. Rehan brings stronger red-ball batting credentials, with six first-class centuries, while Rishad has featured in ninety-six recognized T20 matches, scoring one fifty at a strike rate of 134.39. Rehan last played competitive cricket in mid-November and recently recovered from injury, which British media say will not affect his Big Bash availability. Only three overseas players can feature in a match-day eleven, making competition for places intense. Fast bowler Nathan Ellis led the team last season.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/rishad-joins-hobart-for-big-bash-return", "date": "2025-12-11T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 275},

Habib’s song ‘Bhalobasbo Basbo Re Bondhu Tomay Jotone’ sung by Habib in this movie became popular. After that, Habib sang in almost all of Alik’s movies. Not only that, he also lent his voice to many songs written by Alik. Among the popular songs of this duo are ‘Prithibir Joto Sukh Joto Bhalobasa’, ‘Bolo Keno Emon Hoy’, ‘Jotsna Kotha Bolo Na’ etc. Habib last sang a song written by SA Haque Alik in movie ‘Golui’ in 2022. Zareen sang with Habib in the song titled ‘Jombe Mela’. Habib also composed the tunes and arranged the music. The director of this government-funded movie is Alik. Habib sang a solo song written by Alik for an album outside the movie 17 years ago in the album ‘Obosheshe’ released in 2008. Almost a decade and a half after that song, Alik wrote a song for Habib again outside the movie. The song titled ‘Piriti Shikhaili’ will be released on Habib’s YouTube channel. Apart from giving voice, Habib has also arranged tune and music of the song ‘Piriti Shikhaili’. About the new song, Alik said, “After many years, a song was written for Habib outside of cinema. The last one was written in one of Habib’s albums in 2008. After all these years, an audio song written by me in Habib’s voice is being released again. I like the tune and music arrangement of the song.” Last September, Alik announced on social media that he is writing four new songs for Habib. One of which is a duet and the remaining three are Habib’s solos. The releasing process of songs is starting with ‘Piriti Shikhaili’. Habib regularly releases songs on his YouTube channel.

{"title": "Oscars to honor casting for the first time, spotlighting a vital filmmaking craft", "body": "Behind the world of Oz in the two-part “Wicked” films were the people responsible for choosing who would inhabit it. Long before filming began, casting directors were quietly shaping the production by selecting the actors who ultimately brought the story to life. “Our job is to know every actor out there — or know how to find the ones we don’t,” said Bernard Telsey, one of the industry’s leading casting directors who, along with Tiffany Little Canfield, cast both “Wicked” movies. Casting will receive long-awaited recognition at the next Oscars. The Academy Awards will introduce a new category honoring achievement in casting when the 98th ceremony airs live on ABC on March 15, 2026 — a milestone many in the field say is overdue. “It’s hard for people to understand what we do because it all happens behind closed doors,” Telsey said. “This award will strengthen the profession and raise awareness of our work.” The Emmys already feature three casting categories, and the Critics Choice Awards added one this year. Casting directors also have their own long-running Artios Awards. But the Golden Globes and Tony Awards still exclude the craft. “When casting is excellent, it can feel invisible — because it blends so well you don’t notice the fingerprints,” said Destiny Lilly, president of the 1,200-member Casting Society and a colleague of Telsey. She noted that casting often begins before most of the production team is hired. Telsey’s company, The Telsey Office, casts projects across film, television and theater — from movies such as “Mary Poppins Returns” to series like “The Gilded Age” and “Only Murders in the Building.” He made his name in theater, shaping casts for Tony-winning shows including “Hairspray,” “Kinky Boots” and “Maybe Happy Ending.” “Wicked” and its sequel “Wicked: For Good” were among his team’s most ambitious undertakings, requiring hundreds of performers across more than a year of filming on multiple continents. Though Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande now seem inevitable as Elphaba and Glinda, their casting wasn’t guaranteed. “You don’t really know until they’re in the room,” Telsey said. “Then you see the magic.” Telsey stays current by attending theater four or five nights a week and spending weekends watching TV and films. His team meets twice a week to discuss emerging talent. “Every day you feel like you’re behind,” he said. “There are always more actors to discover.” Casting directors typically begin by discussing a project’s vision with the director, writers and producers before assembling actors to audition. Lilly recently made waves by recommending comedian Bill Burr for his Broadway debut in “Glengarry Glen Ross,” believing his energy suited Mamet’s dialogue. She emphasized that crossover between stage and screen is now routine. Telsey agrees: “Good acting is good acting. The technical demands differ, but the craft is the same.” Telsey, whose breakthrough came with the original casting of “Rent,” said the rise of global productions, streaming platforms and virtual auditions has dramatically reshaped casting. “We’re always expanding our reach,” he said. “Time is short, budgets are shrinking, and the need to find the right cast quickly is only growing.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/oscars-to-honor-casting-for-the-first-time-spotlighting-a-vital-filmmaking-craft", "date": "2025-12-11T12:52:27+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 515},

{"title": "Baruipara bridge cost soars to Tk 136cr amid delays", "body": "A project envisioned as a vital connectivity link for Narail has instead come to epitomise years of delay, mounting costs and unmet promises. Construction of the Barui Para Bridge over the Nabaganga River in Kalia upazila of Narail distrct has dragged on for nearly eight years, far exceeding its original one-and-a-half-year deadline.With only partial progress achieved, local residents and commuters continue to endure daily hardship, growing increasingly frustrated as deadline after deadline slips by. The prolonged delay has also come at a heavy financial cost. Originally approved at Tk 65 crore, the project’s budget has ballooned to around Tk 136 crore-almost two and a half times higher-largely due to design complications and repeated extensions, report UNB. Once completed, the bridge is expected to significantly improve road connectivity between Narail Sadar and Kalia upazila, while also easing communication with at least three neighbouring districts. Until then, the unfinished structure stands as a reminder of stalled promises.Supervised by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD), construction of the bridge began in 2018. Despite the passage of time, the project remains incomplete. The latest extension has set June next year as the new deadline. So far, work on 11 piers, 11 spans and the approach roads on both sides of the river have been completed. However, the most critical section-the central portion of the bridge-remains unfinished. This includes three piers and three steel spans that are yet to be installed, locals said.According to RHD sources, the PC girder bridge measures 651.83 metres in length and 10.25 metres in width. While the original contract value stood at Tk 65 crore, repeated design modifications and time overruns have pushed the total project cost to Tk 135.92 crore.The initial contractor, M/s JamilIqbal and Moinuddin Bashi Construction Company, was awarded the project in 2018. The construction process, however, faced major setbacks after the No-9 pier was washed away twice following collisions with bulkheads.Unable to complete four piers and three spans of the main structure, the contractor spent Tk 61 crore before the Roads and Highways Department ultimately terminated the first-phase contract after multiple deadline extensions.Subsequently, the RHD awarded the remaining work under a second-phase contract to Concrete and Steel Technologist Ltd.The firm has reported that installation work has already begun on three imported steel spans, including a large 86.73-metre steel arch span sourced from abroad.Abdul Wadud Khan Liton, a responsible official of the contracting firm, acknowledged the delays, attributing them to the complexities involved in importing specialised steel spans.“We expect to complete installation of two spans within this month. We are hopeful that the central arch span will be installed and handed over to the authorities before the deadline,” he said.Narail Roads and Highways Department Executive Engineer MdNazrul Islam said construction work has resumed in full swing after correcting earlier design flaws.He expressed optimism that the long-awaited project would finally be completed by mid-June next year, paving the way for the bridge to be opened to traffic.For now, however, residents of Narailcontinue to wait watching an unfinished bridge stretch across the river, emblematic of both promise and prolonged delay.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/baruipara-bridge-cost-soars-to-tk-136cr-amid-delays", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 511},

Salim Ahmad Khan, team leader of the Out of Country Voting System Development and Implementation (OCV-SDI) project for expatriate voter registration, confirmed BSS that a total of 41,543 expatriate voters in 10 countries were sent postal ballots on Friday evening and Saturday. He said the EC will allocate election symbols to candidates on January 21. After symbol allocation, voters will be informed through the app or the Election Commission’s website.

He added that if any expatriate voter casts a vote before symbol allocation (being already sure about a candidate), that vote will be invalidated. However, as per rules, expatriates are expected to vote after seeing the candidates following symbol allocation. EC officials said that on Friday evening, postal ballots were sent to expatriate Bangladeshis living in Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Malaysia. Among these, 892 ballots were sent to Australia, 573 to the UK and 6,246 to Malaysia.

These hearings will be closed to the public and media.“The hearings will be devoted to the merits of the case and will include the examination of witnesses and an expert called by the Parties,” the ICJ said in a statement.Filed by The Gambia to the UN’s top court in 2019, the case accuses authorities in Myanmar of violating the UN genocide convention during a brutal crackdown by the country’s army and Buddhist militias on the Rohingya in 2017.More than 742,000 Rohingya fled the bloodshed, while witnesses reported murders, rape and entire villages burned to the ground.As a result, the ICJ, which rules on disputes between countries, ordered Myanmar in 2020 to “take all measures within its power” to prevent a genocide.Speaking at a special high-level United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting on the situation of the Rohingya in September this year, The Gambia’s Minister of Justice Dawda Jallow said he hoped to see a judgement from the court “soon after” January’s public hearings.“We filed our case in November 2019, almost six years ago. Now, we are preparing for the oral hearing on the merits in this case, which the court has scheduled for mid-January 2026,” Jallow said.“The Gambia will present its case as to why Myanmar is responsible for the Rohingya genocide and must make reparations to its victims,” he added.Wai Wai Nu, executive director of the Women’s Peace Network-Myanmar, told Al Jazeera in September that the number of countries that have intervened in support of The Gambia’s case at the ICJ is “actually very powerful”.“They could come together and do something to stop ongoing atrocities in Rakhine State,” where armed violence against the Rohingya is ongoing, Wai Wai Nu said, adding that the UN Security Council could also take action without waiting for the ICJ.About one million Rohingya lived in Myanmar prior to 2017 – making up a small percentage of the country’s population of 55 million people – and entire communities fled across the neighbouring border into Bangladesh as the military campaign of ethnic cleansing ramped up.Now, more than one million Rohingya live in the world’s largest refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, across the border in Bangladesh, which has been pressing for other governments to step in and shoulder the burden of hosting vast numbers of refugees.Many of the refugees have been living in impoverished conditions in the camp for years, while others have faced perilous journeys on boats in a bid to reach other countries.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/uns-top-court-to-hold-myanmar-genocide-hearings-in-january", "date": "2025-12-21T00:02:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 568},

{"title": "Kounde double helps Barca claim Frankfurt comeback win", "body": "Unlikely goalscoring hero Jules Kounde bagged two headers to help Barcelona beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 on Tuesday in the Champions League and bolster the club’s chances of a top-eight league phase finish. Ansgar Knauff sent the visitors into a surprise lead but French defender Kounde’s brace early in the second half put last season’s semi-finalists in control. In the club’s first Champions League match back at Camp Nou since 2022, they gained revenge against a Frankfurt side who humiliated them in the Europa League in that same year. The Bundesliga team packed the Camp Nou with their own fans and knocked Barca out of that competition at one of their lowest ebbs under Xavi Hernandez. With a domestic treble and a run to the final four of the Champions League, Xavi’s successor Hansi Flick has changed the mood around Barca, but this season the team have struggled at times. Defeats by Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain left Barca in a difficult position in Europe, but by beating Frankfurt they are still hopeful of avoiding the play-off round. “I wasn’t surprised (it was hard), the Champions League is different… I am very proud,” Flick told reporters. The coach said making the comeback “shows a lot about our attitude”, but accepted it would be “a better situation” to take the lead in games. Barcelona made tickets harder for Frankfurt fans to obtain this time around by delaying their sale, and beyond a small number of visiting supporters who appeared to be ejected from home areas, there was little trouble. Barcelona controlled the opening period, pinning the visitors, who lost 6-0 against RB Leipzig on Saturday in the Bundesliga, back in their own territory. Veteran striker Robert Lewandowski put the ball in the net but it was ruled out for an offside earlier in the move. Despite their dominant start, the Catalans fell behind after 21 minutes, caught out by a rapid Frankfurt counter-attack. Lamine Yamal dribbled into trouble and Nathaniel Brown surged forward from the back before dropping a ball in behind Barca’s high defensive line for Knauff to charge on to. Gerard Martin tried and failed to intercept it with a flick of the leg and the German striker held off Alejandro Balde before finishing neatly.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/kounde-double-helps-barca-claim-frankfurt-comeback-win", "date": "2025-12-11T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 374},
{"title": "Russia says made ‘proposal’ to France over jailed researcher", "body": "Moscow has made an offer to Paris regarding jailed French researcher Laurent Vinatier, who is facing espionage charges that could see him sentenced to 20 years in a Russian prison, the Kremlin said on Thursday.The surprise public overture comes as both Russia and France have expressed interest in possible talks between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron.Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO and was jailed in June 2024, is serving a three-year sentence for failing to register as a “foreign agent” but faces fresh allegations of spying.“There were appropriate contacts between our side and the French. Indeed, a proposal was made to the French regarding Vinatier,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including AFP.Peskov did not provide details.“The ball is now in France’s court,” he added.Vinatier’s family have rejected the accusations against him, saying he is a victim of tensions between Moscow and Paris over the war in Ukraine.Western countries have long accused Russia of arresting their citizens on baseless charges, seeking to use them as bargaining chips to secure the release of alleged Russian spies and cyber criminals jailed in Europe and the United States.Putin said last week he would look into Vinatier’s case after a French journalist asked him about it during an end-of-year televised press conference.“I don’t know anything about this case. This is the first I’ve heard of it,” Putin said.“But I promise you I’ll definitely find out what it is. And if there’s even the slightest chance of resolving this matter favorably, if Russian law allows it, we’ll make every effort,” Putin said.Asked by AFP about the Kremlin statement, the French foreign ministry declined to comment.The Kremlin said at weekend that Putin was “ready” to engage in dialogue with Macron.This came after the French leader extended an olive branch to Moscow, opening the chances the two men would soon speak amid a flurry of diplomacy over the Ukraine war.Macron has urged Russia to free Vinatier, saying he is being unfairly detained and that the “propaganda” against him “does not match reality.” He is one of several Westerners to have been arrested after Putin launched an all-out offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.Several US citizens have been imprisoned and then released in exchanges brokered by both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden.In the original case, prosecutors accused Vinatier of gathering military information without registering with the Russian authorities – something he apologized for and said he was not aware he was required to do.Speaking Russian during that trial, he said that in his work he always tried to “present Russia’s interests in international relations.”In brief remarks as he was led by police from a court hearing in the Russian capital over the summer, he said he was “tired.”Asked whether he felt like a “hostage” of the authorities, he replied in French: “Yes.”Moscow has used alleged breaches of the “foreign agents” law to arrest people before then applying more serious charges – as happened to Vinatier.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/russia-says-made-proposal-to-france-over-jailed-researcher", "date": "2025-12-26T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 495},

The statement came during a high-level summit in Muscat, where both leaders voiced “serious concern over the ongoing Israeli aggression” and described the occupation as a “clear violation” of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and other international resolutions. The two sides also expressed support for international efforts to de-escalate tensions, stabilize the situation on the ground, facilitate the return of displaced persons, and advance post-conflict reconstruction. Aoun led a Lebanese ministerial delegation to Oman that included Lebanon’s ministers of foreign affairs, interior, defense, health, and agriculture for talks with Omani officials. The joint statement emphasized the strengthening of bilateral ties and expanding cooperation in key sectors including politics, the economy, investment, banking, tourism, transport, and logistics. Both sides called for early preparations to hold the first session of the Omani-Lebanese Joint Committee, chaired by the two foreign ministers in Muscat, and to pursue new agreements and memorandums of understanding intended to enhance collaboration in trade, culture, and science. The statement also highlighted the need to boost private sector engagement in shared development opportunities. The Omani side reaffirmed its full support for Lebanon’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, as well as for strengthening Lebanese state institutions, particularly the army and legitimate security forces, and backing the country’s ongoing economic, financial, and administrative reforms. The two sides reaffirmed the unified Arab position on ending the Israeli occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. They also underscored the importance of strengthening Arab solidarity, respecting the sovereignty of states, and upholding the principles of good neighborliness and international law. Aoun’s official visit to Oman took place within the context of Muscat’s established role as a regional and international mediator. During his meetings, Aoun praised Oman’s diplomatic standing and approach, describing it as “wise and responsible.” He commended Oman’s foreign policy, grounded in dialogue, mediation, balance, and good neighborliness, saying it had earned the sultanate a “distinguished status and a pivotal role in promoting stability and resolving conflicts through peaceful means.” Aoun said that, in Lebanon, “we hold this wise approach in high regard and deeply value the sultanate’s steadfast support for Lebanon in various international forums, as well as its support as we confront the challenges before us.” For his part, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq reaffirmed Oman’s continued commitment to Lebanon’s stability and its close monitoring of the latest developments in the country. He emphasized the deep-rooted relations between the two countries and the importance of strengthening bilateral cooperation and coordination.

{"title": "Anti-immigrant rhetoric, policies intensify across Europe", "body": "Anti-immigrant rhetoric and tougher migration policies are gaining momentum across Europe as immigration rises on the political agenda and right-wing parties increase their influence, according to an Associated Press report. In the UK and several European countries, overt hostility toward immigrants and ethnic minorities has become more visible. Tens of thousands marched in London this year, chanting anti-immigrant slogans, while senior politicians made controversial remarks about race and called for deportations of long-term residents born abroad, reports UNB. Right-wing parties advocating mass deportations and portraying immigration as a threat to national identity are polling strongly, including Reform UK, Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) and France’s National Rally. Analysts say rhetoric once confined to the political fringe is now central to mainstream debate. Experts link the growing polarization to economic stagnation since the 2008 financial crisis, the impact of Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and the amplifying role of social media. Immigration has increased over the past decade, driven partly by people fleeing wars in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine, though asylum-seekers make up a small share of overall migration. Racist language and hate crimes are also rising. Police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase. Lawmakers and minority politicians report escalating online abuse and threats. Violent anti-immigrant protests have also occurred in Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK, often targeting housing for asylum-seekers. Mainstream parties, while condemning racism, are adopting tougher migration stances. Britain’s Labor government has announced measures to make permanent settlement harder, while several European states are pushing to ease deportations and weaken migrant protections. Human rights advocates warn this risks normalizing increasingly extreme policies. Some centrist leaders have drawn criticism for echoing far-right language, fueling concerns that divisive rhetoric deepens social fractures. Analysts argue political leaders must consider how their words shape public attitudes, though many fear confrontational language is increasingly seen as electorally effective across Europe.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/anti-immigrant-rhetoric-policies-intensify-across-europe", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 322},

{"title": "NY moves to legalise assisted dying with safeguards", "body": "New York is set to legalize medically assisted suicide for terminally ill patients under an agreement reached between Governor Kathy Hochul and state legislative leaders, the governor announced on Wednesday. Hochul said she plans to sign the bill next year after securing added safeguards, or “guardrails,” to ensure the law is applied carefully. Writing in an op-ed, the Democratic governor said her decision followed conversations with patients enduring severe pain, their families, and people of faith who oppose ending life on moral grounds. The proposed Medical Aid in Dying Act would allow patients expected to die within six months to request life-ending medication. The request must be made in writing, signed by two witnesses to rule out coercion, and approved by both an attending physician and a consulting doctor. Additional provisions will require confirmation from a medical doctor of the patient’s prognosis and an evaluation by a psychologist or psychiatrist to ensure the decision is voluntary and informed. The bill also includes a mandatory five-day waiting period and both written and recorded oral requests to confirm free will. Facilities tied to religious hospitals may opt out, and the measure will apply only to New York residents. The law would take effect six months after being signed. Hochul described backing the bill as one of the most difficult decisions of her tenure, saying she could no longer deny terminally ill patients a choice they are pleading for at the end of life. The legislation, first introduced in 2016, faced years of opposition from religious groups, including the New York State Catholic Conference, which argues it undermines the sanctity of life and the role of physicians. Church leaders renewed their criticism after the announcement, warning it could endanger vulnerable people. Supporters say the law will ease suffering and allow terminally ill individuals to die with dignity.

The meeting was presided over by Abu Saud Masud, President of the Narayanganj Journalists’ Union. The program was conducted by journalist Billal Hossain Robin. The session began with a recitation from the Holy Qur’an by union member Monir Hossain. This was followed by a one-minute silence in memory of the martyrs of the Liberation War, those involved in the Movement of ’24, Sharif Usman Hadi (spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha), and all journalists who have lost their lives in independent Bangladesh. In his organizational report, General Secretary AKM Mahfuzur Rahman highlighted in detail the incidents of repression previously carried out against President Abu Saud Masud. Treasurer Moshtaq Ahmed Shawon presented the financial report. Both the organizational and financial reports were unanimously approved through members’ support and a show of hands. Members of the executive committee, along with general members of the Narayanganj Journalists’ Union, were present at the meeting. Speaking as chief guest, Obaidur Rahman Shahin said: your president Abu Saud Masud has stated that if anyone raises a hand against journalists, that hand will be broken within 24 hours. Adding to this, I want to say: if even one more case is filed against journalists, or even a single insulting word is uttered against them, we will firmly stand beside this registered Narayanganj Journalists’ Union.

The milestone came in the 86th minute via a penalty in a 2-0 victory over 10-man Sevilla in Madrid’s final match of the year. The France striker, celebrating his 27th birthday, marked the achievement with a subdued version of Ronaldo’s iconic celebration, before blowing a kiss to the cameras. Since joining Real Madrid in summer 2024, Mbappé has scored 29 goals this season, including 18 in La Liga. “It’s incredible, in my first full year to do what Cristiano did. He’s my idol and the best player in Real Madrid’s history,” Mbappé said. Sevilla struggled after defender Marcao was sent off for a second yellow, and coach Matías Almeyda was expelled during halftime for protesting. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois denied multiple scoring chances, keeping the clean sheet intact until Mbappé converted the penalty awarded after Juanlu Sánchez fouled Rodrygo.

{"title": "Four civilians killed in Afghan-Pakistan border clash", "body": "An overnight exchange of fire at one of the main Pakistan-Afghanistan border crossings killed four civilians, an Afghan official said on Saturday, in the latest flare-up since deadly clashes in October. Four others were wounded, Abdul Karim Jahad, the governor of Spin Boldak district in southern Afghanistan, told AFP. The local hospital at the Pakistani border town of Chaman said three people had been discharged after suffering minor injuries during the clash.Each side accused the other of launching “unprovoked” attacks. at the crossing between Chaman and Spin Boldak despite a truce agreed after the October clashes. “Unfortunately, tonight, the Pakistani side started attacking Afghanistan in Kandahar, Spin Boldak district, and the forces of the Islamic Emirate were forced to respond,” Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on social media platform X late on Friday. Pakistan said it was Afghanistan that had fired first. “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing” along the border, Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesman for Pakistan’s prime minister, said on X. “An immediate, befitting and intense response has been given by our armed forces.” Residents on the Afghan side of the border told AFP the exchange of fire broke out around 10:30 pm (1800 GMT) and lasted about two hours. Ali Mohammed Haqmal, head of Kandahar’s information department, said Pakistan forces attacked with “light and heavy artillery” and that mortar fire had struck civilian homes. Afghanistan and Pakistan have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control in Kabul in 2021. Security issues are at the heart of the controversy, with Islamabad accusing Kabul of harbouring militant groups, particularly the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), that launch attacks on its soil. The Taliban government in Kabul denies the allegations.More than 70 people were killed and hundreds wounded in the October clashes. That fighting ended with a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but several subsequent rounds of talks in Doha and Istanbul have failed to produce a lasting deal and the border between the two South Asian neighbours remains closed. Kabul accused Islamabad last month of air strikes in a border area that killed 10 people, nine of them children. Pakistan denied the claim. Pakistan’s foreign ministry warned on November 28 that, in light of “major” attacks on its soil, “the ceasefire is not holding”. Pakistan said this week it would partially reopen the frontier for aid deliveries, with the crossing at Chaman expected to be used by United Nations agencies. It was not clear when the deliveries will begin, but Zaidi, the Pakistan prime minister’s spokesman, told AFP that “aid deliveries are separate” and the latest clash would have “no impact on that decision”.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/four-civilians-killed-in-afghan-pakistan-border-clash", "date": "2025-12-07T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 446},
{"title": "Political risks, banking stress drive foreign outflows from stock market", "body": "Foreign investors pulled more money out of Bangladesh’s stock market in the first four months of the current fiscal year as political uncertainty and stress in the financial sector continued to dampen confidence. Net foreign investment in listed equities stood at minus $66 million between July and October of FY 2025-26, meaning overseas investors sold more shares than they bought, according to Bangladesh Bank (BB) data. The outflow marks a sharp deterioration from the same period a year earlier, when net foreign investment was minus $9 million. Market participants say the widening outflows reflect growing caution among foreign funds amid concerns over political stability, weak corporate governance and mounting pressure in the banking sector, particularly among institutions facing capital and liquidity constraints. Saiful Islam, president of the DSE Brokers Association of Bangladesh (DBA), said foreign investors are worried that stress in parts of the banking sector could spread more widely. “Only four to five banks are relatively stable, while the rest are under pressure,” he said, adding that confidence in financial stocks has weakened and risk appetite has declined. The central bank’s decision to merge five listed banks and move toward the liquidation of nine non-bank financial institutions, most of them listed, has added to investor nervousness and heightened concerns about asset quality, governance standards and regulatory oversight. Islam, also a director of BRAC EPL Stock Brokerage, said high inflation has hurt consumer spending, limiting the earnings potential of consumer goods companies. He added that the market lacks new and attractive listings, noting that no IPO has been approved in the past year despite repeated calls to deepen the capital market.Weak dividend records, poor corporate governance and limited communication with company management have further discouraged long-term foreign investment, he said. Meanwhile, Mohammed Rahmat Pasha, managing director of UCB Stock Brokerage, said uncertainty surrounding the next national election remains a key concern.“Until a democratically elected government takes charge, most long-term foreign investors prefer to stay away,” he said. Pasha also pointed to lingering concerns after the imposition of floor prices in 2020 and 2022, which made the market illiquid and hurt foreign investors, leaving a lasting impact on market credibility and foreign fund mandates.BB data show foreign investors withdrew $150 million in FY 2024-25, following $343 million in FY 2023-24. Brokers say foreign funds may return gradually if political stability improves, market rules remain predictable and corporate governance strengthens, alongside a steady pipeline of quality new listings and clearer policy signals from regulators. They added that restoring trust will also require consistent enforcement of rules, improved disclosure standards and sustained efforts to strengthen market supervision.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/political-risks-banking-stress-drive-foreign-outflows-from-stock-market", "date": "2025-12-22T00:08:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 434},

Having already made history by becoming the first Bangladeshi pair to reach the final of an international challenge event, Jumar and Urmi fell at the last hurdle on Saturday, 20 December, losing the final to a Malaysian pair in straight games.Despite a spirited fight in the opening game, the home favourites were beaten 27-25, 21-14, finishing runners-up.The final was played without any formal ceremony due to State Mourning Day over the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 student-led uprising. Players, coaches and officials observed the occasion by wearing black armbands, keeping celebrations muted. Even so, the significance of Bangladesh’s achievement was not lost.

{"title": "Trump set to expand immigration crackdown in 2026", "body": "US President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces – even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Trump has already surged immigration agents into major US cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status. ICE and Border Patrol will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 – a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July. Administration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status. The expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Miami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics. “People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as ?much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,” said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican political strategist. “There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.” Trump’s overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50 percent in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major US cities, to 41 percent in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue. Rising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining US citizens. ‘NUMBERS WILL EXPLODE’In addition to expanding enforcement actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants ?have been deported since Trump took office in January.White House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across the US-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.“I think you’re going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.Homan said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said US businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump’s immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.Pierce said it will be interesting to see “whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.”Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to US cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.Some businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors ?walk them. Some US citizens started carrying passports. Despite the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.Some 41 percent of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6 percent of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted. The Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of US citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.The administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the US economy and Republican-leaning business owners.Replacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress. Administration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.Some immigration hard-liners have called for more workplace enforcement. “Eventually you’re going to have to go after these employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/trump-set-to-expand-immigration-crackdown-in-2026", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 903},

On Shabnur’s birthday, Kanak Chapa seemed to recall many unknown things about that era through an emotional recollection of her. Kanak Chapa wrote, “Her (Shabnur) acting style, her accent, her physical beauty, her moon-like face, her rose-like smile and her eyes have captivated the entire youth community for several decades. Her hair has not cut yet, and will never cut. Only one in a hundred people possess such talent. There are many of her contemporaries but no one is close to her.” Kanak Chapa has sung almost all the songs in Shabnur’s acting career. The artiste said about this long journey, “I have sung 99 out of her 100 songs. Our two bodies can be said to be one soul. I sang like me, she acted like her. But when I saw it on screen, I couldn’t believe that I had sung the song! It felt like it was her voice.

When asked if transgender athletes should be eligible to compete in the women’s category, the Belarusian said: “That’s a tricky question. I have nothing against them.” She added: “But I feel like they still got a huge advantage over the women and I think it’s not fair on women to face basically biological men.” The four-time Grand Slam champion said: “It’s not fair.

{"title": "Iraq’s political future in limbo as factions vie for power", "body": "Political factions in Iraq have been maneuvering since the parliamentary election more than a month ago to form alliances that will shape the next government.The November election didn’t produce a bloc with a decisive majority, opening the door to a prolonged period of negotiations. The government that eventually emerges will be inheriting a security situation that has stabilized in recent years, but it will also face a fragmented parliament, growing political influence by armed factions, a fragile economy, and often conflicting international and regional pressures, including the future of Iran-backed armed grouLibraryps. Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani’s party took the largest number of seats in the election. Al-Sudani positioned himself in his first term as a pragmatist focused on improving public services and managed to keep Iraq on the sidelines of regional conflicts. While his party is nominally part of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of Iran-backed Shiite parties that became the largest parliamentary bloc, observers say it’s unlikely that the Coordination Framework will support Al-Sudani’s reelection bid. “The choice for prime minister has to be someone the Framework believes they can control and doesn’t have his own political ambitions,” said Sajad Jiyad, an Iraqi political analyst and fellow at The Century Foundation think tank. Al-Sudani came to power in 2022 with the backing of the Framework, but Jiyad said that he believes now the coalition “will not give Al-Sudani a second term as he has become a powerful competitor.”The only Iraqi prime minister to serve a second term since 2003 was Nouri Al-Maliki, first elected in 2006. His bid for a third term failed after being criticized for monopolizing power and alienating Sunnis and Kurds.Jiyad said that the Coordination Framework drew a lesson from Al-Maliki “that an ambitious prime minister will seek to consolidate power at the expense of others.”He said that the figure selected as Iraq’s prime minister must generally be seen as acceptable to Iran and the United States – two countries with huge influence over Iraq – and to Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani.In the election, Shiite alliances and lists – dominated by the Coordination Framework parties – secured 187 seats, Sunni groups 77 seats, Kurdish groups 56 seats, in addition to nine seats reserved for members of minority groups. The Reconstruction and Development Coalition, led by Al-Sudani, dominated in Baghdad, and in several other provinces, winning 46 seats.Al-Sudani’s results, while strong, don’t allow him to form a government without the support of a coalition, forcing him to align the Coordination Framework to preserve his political prospects.Some saw this dynamic at play earlier this month when Al-Sudani’s government retracted a terror designation that Iraq had imposed on the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group and Yemen’s Houthi rebels – Iran-aligned groups that are allied with Iraqi armed factions – just weeks after imposing the measure, saying it was a mistake.The Coalition Framework saw its hand strengthened by the absence from the election of the powerful Sadrist movement led by Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr, which has been boycotting the political system since being unable to form a government after winning the most seats in the 2021 election.Hamed Al-Sayed, a political activist and official with the National Line Movement, an independent party that boycotted the election, said that Sadr’s absence had a “central impact.”“It reduced participation in areas that were traditionally within his sphere of influence, such as Baghdad and the southern governorates, leaving an electoral vacuum that was exploited by rival militia groups,” he said, referring to several parties within the Coordination Framework that also have armed wings.Groups with affiliated armed wings won more than 100 parliamentary seats, the largest showing since 2003.Sunni forces, meanwhile, sought to reorganize under a new coalition called the National Political Council, aiming to regain influence lost since the 2018 and 2021 elections.The Kurdish political scene remained dominated by the traditional split between the Kurdistan Democratic Party and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan parties, with ongoing negotiations between the two over the presidency.By convention, Iraq’s president is always a Kurd, while the more powerful prime minister is Shiite and the parliamentary speaker Sunni.Parliament is required to elect a speaker within 15 days of the Federal Supreme Court’s ratification of the election result, which occurred on Dec. 14.The parliament should elect a president within 30 days of its first session, and the prime minister should be appointed within 15 days of the president’s election, with 30 days allotted to form the new government.The incoming government will face major economic and political challenges.They include a high level of public debt – more than 90 trillion Iraqi dinars ($69 billion) – and a state budget that remains reliant on oil for about 90 percent of revenues, despite attempts to diversify, as well as entrenched corruption.But perhaps the most delicate question will be the future of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of militias that formed to fight the Daesh group as it rampaged across Iraq more than a decade ago.It was formally placed under the control of the Iraqi military in 2016 but in practice still operates with significant autonomy. After the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 sparked the devastating war in Gaza, some armed groups within the PMF launched attacks on US bases in the region in retaliation for Washington’s backing of Israel.The US has been pushing for Iraq to disarm Iran-backed groups – a difficult proposition, given the political power that many of them hold and Iran’s likely opposition to such a step.Two senior Iraqi political officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly, said that the United States had warned against selecting any candidate for prime minister who controls an armed faction and also cautioned against letting figures associated with militias control key ministries or hold significant security posts.“The biggest issue will be how to deal with the pro-Iran parties with armed wings, particularly those… which have been designated by the United States as terrorist entities,” Jiyad said.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/iraqs-political-future-in-limbo-as-factions-vie-for-power", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 996},

However, “the group remains resilient” and Afghan authorities have not completely eliminated its hideouts in the north and east, the report said, estimating that is has around 2,000 fighters.Its leaders have also stepped up a recruitment drive “to establish a network of sleeper cells to further enhance their capabilities, as well as their ability to conduct attacks outside Afghan territory.”According to the Jamestown Foundation, a US-based think-tank, Azam hails from Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province which borders Pakistan and is considered an IS-K stronghold.He is described as a poet and writer whose work often appeared on social media platforms such as Facebook before joining IS-K in 2015.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/pakistan-arrests-senior-official-from-islamic-state-offshoot", "date": "2025-12-20T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 444},

{"title": "Syria’s Kurds hail ‘positive impact’ of Turkiye peace talks", "body": "Efforts to broker peace between Turkiye and the Kurdish militant group PKK have had a “positive impact” on Syria’s Kurds who also want dialogue with Ankara, one of its top officials said Saturday. Earlier this year, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) ended its four-decade armed struggle against Turkiye at the urging of its jailed founder Abdullah Ocalan, shifting its focus to a democratic political struggle for the rights of Turkiye’s Kurdish minority. The ongoing process has raised hopes among Kurds across the region, notably in Syria where the Kurds control swathes of territory in the north and northeast. “The peace initiative in Turkiye has had a direct impact on northern and eastern Syria,” said Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria’s northeast. “We want a dialogue process with Turkiye, a dialogue that we understand as Kurds in Syria… We want the borders between us to be opened,” she said, speaking by video link to an Istanbul peace conference organized by Turkiye’s pro-Kurdish opposition DEM party. Speaking in Kurdish, she hailed Turkiye for initiating the peace moves, but said releasing Ocalan — who has led the process from his cell on Imrali prison island near Istanbul where he has been serving life in solitary since 1999 — would speed things up. “We believe that Abdullah Ocalan being released will let him play a much greater role… that this peace and resolution process will happen faster and better.” She also hailed Ankara for its sensitive approach to dialogue with the new regime in Damascus that emerged after the ousting of Syrian strongman Bashar Assad a year ago. “The Turkish government has a dialogue and a relationship with the Syrian government. They also have open channels with us. We see that there is a careful approach to this matter,” she said. Turkiye has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF force that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of PKK, and pushing for the US-backed force to integrate into the Syrian military and security apparatus. Although a deal was reached to that end in March, its terms were never implemented. “In this historic process, as the Middle East is being reorganized, Turkiye has a very important role. Peace in both countries — within Turkish society, Kurdish society and Arab society.. will impact the entire Middle East,” Ahmad said.Syria’s Kurdish community believed coexistence was “fundamental” and did not want to see the nation divided, she said. “We do not support the division of Syria or any other country.

That is why we advocate for peace.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/syrias-kurds-hail-positive-impact-of-turkiye-peace-talks", "date": "2025-12-07T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 437},

{"title": "Myanmar junta’s shift from battlefield to ballots", "body": "From inside a military base last week, Myanmar’s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing announced who he wanted voters to pick in Sunday’s general election, nearly five years after seizing power in a coup.“He suggested that during the upcoming election period, voters should choose candidates who can cooperate with the Tatmadaw,” state-run media reported, referring to Myanmar’s powerful armed forces. The comments underline the junta’s attempts to hold on to power as it uses ballots to do what it couldn’t on the battlefield – cement its control over the country in the face of fierce armed resistance that has emerged since the coup, while gaining some international legitimacy for its rule. But analysts and diplomats say the aim of establishing a stable administration in the Southeast Asian nation is far-fetched since the civil war is still raging, and a military-controlled government with a civilian veneer is unlikely to win many backers overseas.“A new iteration of indirect military rule will do nothing to resolve the armed conflict or civil resistance, and Myanmar will remain mired in crisis,” said Richard Horsey, Senior Myanmar Adviser at Crisis Group.Voting will be held in two phases, on Sunday and Jan. 11, in only 202 of Myanmar’s 330 townships where the military has varying degrees of control. Dates for a potential third phase, counting or results have not been announced.The battle-hardened Tatmadaw has long dominated politics in Myanmar, which won independence from Britain in 1948, with a string of military chiefs running the country with an iron grip.Min Aung Hlaing joined their ranks in February 2021, when he ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on the unproven allegation of electoral fraud by her party, which had won the preceding years’ polls by a landslide.“The military is incapable of anything but cosmetic change that will not threaten their core interests of central control,” said David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst.Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, which won the last two general elections in 2020 and 2015, remains dissolved by the election commission, and many other anti-junta political outfits are not in the running.Six parties are competing nationwide, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party that has the largest slate of candidates and is tipped to win the polls, creating conditions for the junta chief to take a civilian role. “The USDP already has established political leaders within its ranks,” said political analyst Sai Kyi Zin Soe, suggesting that Min Aung Hlaing’s route to presidency may not be straightforward, although the general is expected to remain tremendously powerful.“While it is likely that a national leader will emerge from the military-aligned USDP, we have to wait and see if that leader will be Min Aung Hlaing,” he said.In a military-managed election in 2010, the Tatmadaw installed a former general as a civilian president, a move intended to oversee a tightly controlled political opening.President Thein Sein later launched reforms that surprised critics and supporters alike. These included freeing political prisoners, easing long-standing media censorship and overseeing the 2015 election that resulted in a transfer of power to Suu Kyi after his party lost the vote.But comparisons between the current situation and past processes can be flawed, partly because of the unprecedented violence that has ravaged Myanmar since the coup, as a popular armed resistance has combined with long-standing ethnic armies in the country’s borderlands to challenge the Tatmadaw.“Rather than stabilising the country, military-orchestrated elections are likely to intensify violence while failing to generate durable political or economic stability,” said Ye Myo Hein, a senior fellow at the Southeast Asia Peace Institute non-profit.The elections are also a move by Min Aung Hlaing and his brass to seek foreign legitimacy after being shunned by the international community in the wake of the coup, the analysts said.Although planned with the backing of key ally China, the junta is seeking to gather broader support for the elections, including from neighbours such as India and Thailand as well as the 11-member ASEAN bloc that has barred the ruling generals from its summits.Thailand’s foreign minister said last month that ASEAN would find it difficult to re-engage with Myanmar because the election was being held without the necessary “inclusive dialogue,” and also called for Suu Kyi’s release.The United Nations, human rights groups and many Western nations have been vocal in their criticism of the elections that the junta is carrying out with the help of a law that punishes dissent and under which it has charged hundreds of people.“Any meaningful election requires an end to violence and dialogue amongst all parties concerned,” Britain said at the UN Security Council this week. “And there are no indications that the planned elections will be perceived as free or fair.”The junta insists that the polls have popular support, denying that they are being conducted with coercion, force or suppression. “The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community,” junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told reporters this month, according to state-run media.“Whether the international community is satisfied or not is irrelevant.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/myanmar-juntas-shift-from-battlefield-to-ballots", "date": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 842},

{"title": "EU warns of response after US bars 5 Europeans over censorship claims", "body": "The European Union has warned it may take action against what it called “unjustified measures” after the United States barred five European nationals accused of pressuring US technology companies to censor American viewpoints. The warning came Wednesday from the European Commission after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced travel restrictions against the five, whom he described as “radical” activists linked to “weaponized” nongovernmental organisations. Among them is former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who previously oversaw Europe’s digital and social media regulations. Breton, a former French finance minister, clashed publicly last year with tech billionaire Elon Musk over content moderation and an online interview with Donald Trump ahead of the US election. In a statement, the European Commission strongly condemned the US decision, said it had sought clarification, and stressed it would act “swiftly and decisively” if necessary to protect the EU’s regulatory independence. French President Emmanuel Macron also criticised the move, calling it an attempt to intimidate Europe and undermine its digital sovereignty. Rubio said on social media that European ideologues had long tried to coerce American platforms into suppressing views they oppose, adding that the Trump administration would no longer tolerate what it called “extraterritorial censorship.” The Commission countered that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market in line with democratic values, insisting its rules ensure fair competition and user safety without discrimination or targeting any country.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/eu-warns-of-response-after-us-bars-5-europeans-over-censorship-claims", "date": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 233},

Batting first, the Renegades struggled to build momentum and finished on 145 for 9. While Tim Seifert (34) and Mohammad Rizwan (32) provided some resistance, regular wickets kept the innings in check. Rishad stood out for the Hurricanes, conceding just 21 runs in his four overs and picking up the key wicket of Jake Fraser-McGurk, maintaining pressure through the middle overs with tidy, disciplined bowling. The real damage, however, was inflicted by Chris Jordan, who ran through the Renegades’ lower order with a brilliant 4 for 19, earning both Player of the Match and Cricinfo’s MVP honors.In reply, the Hurricanes made light work of the target. After an early wobble at 38 for 2, Nikhil Chaudhary’s blistering 79 off 38 balls turned the contest decisively in Hobart’s favor. Ben McDermott played the perfect supporting role with an unbeaten 49, as the Hurricanes raced to 149 for 3 in just 13.5 overs.While the Hurricanes’ batting dominance sealed a comprehensive win, Rishad Hossain’s economical spell once again underlined his growing value in franchise cricket, even on a night dominated by big performances from his teammates.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/rishads-hurricanes-beat-renegades-in-bbl", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 221},
{"title": "$688m ADB loan to boost Dhaka-Cox’s Bazar rail connectivity", "body": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the government of Bangladesh have signed loan agreements worth $688 million to upgrade the Chattogram-Dohazari railway route, marking a major step toward improving the country’s southern connectivity and advancing regional economic integration. The agreements were signed on this week at the Economic Relations Division (ERD) in Dhaka. ERD Secretary Md Shahriar Kader Siddiky and ADB Country Director for Bangladesh Hoe Yun Jeong represented the two sides at the ceremony. Officials described the investment as a milestone for the national railway network, especially in linking Dhaka directly with Cox’s Bazar, a region experiencing steady growth in both tourism and trade. The development focuses on a 35-kilometre stretch of railway between Chattogram and Dohazari, considered crucial for achieving seamless rail connectivity along the Dhaka-Chattogram-Cox’s Bazar corridor. A 2.5-kilometre bypass line near Chattogram will allow trains to travel directly from Dhaka to Cox’s Bazar without stopping at the Chattogram station, saving travel time and improving operational efficiency for both passenger and freight trains heading to the coastal region. Authorities believe this will make rail the preferred mode of travel for visitors to the country’s premier beach destination. ADB said the project aims to improve the resilience and efficiency of rail operations while shifting passenger and freight movement from roads to railways. The Dhaka-Chattogram-Cox’s Bazar corridor currently carries a major share of the country’s transport activities and is also part of the Trans-Asia Railway network, linking Bangladesh with regional trade opportunities and opening wider access to global supply chains. The initiative will modernise infrastructure through track elevation, better drainage systems and advanced signalling, ensuring the line remains operational even during adverse weather. The tracks will be made ready for dual-gauge operations to support more trains, while 30 new energy-efficient locomotives will be procured to reduce emissions and operating costs. Three stations will be redesigned with safer, more inclusive facilities to improve passenger experience and encourage economic activities in nearby communities.Officials noted that once completed, the project will stimulate economic activities across Bangladesh’s southern belt.Cox’s Bazar, home to the world’s longest natural sea beach, is expected to receive a significant boost in tourism. The fisheries sector and small businesses along the corridor are also likely to benefit as access to key markets becomes easier and more affordable.The ADB has long supported Bangladesh’s efforts to improve transport infrastructure, which is seen as essential for sustaining economic growth amid rapid urbanisation and expanding trade. With more people and products moving every year, shifting to rail transport is being prioritised as a smart, greener solution to reduce congestion, cut costs and enhance safety.The government hopes the upgraded railway will eventually integrate with broader regional networks, helping Bangladesh take full advantage of cross-border connectivity initiatives that promise new opportunities for investment, employment and development.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/688m-adb-loan-to-boost-dhaka-coxs-bazar-rail-connectivity", "date": "2025-12-26T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 461},

He returned Lewis du Ploy for just 5 runs. But the opportunity he brought was ruined in the next over due to the cost of 18 runs by Tim Southee.

It will give the Trump administration tools to push back on the most “onerous” state rules, said White House AI adviser David Sacks. The government will not oppose AI regulations around children’s safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America’s goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, with firms pouring billions of dollars into the technology.The BBC has contacted AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic for comment.But the announcement has been met with opposition.The state of California, which is the home to many of the world’s biggest technology companies, already has its own AI regulations.California’s Governor Gavin Newsom, who is a vocal critic of Trump, issued a strongly-worded statement in response to the executive order, accusing him of corruption.“Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology.”Earlier this year, Newsom signed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit risks stemming from their AI models.States including Colorado and New York have also passed laws regulating the development of the technology.Newsom has said the law sets a standard that US lawmakers could follow.Other critics of Trump’s executive order argue that state laws are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level. “Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states’ basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,” said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.But having individual states craft their own laws has created a patchwork of rules that can be harmful to the American AI industry, said Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School.“It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws. However, that assumes that we will have a good federal law in place,” he told the BBC.The tech lobby group NetChoice celebrated the executive order on Thursday.“We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,” said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/trump-signs-order-to-block-states-from-enforcing-own-ai-rules", "date": "2025-12-13T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 437},

{"title": "Palestinian economy faces critical downturn", "body": "The Palestinian economy is undergoing a severe downturn, driven by Israel’s continued assault on Gaza, intensified restrictions on movement and trade in the occupied West Bank, and a sharp decline in both domestic and external financial resources. As the Palestinian government struggles to manage an escalating fiscal crisis, official data and expert assessments warn that the economy is approaching a critical threshold – one that threatens the continuity of state institutions and their ability to meet even basic obligations.A joint report by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), published in the Palestinian Economic Monitor for 2025, found that the economy remained mired in deep recession throughout the year. According to the report, gross domestic product (GDP) in Gaza contracted by 84 percent in 2025 compared with 2023, while GDP in the occupied West Bank declined by 13 percent over the period. Overall GDP levels remain far below their pre-war baseline, underscoring the fragility of any potential recovery and the economy’s inability to regain productive capacity under current conditions.The report documented a near-total collapse of economic activity in Gaza, alongside sharp contractions across most sectors in the West Bank, despite a modest improvement compared with 2024. It also recorded a decline in trade volumes to and from Palestine compared with 2023, while unemployment in Gaza exceeded 77 percent during 2025.Palestinian Economy Minister Mohammed al-Amour said Israeli authorities are withholding approximately $4.5bn in Palestinian clearance revenues, describing the move as a form of “collective punishment” that has severely undermined the Palestinian Authority’s (PA’s) ability to function. “The total accumulated public debt reached $14.6bn by the end of November 2025, representing 106 percent of the 2024 gross domestic product,” al-Amour told Al Jazeera.The minister said the debt includes $4.5bn owed to the International Monetary Fund, $3.4bn to the Palestinian banking sector, $2.5bn in salary arrears to public employees, $1.6bn owed to the private sector, $1.4bn in external debt, and $1.2bn in other financial obligations.“These pressures have had a direct impact on the overall performance of the public budget,” al-Amour said, contributing to a widening deficit and sharply reduced capacity to cover operational spending and essential commitments.All of that has led al-Amour to conclude that the Palestinian economy is undergoing “its most difficult period” since the establishment of the PA in 1994. Official estimates show GDP contracted by 29 percent in the second quarter of 2025, compared with 2023, while GDP per capita fell by 32 percent over the period. These figures align with a recent report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which concluded that the Palestinian economy has regressed to levels last seen 22 years ago.In response, al-Amour said the government was implementing an “urgent package of measures”.“The government is rolling out a series of actions that include strengthening the social protection system, supporting citizens’ resilience in Area C [of the West Bank], and backing small and medium-sized enterprises and productive sectors, particularly industry and agriculture,” al-Amour said.Official data show a sharp drop across nearly all economic activities. Construction contracted by 41 percent, while both industry and agriculture declined by 29 percent each. Wholesale and retail trade fell by 24 percent.The tourism sector has been among the hardest hit. Following the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, the Ministry of Tourism reported daily losses exceeding $2m, as inbound tourism nearly collapsed. By the end of 2024, cumulative losses were estimated at approximately $1bn.The Palestinian Economic Policy Research Institute (MAS), citing PCBS data, reported an 84.2 percent drop in hotel occupancy in the West Bank during the first half of 2024 compared with the same period a year earlier. Losses in accommodation and food services alone amounted to roughly $326m.Despite the downturn, al-Amour said the Ministry of Economy is focusing on sustaining the private sector, substituting Israeli imports across seven key sectors, developing the digital and green economies, and improving the business environment. He noted that about 2,500 new companies continue to be registered each year.Samir Hazbun, a lecturer at al-Quds University and board member of the Palestinian Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said repeated crises have hollowed out the economy.“Over the past five years, all economic sectors have entered successive crises, starting with the COVID-19 pandemic and followed by the war on Gaza,” Hazbun said. “Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been especially affected, exhausting the local economy and weakening its ability to recover.”Hazbun said preliminary estimates indicate tourism has suffered direct losses exceeding $1bn, alongside extensive indirect losses resulting from the paralysis of hotels, souvenir shops, travel agencies, tour guides and street vendors.He added that hotel investments alone are estimated at $550m, with no financial returns for owners, forcing many workers out of the sector due to the absence of job security and safety nets. Economic expert Haitham Daraghmeh described Palestinian debt as “accumulated debt that increases monthly”, owed to banks, suppliers, contractors, and the telecommunications and health sectors.“The withholding of clearance revenues is no longer a temporary financial crisis; it has become a factor of complete economic paralysis,” he said.With external aid frozen and domestic revenues at historic lows, Daraghmeh warned that the government was “no longer able to cover salaries or operational costs”.“The government is operating like an ATM, with no real capacity for investment or economic stimulus,” Daraghmeh added.Daraghmeh said World Bank reports warn that continued failure to pay salaries and meet obligations could trigger comprehensive economic collapse. While some countries, including France and Saudi Arabia, have pledged support, he said none of that assistance has materialised.He outlined three possible scenarios; the most likely is a continued gradual decline, driven by ongoing revenue withholding and shrinking resources. The second involves international intervention to prevent total collapse, particularly at a decisive political moment. The third scenario could see a conditional breakthrough, tied to European demands for financial reform, anticorruption measures, curriculum changes and elections.Taken together, the data and expert assessments suggest the Palestinian economy is approaching a dangerous tipping point. Analysts warn that without an end to revenue withholding, renewed international financial support, and a shift in the political context, the economy risks sliding from prolonged crisis into outright collapse.The question facing Palestinian officials and economists alike is how long the system can endure under siege-like conditions – and whether political and economic shifts will arrive in time to halt what many now describe as a slow and deliberate economic unravelling.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/palestinian-economy-faces-critical-downturn", "date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 1071},
{"title": "Govt welcomes Tarique Rahman’s return, assures full cooperation", "body": "Chief Adviser’s Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam on Wednesday said the government welcomes BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman’s scheduled homecoming on Thursday morning, affirming that all cooperation sought by his party is being extended with necessary security measures in place. “We welcome his return,” he told reporters while responding to a question at a media briefing at the Foreign Service Academy in the capital. In terms of security, Alam said, things are being looked after in consultation with BNP keeping in mind what the party wants. “From our part, we have the highest effort,” said the Press Secretary, stressing that required security measures have been taken from the government side. Senior Assistant Press Secretary Foyez Ahmmad was also present. Regarding youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi’s killers, Press Secretary Alam said the government is working with the highest priority in this regard.”We are getting some vital clues. We have the highest efforts to investigate the matter,” he said, referring to some arrests. After 17 years in exile, Acting Chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Tarique Rahman is poised to return home on Thursday morning (December 25, 2025), a moment the party describes as both politically significant and emotionally charged. BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed disclosed a detailed timeline at a press conference held at the BNP chairperson’s Gulshan office on Wednesday (December 24, 2025). According to the plan, Tarique Rahman will depart London’s Heathrow Airport on a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight, accompanied by his wife Dr Zubaida Rahman and daughter Zaima Rahman. Senior journalist Saleh Shibly and three personal aides will also travel with him. The aircraft is scheduled to land in Dhaka at 11:55am. From the airport, Tarique will proceed directly to a public reception arranged on the service lane of the 300 Feet Road, where he will deliver a brief address to supporters. To minimise public inconvenience and traffic congestion in Dhaka, Tarique Rahman alone will speak at the reception, said Salahuddin. After the programme, he will visit BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, who is currently undergoing treatment in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of Evercare Hospital, Bashundhara, to enquire about her health. He will then return to his designated residence in Gulshan. On Friday, following the Jumma prayers, Tarique Rahman will visit the grave of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman. He is also scheduled to pay tribute to the martyrs of the Liberation War at the National Memorial. On Saturday, Tarique Rahman will be formally registered as a voter. After completing the process, he will visit the grave of Osman Hadi near the Dhaka University Central Mosque. He will later go to the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Rehabilitation (NITOR), popularly known as Pangu Hospital, to meet those injured in the July 2024 uprising. Tarique Rahman was arrested during the caretaker government in 2007 and spent around 18 months in prison. After his release in 2008, he left for the United Kingdom for advanced medical treatment. Although he has been leading the party from abroad, his return now comes as he prepares to take a more direct role in party affairs after a long 17-year absence.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/govt-welcomes-tarique-rahmans-return-assures-full-cooperation", "date": "2025-12-24T20:35:32+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 521},

The garbage dump in the College Road area, in particular, has been one of the city’s problems for a long time. There are educational institutions, shops, and houses next to that location.

In this situation, last Sunday, students of Srimangal Government College, The Residential Model School and College, and Gausia Shafiqia Sunni Madrasa blocked the garbage dump on College Road with a bamboo barricade. They claim that they were forced to take this step despite a long-standing agitation without receiving a solution. Meanwhile, the upazila administration and the municipal authorities held an emergency meeting on Monday morning to resolve the situation after the incident. The meeting, held at the Gausia Shafiqia Sunnia Madrasa premises, was attended by students, locals, and the administration.

During the award ceremony, Norwegian Nobel Committee Chair Jørgen Watne Frydnes said Machado had made every effort to reach Oslo “despite facing extreme danger,” and assured attendees that she was safe and expected to arrive later. Her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, collected the prize in her place. In an audio message released by the Nobel Foundation, Machado said many people had risked their lives to help her travel and described the honor as recognition for all Venezuelans. She said she looked forward to reuniting with family and supporters she had not seen in two years. Several Latin American leaders, including Argentina’s Javier Milei and Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa, attended the ceremony to show support for Machado, who was awarded the prize for her push for democratic change in Venezuela. Machado won the opposition primary but was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, which later returned President Nicolás Maduro to power amid allegations of arrests, repression and rights abuses.

Following the incident in which five vehicles fell from the ferry and three people died, the district administration formed a nine-member investigation committee headed by Additional District Magistrate Naima Islam. The committee has been directed to submit its report within seven working days. Meanwhile, from Sunday afternoon, BIWTA began preliminary operations at the accident site, including measuring the river’s depth. BIWTA Assistant Director Md. Kamruzzaman said that once the depth measurement is completed, recovery operations for the submerged vehicles will begin in phases. During a visit to the site, investigation committee head Additional District Magistrate Naima Islam said the truck driver responsible for the incident has been absconding since the accident. “I have inspected the scene and met with the family of one of the victims. The investigation is ongoing. Efforts are underway to determine how the submerged vehicles can be recovered,” she said.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/5-vehicles-fall-from-ferry-3-dead", "date": "2025-12-22T00:08:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 374},
{"title": "Saudi increasingly concerned by Israel’s impact on regional instability: Experts", "body": "Experts on Wednesday noted Saudi Arabia’s increased concern over Israel’s regional conduct during a panel discussion hosted by the Middle East Institute and attended by Arab News. F. Gregory Gause III, professor emeritus of international affairs at the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University, said Israel rather than Iran has become the more immediate worry for the Kingdom. “I think there’s a real worry that post-Oct. 7 it’s the Israelis, not the Iranians, who might be the fomenters of instability in Syria, in Lebanon, even with the attack on Doha,” he said. Saudi Arabia’s priority is achieving “stability in the region,” and it believes that closer relations with the US can achieve that, he added. Former US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Michael Ratney said the Kingdom’s concerns have pushed it to seek closer ties to the US through President Donald Trump, who has been more responsive than his predecessor Joe Biden. During his recent visit to Washington, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman “got everything he wanted” for Saudi Arabia’s interests, Ratney said, adding that his priority is to make the Kingdom a lynchpin of regional stability. The Saudis “are more positive about the relationship with the US than I think a lot of people here realize,” Ratney said. “They genuinely want their entire strategic outlook anchored in the US.” Dr. Karen E. Young, a senior MEI fellow, said the Saudis have a growing concern for how regional instability impacts their economic advances under the Vision 2030 reform plan. “Certainly there’s concern for the neighborhood, but in new ways and more geared toward what instability in the region means for economic development, tourism, logistics, trade and even connectivity, whether it’s in trading and selling electricity or perhaps in the transfer of data,” she added. “So they need calm, and that means on both sides of the Red Sea.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/saudi-increasingly-concerned-by-israels-impact-on-regional-instability-experts", "date": "2025-12-19T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 309},

The bank will primarily provide loans to new micro-entrepreneurs and existing small enterprises designed to bypass conventional banking hurdles. The body was formed on Thursday at a meeting at the Financial Institution Division (FID) with its secretary Nazma Mobarek in the chair, after many sections of the draft have been found to be inconsistent with various existing acts and laws, sources said. Earlier, in May this year chief adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus at an event emphasized the need for establishment of microcredit banks to develop the rural and marginalized communities as entrepreneurs. The body, headed by Sayed Kutub, an additional secretary at the FID, has been asked to submit its report by next 15 working days to FID secretary for the further advancement of the draft ordinance.After the meeting, the committee head Mr Kutub told the media that the draft was at preliminary stage and the participants of the meeting found various inconsistencies in it.Thus the meeting has decided to form a committee to make the draft consistent with the other existing acts, he said.Earlier, the government drafted the Microcredit Bank Ordinance-2025 to establish a specialized bank for small entrepreneurs.Officials said the microcredit bank has been planned to provide collateral-based and non-collateral based loans to small entrepreneurs.According to the draft ordinance, 60 per cent ownership of microcredit banks will be held by the poor people.The proposed microcredit bank will be able to collect deposits from the common people, it said, adding that the bank will operate as a social business enterprise for employment generation and alleviate poverty.The bank will launch with an authorised capital of Tk300 crore, divided into shares with a face value of Tk100. The initial paid-up capital is set at Tk100 crore. A seven-member board will oversee operations, featuring three directors elected by borrower-shareholders and three by other shareholders.Senior officials of several large microcredit institutions have welcomed the government’s initiative.

Police said seven men and two women were killed in Bekkersdal, near Johannesburg, after about 12 unidentified gunmen arrived in two vehicles and opened fire at patrons.The shooting happened at about 01:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT Saturday) and the perpetrators “continued to shoot randomly as [people] fled the scene”, police added. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Sixty-three people were killed every day on average between April and September this year, according to police figures.Murders are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. The motive for this attack is not clear. At the scene, deputy provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Fred Kekana told broadcaster Newzroom Afrika that the perpetrators, armed with pistols and one AK-47, were “unprovoked”.“The poor patrons were just enjoying themselves when people came and shot,” he said. Two of the victims were shot outside the tavern as they tired to flee and a third was a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby, Maj-Gen Kekana added. Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, one resident described how gunfire had become a normal thing at night in Bekkersdal.“Criminals, they do as they please here,” the unnamed man said.“These guns, they sound each and every evening… as soon as it’s dusk we know that gunshots are about to sound and they will sound severely.“It is terrorising our communities.”There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners’ Association.Earlier this month, at least 11 people – including a child – were shot dead at a hostel near Pretoria.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/gunmen-kill-nine-in-south-africa-tavern-attack", "date": "2025-12-22T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 314},

{"title": "Nation celebrates Victory Day", "body": "Bangladesh celebrated its 55th Victory Day on Tuesday with solemn respect and festive enthusiasm, honouring the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War and remembering the historic triumph achieved 54 years ago through immense sacrifice and struggle. On December 16, 1971, the nation attained victory over Pakistani occupation forces, at the cost of the lives of three million martyrs and the dignity of more than two lakh mothers and sisters. The day’s programmes began in the morning with a 31-gun salute in the capital. At dawn, the national flag was hoisted atop all government, semi-government, autonomous and private institutions across the country, as well as at Bangladesh missions abroad. President Mohammed Shahabuddin and Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus paid their respects to the Liberation War martyrs by placing wreaths at the National Memorial in Savar early in the morning. Later, families of the Bir Shreshthas, war-wounded freedom fighters and valiant freedom fighters, led by the Liberation War Affairs Adviser, laid wreaths at the memorial. Members of the Advisory Council, senior state officials and foreign diplomats subsequently paid floral tributes at the main altar. The National Memorial was later opened to the public, enabling leaders and activists of political, social and cultural organisations, along with students from various public and private universities, to pay homage in an orderly manner. From early morning, people from all walks of life gathered at the memorial to honour the nation’s brave sons, transforming the altar into a vast sea of flowers. Political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the National Citizen Party (NCP), also paid tribute to the martyrs. In the evening, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus addressed the nation, stressing the importance of safeguarding the youth and ensuring a peaceful, festive and inclusive election through collective efforts to build a new Bangladesh, while resisting what he termed ill attempts by defeated fascist and terrorist forces. Victory Day was observed as a public holiday. On the eve of the occasion, both the president and the chief adviser issued separate messages paying homage to the martyrs of the Liberation War. To mark the day, major roads, road islands and key establishments in Dhaka and other cities were adorned with banners, festoons and colourful flags, while important buildings were illuminated. The government arranged a variety of programmes, including a three-day victory fair, parachuting displays featuring the highest number of national flags, band and acrobatic performances, cultural events, and recitation, essay-writing and painting competitions for children centred on the Liberation War. On Sunday, Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus also unveiled a commemorative postage stamp, along with an opening day cover and a canceller, at a ceremony held at the State Guest House Jamuna. President Mohammed Shahabuddin and his wife Dr Rebeka Sultana hosted a reception at Bangabhaban on Tuesday evening in celebration of the 55th Victory Day. A total of 7,218 guests—including 266 freedom fighters and family members of Bir Shreshtha gallantry award recipients—attended the reception held on the green lawn of the President House. Among the guests were Chief Justice Syed Refaat Hassan, Liberation War Affairs Adviser Farooq-e-Azam, Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, ambassadors and high commissioners of various countries, Supreme Court judges, the chiefs of the three armed services, senior political leaders, academics, business leaders, artistes, eminent citizens, journalists, and civil and military officials. President Shahabuddin, along with the chief justice, the Liberation War Affairs adviser, the CEC and the service chiefs, cut a cake at the VVIP enclosure to mark the occasion.

To commemorate Victory Day, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting published special supplements, while Bangladesh Television, Bangladesh Betar and other TV channels and radio stations aired special programmes highlighting the history and spirit of the Liberation War. Cinema halls nationwide screened Liberation War-based films free of charge for students, while documentaries on the war were shown at auditoriums and open venues across the country.

{"title": "US launches review of advanced Nvidia AI chip sales to China, sources say", "body": "US President Donald Trump’s administration has launched a review that could result in the first shipments to China of Nvidia’s second-most powerful AI chips, five sources said, making good on his pledge to allow the controversial sales. Trump this month said he would allow sales of Nvidia’s H200 chips to China, with the US government collecting a 25% fee, and that the sales would help keep US firms ahead of Chinese chipmakers by cutting demand for Chinese chips. The move drew fire from China hawks across the US political spectrum over concerns the chips would supercharge Beijing’s military and erode the US advantage in artificial intelligence. But questions have remained about how quickly the US might approve such sales and whether Beijing would allow Chinese firms to purchase the Nvidia chips. The US Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, has sent license applications for the chip sales to the State, Energy and Defense Departments for review, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the process is not public. Those agencies have 30 days to weigh in, according to export regulations. One of the sources, an administration official, emphasized the review would be thorough and “not some perfunctory box we are checking.” But under the regulations, the final decision rests with Trump.The start of the inter-agency licensing review has not been reported previously. The Commerce Department and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A White House spokesperson did not comment on the review, but said “the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.” BIDEN HAD BANNED ADVANCED AI CHIP SALES TO CHINAThe Biden administration had imposed a raft of restrictions on advanced AI chip sales to China and countries it feared could become conduits for smuggling into the rival nation, citing national security fears. Trump’s move represents a departure from that policy and a dramatic reversal from his first term, when he drew international attention by cracking down on Chinese access to US technology. Back then, he cited claims that Beijing steals American intellectual property and harnesses commercially obtained technology to bolster its military, which Beijing denies. Exporting large numbers of the chips to China would be “a significant strategic mistake,” said Chris McGuire, a former White House National Security Council official under President Joe Biden and senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. McGuire described the chips as “the one thing holding China back in AI.”“I cannot possibly fathom how the departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense could certify that exporting these chips to China is in the US national security interest,” he said. Led by White House AI czar David Sacks, several members of the Trump administration now argue that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia’s and AMD’s most-advanced chip designs. Reuters reported last week that Nvidia was considering an increase in production of the H200, the immediate predecessor to its current flagship Blackwell chips, after initial orders from China outstripped the current capacity. While the H200 chips are slower than Nvidia’s Blackwell chips at many AI tasks, they remain in wide use in the industry and have never been allowed for sale in China. Trump had previously opened the door to sales of a less-advanced version of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips, its cutting-edge offering, but backed away from the move and approved sales of the H200 instead.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/us-launches-review-of-advanced-nvidia-ai-chip-sales-to-china-sources-say", "date": "2025-12-21T00:02:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 579},
{"title": "Structural, technical barriers hinder climate risk insurance rollout: IDRA chief", "body": "Climate risk insurance (CRI) is becoming increasingly vital for Bangladesh, one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries, but structural, technical, and policy challenges have hindered its widespread adoption, officials said at a workshop on Monday. Speaking at the workshop on Enhancing Media Capacity on Climate Risk Insurance, held at the Economic Reporters’ Forum (ERF) auditorium, Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) Chairman Dr M Aslam Alam highlighted the immediate impacts of climate change. “It is no longer a future threat. It is already affecting our lives, food security, and health,” he said, citing rising temperatures, shrinking winters, and intensifying floods and cyclones. Dr Alam noted that CRI could protect vulnerable communities if barriers such as insurability, affordability, and moral hazard are addressed. He suggested parametric or weather-index insurance, which triggers payouts based on predefined parameters like river water levels or cyclone wind speeds, as a potential solution. However, he stressed that legal recognition, nationwide data infrastructure, and inter-agency coordination remain crucial for scaling up CRI. Bangladesh Bank Executive Director Hosne Ara Shikha emphasised integrating insurance with green finance and credit schemes, noting that 20 percent of bankable funds have been directed toward green initiatives with special focus on women entrepreneurs. Speakers including WFP’s Nurul Amin and Oxfam’s Dr Mohammad Emran Hasan underlined the importance of fast, reliable CRI mechanisms for climate-vulnerable families. Dr Hasan stressed, “Bangladeshis living in climate hotspots did not create the climate crisis but they pay the highest price.

Mediators are working to force the next phase of the ceasefire forward, al-Thani, whose country has been a key mediator in the war, said during a panel discussion at the Doha Forum conference in Qatar. Violence has subsided but not stopped since the Gaza truce took effect on Oct 10. “We are at a critical moment. It’s not yet there. So what we have just done is a pause,” al-Thani said. “We cannot consider it yet a ceasefire. A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces – (until) there is stability back in Gaza, people can go in and out – which is not the case today.” Talks on achieving the next stages of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the two-year war in the Palestinian enclave have been continuing. The plan calls for an interim technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza, overseen by an international “board of peace” and backed by an international security force. Agreeing on the makeup and mandate of that force has been particularly challenging. On Thursday, an Israeli delegation held talks in Cairo with mediators on the return of the last hostage held in Gaza, which would complete an initial part of Trump’s plan. Since the truce started, Hamas has returned all 20 living hostages and 27 bodies in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian detainees and convicted prisoners. Although fighting has diminished, Israel has continued to attack Gaza and demolish what it says is Hamas infrastructure. Hamas and Israel have traded blame for violations. On Saturday, the Israeli military said that its forces, deployed behind the so-called yellow line of withdrawal agreed in the ceasefire, had opened fire on Palestinian militants who had crossed the line, killing three.

There are six of us sleeping on one mattress, and we cover ourselves with our clothes,” he said.Jonathan Crickx, spokesman for the UN children’s agency who is currently in Gaza, told AFP night-time temperatures could drop to around eight or nine degrees Celsius.“The rains are heavy, and these families are living in makeshift tents battered by the wind, where they’re barely protected by a plastic tarp,” he said.Samer Morsi, a 22-year-old displaced Palestinian sheltering in the central area of Deir el-Balah, said he had “spent the night holding onto the tent pole so it wouldn’t fly away in the strong wind.”“We don’t know how to cope with these harsh conditions,” he added.“We are human beings with feelings, not made of stone.”Crickx also described “absolutely appalling hygiene and sanitary conditions,” saying there was a fear that preventable waterborne illnesses could spread.“There aren’t enough toilets, there are places — I saw some in Gaza City — where large pools of water are essentially open sewers right next to the displacement camps. So we’re especially concerned for the immediate health of the children,” he said.A ceasefire between Israel and militant group Hamas that took effect in October has partially eased restrictions on goods and aid entering into the Gaza Strip.But supplies have entered in insufficient quantities, according to the United Nations, and the humanitarian needs are still immense.The UN’s World Health Organization warned on Friday that thousands of families were “sheltering in low-lying or debris-filled coastal areas with no drainage or protective barriers.”“Winter conditions, combined with poor water and sanitation, are expected to drive a surge in acute respiratory infections,” it added.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/16-dead-as-heavy-rains-batter-territory-in-gaza", "date": "2025-12-14T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 633},

{"title": "NHRC ordinance changes undermine independence: TIB", "body": "Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has raised serious concerns over what it terms covert amendments to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Ordinance, warning that the changes have put the commission’s formation under bureaucratic control and weakened its independence. In a statement issued on Saturday, TIB said key stakeholders involved in drafting the ordinance were neither informed nor consulted about the amendments, demonstrating how bureaucratic rigidity and even deliberate obstruction has stalled the long-awaited reform process. The organisation alleged that the inclusion of the cabinet secretary in the selection committee was intended solely to ensure direct government control, reinforcing authoritarian practices rather than promoting reform. TIB described the move as a humiliating example of the government yielding to bureaucratic forces opposed to meaningful change. TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said that when the ordinance was first gazetted, TIB and other stakeholders despite identifying shortcomings had hoped it would pave the way for freeing the commission from bureaucratic dominance and aligning it with public expectations and international standards. “Yet within just a month, on 9 December, the selection committee once considered a safeguard against bureaucratic interference has been transformed into a tool of government control,” he said. He added that the long-standing ineffectiveness of the Human Rights Commission and other constitutional bodies in Bangladesh stems largely from excessive government influence, and that the latest amendment is part of a broader, coordinated effort to preserve the status quo. Calling the bureaucratic takeover of the selection committee and the government’s acquiescence deeply disappointing, Iftekharuzzaman acknowledged that the amendment includes a positive provision to establish a National Preventive Mechanism to prevent cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. “However, the mere inclusion of the cabinet secretary in the selection committee effectively negates any prospect of ensuring the commission’s independence, impartiality and effectiveness, and contradicts the spirit of that provision,” he said. TIB also criticised amendments that dilute the commission’s authority, noting in particular the replacement of mandatory language requiring authorities to report actions taken on the commission’s orders with optional wording such as “may be informed.” Such changes, it said, have stripped the ordinance of much of its positive potential. Describing the government’s position as “embarrassing,” TIB urged authorities to reverse what it termed a capitulation to an anti-reform bureaucratic clique. The organisation demanded the repeal of the amended provisions especially the inclusion of the cabinet secretary in the selection committee and a comprehensive revision of the ordinance. TIB further noted that Ordinance No 62, gazetted on 9 November, had excluded any bureaucratic representation on the selection committee, reflecting a shared understanding among stakeholders about past failures. In contrast, the amended Ordinance No 74, gazetted on 8 December, added the cabinet secretary without consultation—an action TIB said was aimed solely at consolidating bureaucratic control.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/nhrc-ordinance-changes-undermine-independence-tib", "date": "2025-12-14T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 456},

The JBCCI remains committed to supporting the implementation of the EPA, the trade body said in a statement. Earlier on Monday, Bangladesh and Japan finalized the principles of the EPA, which were announced through a joint declaration by the two countries. The development marks a major step towards the conclusion of a comprehensive economic partnership between the two nations, the statement added. The EPA aims to deepen trade, investment and services linkages and is expected to play a pivotal role as Bangladesh transitions from its least developed country (LDC) status in 2026. The agreement in principle reflects alignment on the structure and key provisions of the EPA, with formal signing to follow upon completion of the necessary legal and cabinet level processes in both countries. JBCCI said it actively supported the process by commissioning a policy study titled “Accelerating Japan Bangladesh EPA: Key Priorities and Strategies Ahead”, conducting a perception survey among JBCCI and Shoo Koo Kai (JCIAD) members, and engaging with public and private stakeholders to present research based recommendations for the negotiations. The chamber noted that issues raised by private sector stakeholders – including simplified rules of origin, increased market access for readymade garments, liberalisation of service sectors and regulatory cooperation – have been reflected in the structure of the EPA. Highlights of the agreed framework include immediate duty free access for 7,379 Bangladeshi products in the Japanese market, immediate preferential access for 1,039 Japanese product categories in Bangladesh, and liberalisation of more than 100 service sub sectors. JBCCI appreciated the efforts of the negotiation teams, including the Ministry of Commerce of Bangladesh, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, BIDA and the Joint Study Group, and acknowledged the contributions of its members.

We must bring the private sector and NGOs into a partnership with the government. It is a comprehensive plan that outlines where, in which sector, and how everyone will work,” he said.

{"title": "AFED urges visible security for election observers", "body": "The announcement of the national election schedule has brought widespread enthusiasm among citizens, despite a compressed timeframe that has kept political actors and stakeholders busy. Even so, the election atmosphere is gradually taking on a festive tone, speakers observed at a strategic communication workshop organized by the Alliance for Fair Election and Democracy (AFED). The two-day workshop, titled “Communication Strategies for Citizen Election Observers,” began on Sunday at the BRAC Learning Centre in Niketon, Gulshan. Participants emphasized the urgent need to ensure adequate security for citizen election observers, noting that observers often face intimidation or uncooperative behavior from candidates and their supporters. Speakers suggested that assigning armed guards to observers would be ideal. However, if that is not feasible, they stressed the importance of deploying visible security personnel to ensure observers can carry out their duties safely and independently. “Observer security is essential for a credible and transparent election,” participants noted. The workshop also focused on strengthening AFED’s internal and public communication mechanisms. Sessions addressed principles of credible communication, internal workflows, joint public messaging, proactive outreach, and the selection of a designated spokesperson. Key outcomes included agreement on a unified tagline, joint communication tools, and a mechanism for sharing election-related information among member organizations. The opening session was chaired by AFED board members, while technical sessions were introduced by Mette Bakken and Anastasia Wibawa. A number of civil society leaders attended, including Rebeya Begum of SDS, Mahbubur Rahman of Banchte Shekha, Taleya Rehman of Democracywatch, and representatives from DORP, FEMA, MSK, and other organizations. The workshop will conclude on December 15 with follow-up discussions and closing remarks by AFED board members.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/afed-urges-visible-security-for-election-observers-2", "date": "2025-12-16T07:20:54+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 271},

{"title": "Oil prices climb as US blocks Venezuelan tankers, eyes on Russia-Ukraine talks", "body": "Oil prices edged up on possible disruptions from a US blockade of Venezuelan tankers as the market waits for news about a possible Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Brent futures rose 65 cents, or 1.1per cent, to settle at $60.47 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 51 cents, or 0.9per cent, to settle at $56.66. That put Brent and WTI down about 1per cent this week after both crude benchmarks fell about 4per cent last week. In other energy markets, a recent drop in US gasoline futures to a four-year low cut 321- and gasoline crack spreads, which measure refining profit margins, to their lowest since February. “The (oil) complex is posting small gains in holding above lows established earlier this week as it awaits further guidance regarding Ukraine/Russian peace talks as well as fresh headlines out of Venezuela as to the potential impact of the apparent Trump tanker blockade,” analysts at energy advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note. As US President Donald Trump seeks an end to Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War Two, the onus was on Ukraine and Europe to make the next move toward peace. European Union leaders decided on Friday to borrow cash to loan 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine to fund its defense against Russia for the next two years rather than use sidestepping divisions over an unprecedented plan to finance Kyiv with Russian sovereign cash. Putin offered no compromise on Friday on his terms for ending the war in Ukraine and accused the European Union of attempting “daylight robbery” of Russian assets. Ukraine, meanwhile, struck a Russian “shadow fleet” oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea with aerial drones for the first time, an official said on Friday, reflecting the growing intensity of Kyiv’s attacks on Russian oil shipping. VENEZUELA BLOCKADEUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday told reporters that the United States is not concerned about an escalation with Russia when it comes to Venezuela, as the Trump administration builds up military forces in the Caribbean. Trump told NBC News in an interview that he was leaving the possibility of on the table.Uncertainty over how the US would enforce Trump’s intent to block sanctioned tankers from entering and leaving Venezuela tempered geopolitical risk premiums, IG analyst Tony Sycamore said. Venezuela, which pumps about 1per cent of global oil supplies, on Thursday authorized two unsanctioned cargoes to set sail for China, said two sources familiar with Venezuela’s oil export operations. A sanctioned tanker carrying some 300,000 barrels of naphtha from Russia entered Venezuelan waters late on Thursday, while three others also under sanctions either stopped navigation or began redirecting course in the Atlantic Ocean, ship tracking data showed.The US on Friday imposed sanctions on family members and associates of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as Washington ratchets up pressure on the Venezuelan president.US PRODUCTION WORRIES?The rig count in the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest US oil-producing shale formation, fell by three this week to 246, the lowest since August 2021, according to data from US energy services firm Baker Hughes.The rig count is an early indicator of future output.

{"title": "Machado to collect Nobel Prize in defiance of travel ban", "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is due to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Wednesday, in defiance of a decade-long travel ban imposed by authorities in her home country and after spending more than a year in hiding. However, her current whereabouts are unknown and it is unclear whether she will be able to attend at all. When she won the prize in October, Machado dedicated it in part to US President Donald Trump, who has said he himself deserved the honour. President Nicolas Maduro, in power since 2013, says Trump is trying to overthrow him to gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and that Venezuelan citizens and armed forces will resist any such attempt. Machado, 58, is due to receive the award at a ceremony at Oslo City Hall in the presence of King Harald, Queen Sonja and Latin American leaders including Argentine President Javier Milei and Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa. The ceremony starts at 1pm (1200 GMT).Should she not reach Oslo, the ceremony would still go ahead. When a laureate is unable to attend, a close family member usually steps in to receive the prize and deliver the Nobel lecture in place of the laureate. On Tuesday, Machado did not appear at a scheduled press conference, with the Norwegian Nobel Institute saying in a statement it was unable to say “when and how she will arrive for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony”. “I know that she wants to come and that she is en route but that’s all I know,” said Kristian Berg Harpviken, the institute’s director and permanent secretary to the award committee. “We will make sure that it’s a worthy ceremony that recognises this year’s laureate, casting a spotlight on the situation in Venezuela and the importance democracy has for peace,” he told public broadcaster NRK. Machado has aligned herself with hawks close to Trump who argue that Maduro has links to criminal gangs that pose a direct threat to US national security, despite doubts raised by the US intelligence community. The Trump administration has ordered more than 20 military strikes in recent months against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and off Latin America’s Pacific coast. Human rights groups, some Democrats and several Latin American countries have condemned the attacks as unlawful extrajudicial killings of civilians. Venezuela’s armed forces are planning to mount a guerrilla-style resistance or sow chaos in the event of a US air or ground attack, according to sources with knowledge of the efforts and planning documents seen by Reuters. In 2024, Machado was barred from running in the presidential election despite having won the opposition’s primary by a landslide. She went into hiding in August 2024 after authorities expanded arrests of opposition figures following the disputed vote. The electoral authority and top court declared Maduro the winner, but international observers and the opposition say its candidate handily won and the opposition has published ballot box-level tallies as evidence of its victory. Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said the Nobel prize had given “a strong signal of international validation … (of) the democratic results that had been forgotten”. He told Reuters it had also elevated Machado to “a person that … the international community and the world can hang their hopes on,” he said.“… Oftentimes democratic movements need a face. They need a story.”", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/machado-to-collect-nobel-prize-in-defiance-of-travel-ban", "date": "2025-12-11T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 562},

{"title": "Land acquisition begins", "body": "S A Shofiee, Sylhet : After much controversy, the land acquisition work for the Sylhet-Charkhai-Sheola four-lane project has finally begun. The district administration has started the important work of land acquisition in the wake of the sincere efforts of Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet Md. Sarwar Alam and the strong demands of the leaders of political parties and social organizations. This has brought relief to the public of the 4 upazilas of East Sylhet. The Roads and Highways Department is responsible for implementing this project, which was approved in the ECNEC meeting on April 11, 2023. It is learned that this project was undertaken to facilitate the movement of passengers and goods from Sylhet to Sheola Land Port. If the project is implemented, business and trade activities will increase in the four upazilas of Sylhet. The Roads and Highways Department will spend 4,257.7 million taka to implement the project. The World Bank will provide a loan of Tk 2,886.82 million for the implementation of the project. The government will provide the remaining Tk 1,370.25 million. A total of Tk 109.93 million has been proposed for various consultancy services in the project. Sheola Land Port businessman Kamar Uddin said that regular import and export of goods between India and Bangladesh takes place through this port. Especially stone, cement, fruits, and products of the Pran-Sajeeb group are exchanged. At least 200 heavy trucks ply this route every day during the peak season. But vehicles often get stuck due to the dilapidated Sheola Bridge. Business will be more brisk if a new four-lane road is built. Planning Commission sources said that if the project is implemented, the movement of passengers and goods from Sylhet to Sheola Land Port will be faster and easier. In addition, the expansion of regional connectivity with BBIN Corridor, SASEC Corridor, Asian Highway, BIMSTEC Corridor, BCIM Corridor, SAARC Corridor will increase trade and commerce activities, and will play a role in the country’s economic growth. The project involves the acquisition of 247 acres of land, construction of about 43 kilometers of four-lane roads, two service lanes, 1,575 consultant services, 31 culverts, three bridges, a flyover, six overpasses, two underpasses, four footover bridges, seven pedestrian roads and a toll plaza. Former Deputy Commissioner of Sylhet Sher A. Mahbub Murad recommended the cancellation of this project of such public importance. When the matter became known everywhere, anger arose throughout the eastern part of Sylhet. Upazila BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Sylhet Beanibazar Janakalyan Samity became quite active in implementing the project. Protests began with the submission of separate memorandums.

{"title": "Trump vows revenge after troops in Syria killed in alleged IS ambush", "body": "Two American troops and a civilian interpreter were killed in central Syria on Saturday after an alleged member of the Islamic State (IS) group opened fire on a joint US-Syrian patrol, officials said. “We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria,” US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social platform, vowing “very serious retaliation.” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the attack took place in Palmyra, home to Unesco-listed ancient ruins and once controlled by the IS group — also known as Isis — during the height of its territorial expansion in Syria. The deadly attack had been “an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman,” who was “engaged and killed,” US Central Command said on X. Trump called it “an ISIS attack against the US, and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them.” Three other wounded US troops were “doing well,” Trump said.The soldiers “were conducting a key leader engagement” in support of counterterrorism operations when the attack occurred, Parnell said, while US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said the ambush targeted “a joint US-Syrian government patrol.” The incident is the first of its kind reported since Islamist-led forces overthrew longtime Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad in December last year, and rekindled the country’s ties with the United States. Trump said Syria’s new President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who visited the White House last month, was “extremely angry and disturbed by this attack.”Syria’s foreign minister Asaad al-Shaibani said in a post on X that Damascus “strongly condemns the terrorist attack that targeted a joint Syria-US counterterrorism patrol near Palmyra.” “We extend our condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the American government and people, and wish the wounded a speedy recovery.” A Syrian military official who requested anonymity said the shots were fired “during a meeting between Syrian and American officers” at a Syrian base in Palmyra.A witness, who asked to remain anonymous, said he heard the shots coming from inside the base. However, a Pentagon official speaking on the condition of anonymity told AFP the attack “took place in an area where the Syrian President does not have control.” In an interview on state television, Syrian Interior Ministry spokesman Anwar al-Baba said there had been “prior warnings from the internal security command to allied forces in the desert region” of a potential IS “infiltration.” “The international coalition forces did not take the Syrian warnings of a possible IS infiltration into consideration,” he said. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor, which has a wide network of sources inside Syria, the meeting came as part of an “American strategy to strengthen its presence and foothold in the Syrian desert.” The official Sana news agency reported that helicopters evacuated the wounded to the Al-Tanf base in southern Syria, where American troops are deployed as part of the Washington-led global coalition against the IS group. Last month, during al-Sharaa’s historic visit to Washington, Damascus formally joined the coalition.IS seized swathes of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014 during Syria’s civil war, before being territorially defeated in the country five years later.

{"title": "BINDU discloses her separation after 3 years", "body": "Entertainment Report : Lux beauty and actress Afsan Ara Bindu married businessman Asif Salahuddin Malik in 2014. After marriage, she completely withdrew from showbiz. She left acting and became a family woman. After four years of marriage, there were rumours that Bindu’s family had broken up. However, neither Bindu nor her husband said anything about the separation at that time. Finally, the actress confirmed her separation. Bindu recently said at an event that she had separated in 2022. Although they separated in 2022, Bindu had been separated from her husband since 2017. After five years, they finally decided to separate. Bindu said, “Many people think that I am still married. But no, I’m divorced. My family journey was very short.” Explaining the reason for the separation, Bindu said, “Sometimes there are big reasons for separation, big events happen. Sometimes there is no need for such a reason. There is another person involved in this journey of mine. He also has a personal life. I don’t want to put him in an embarrassing situation by giving any explanation about the separation.” Bindu started her showbiz journey with the Lux Channel i Superstar competition in 2006. She became a regular face in the media in a short time. Before taking a break from acting, she acted in 52 dramas aired on Eid-ul-Azha in 2014 alone. Apart from the small screen, Bindu has also acted in movies. At the beginning of her career, Bindu paired up with Arifin Shuvoo and acted in many dramas. Their pair was very popular on screen. The on-screen chemistry had an impact on the real life of both of them. Once, Bindu was in a love relationship with Shuvoo. The actress has also admitted to that love. Why did their relationship break up? Bindu’s short answer was, “I don’t have the answer. There is no such thing as the journey of two people ending together at the same destination.” After a break of almost a decade, Bindu returned to acting in 2023 with the web film ‘Unish20’. In it, directed by Mizanur Rahman Aryan, Bindu was opposite Arifin Shuvoo. However, Bindu was not seen in any other work after that. However, she wants to act regularly. In this regard, Bindu said, “I am ready to work as an actress. Now I have to think about working with me, about investing in me. I want to do the kind of work that I have not done yet. I want the producers to think about me in a way that was not thought of before.” Bindu left acting and got involved in business about five years ago. She has a boutique house in Gulshan. Bindu designs the clothes of this brand called ‘Afsan Bindu Designer Studio’ herself. When Bindu started the company in 2020, she had only one employee. However, the actress said that now 15 people work with her, she said.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/bindu-discloses-her-separation-after-3-years", "date": "2025-12-23T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 482},
{"title": "Cambodia, Thailand hold first talks to end latest violence", "body": "Thailand and Cambodia have reported new fighting in their ongoing border conflict, as the first talks between the sides since the latest outbreak of violence get under way.Thailand’s military said on Wednesday that there had been clashes in the border provinces of Sisaket and Surin, Thai media reported, with Thai forces responding to Cambodian BM-21 rocket attacks with artillery, tank fire and drones. One Thai soldier was injured in the Pha Mo I Daeng–Huai Ta Maria area of Sisaket province, the Thai army said, before Thai forces returned fire, striking more than 19 Cambodian military targets.Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defence said Thai forces had carried out air attacks on Banan district in the northwestern border province of Battambang, hitting a civilian residential area with four bombs. Cambodia’s Ministry of Education also released a video showing what it said were scenes of panic at a school in the province, with students fleeing as the air raid was carried out.Further, the ministry said two civilians had been injured by Thai shelling in Banteay Meanchey province, the Khmer Times reported.The latest fighting came just before a meeting of defence officials began on Wednesday at the Ban Pakkad-Pailin border crossing between the countries.The talks are the first between the sides since renewed clashes broke out on December 7, killing more than 40 people and displacing about a million, according to official counts.The two sides agreed on Monday to hold the talks, within the framework of an existing bilateral border committee, the Cambodia-Thailand General Border Committee, following a regional push to end the fighting. Reporting from the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig said that the meeting was underway, with ASEAN countries acting as observers, but was not expected to yield any major breakthrough.“It’s very important to be clear about what this meeting is and isn’t. It’s between defence and military officials, not politicians,” he said.“This isn’t a forum where a ceasefire can be agreed or signed.”At best, he said, the talks would be about “stabilising the situation, clarifying incidents between the parties and keeping those lines of communication open”.Any agreement on a ceasefire would have to come from the political leaders in Bangkok and Phnom Penh, he said, “and that’s where outside pressure comes in.”The US, China and ASEAN countries had all been speaking to both countries, urging a resolution to the conflict.So far though, he said, “both sides are still locked in the blame game”.Thailand and Cambodia have engaged in daily exchanges of rocket and artillery fire along their 817km (508-mile) land border following the collapse earlier this month of a truce brokered by the United States and Malaysia that put an end to five days of fighting in July. The conflict stems from a territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800km (500-mile) border and a smattering of ancient temple ruins situated on the frontier.Each side has blamed the other for instigating the renewed fighting, claiming self-defence, while trading accusations of attacks on civilians.Meanwhile, a Cambodian official has accused Thailand of destroying a Hindu statue in a disputed border area, condemning the destruction of items of religious significance.Kim Chanpanha, a government spokesman in the border province of Preah Vihear, said the statue of Vishnu, built in 2014, was demolished by Thai forces on Monday.“We condemn the destruction of ancient temples and statues that are worshipped by Buddhist and Hindu followers,” Chanpanha said.Videos showing the demolition of the statue using a backhoe loader circulated on social media.The Thai military has not commented on the incident, but released a statement rejecting Cambodian claims that it was using cluster munitions intended to harm civilians.The statement said its cluster munitions were dual-purpose artillery shells used against military targets, in line with the principles of “military necessity” and “proportionality”.It added that the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), which prohibits signatories from using such weapons, was not applicable as neither Thailand nor Cambodia was a party to the agreement.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/cambodia-thailand-hold-first-talks-to-end-latest-violence", "date": "2025-12-25T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 654},

{"title": "Family members of peacekeepers mourn", "body": "Grief has swept through two villages in Kurigram and Gaibandha after young Bangladeshi soldiers were killed while serving with the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sudan. The fallen soldiers are Private Md Mominul Islam, 38, from North Pandul village in Ulipur upazila, and Private Shanta Mondol, 26, from Chhat Madhai village of Rajarhat upazila, Md Sabuj Mia from Palashbari upazila of Gaibandha. They were among six Bangladeshi peacekeepers killed in a drone attack carried out by an armed separatist group on a UN logistics base in Kadugli on Saturday afternoon. According to the Bangladesh Army, the attack took place at around 3:40pm local time in Sudan. The other victims hailed from Natore, Rajbari, Kishoreganj and Gaibandha. Back home, the news has left families shattered. In Chhat Madhai village, relatives and neighbours gathered at Shanta Mondol’s home as his wife, Dilruba Khandaker Brishti, collapsed repeatedly in grief. Five months pregnant, she struggled to accept the loss. “He promised me he would come back soon,” she cried. “Shanta cannot break his word. Bring my Shanta back to me.” Shanta joined the Bangladesh Army in 2018. His father, Nur Islam Mondol, is a former soldier, and his elder brother, Sohag Mondol, is currently serving in the army. Sohag said he had spoken to Shanta over a video call just hours before the attack.“Everything was normal,” he said. “Later that night, around 10:30, a neighbour told us something terrible had happened. After speaking to others in the mission, we confirmed that my brother was gone.” In North Pandul village, Mominul Islam’s mother, Monowara Begum, spoke through tears as she recalled her son’s last days at home. Mominul had joined the army 18 years ago and left for Sudan on November 5 after a short leave. “He trained for months before going abroad,” she said. “When he left, he hugged me and said, ‘Ma, don’t cry. I will come back very soon.’ On Saturday morning, he even spoke to family members on a video call. A few hours later, he was killed.” “My son harmed no one,” she added. “Why did they have to kill him?”Kurigram Deputy Commissioner Annpurna Debnath described the deaths as deeply tragic and said the district stood in solidarity with the bereaved families.News of Sabuj Mia’s death has plunged Palashbari into deep mourning, with family members and villagers struggling to accept the loss. Sabuj, from Chhoto Bhagabanpur village under Mahadipur Union, was the son of the late Habibur Rahman and Sakina Begum. Orphaned at the age of two, he grew up in poverty and worked hard to support his family. He left for Sudan on 7 November to serve with the UN peacekeeping mission, working as a civilian laundry worker with the Bangladesh Army. His sudden death has left his mother Sakina Begum and wife Nupur Akhter inconsolable. Nupur said she last spoke to her husband on Saturday afternoon and received the news of his death later that night. Tearful and distraught, Sabuj’s mother has appealed for her son’s body to be brought home so she can find peace. Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions worldwide. The deaths in Sudan have once again highlighted the risks faced by Bangladeshi soldiers serving far from home, and the heavy price their families sometimes pay.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/family-members-of-peacekeepers-mourn", "date": "2025-12-15T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 546},

The approvals came from the 51st meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase in this year held today at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat with Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed in the chair. The meeting recommended approval of two proposals from the Ministry of Food. Under the decisions, 50,000 metric tons of non-basmati parboiled rice will be procured through international open tender method from India with around Taka 217.53 crore, while another 50,000 metric tons of white rice will be imported from Pakistan under a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement with around Taka 241.52 crore. Officials said the measures would help maintain adequate public food stocks and curb market volatility during Ramadan, when demand for essential commodities rises significantly. The Directorate General of Food will implement the procurement, ensuring timely arrival of consignments to strengthen buffer stocks. Besides, in a move aimed at keeping edible oil prices stable during the holy month of Ramadan, the government has approved separate proposals to procure 4.75 crore litres of edible oil, including soybean oil and rice bran oil. Under the decisions, the government will procure 1 crore litres of refined rice bran oil locally while 3.75 crore litres of soybean oil from international sources under direct purchase methods. Officials said the procurement would help maintain adequate supply in the domestic market and prevent price hikes during Ramadan, when consumption of edible oil increases sharply. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) is expected to play a key role in distributing the oil through subsidised sales across the country. Meanwhile, the day’s meeting also approved the procurement of 10,000 metric tons of lentils through national open tender method with around Taka 72.20 crore to meet rising consumer demand during the holy month of Ramadan.

{"title": "It’s wise to remain silent in all situations", "body": "Entertainment Report : Rukaiya Jahan Chamak is a familiar face of the small screen. She has won the hearts of the audience in a short time with her acting and beauty. Since the beginning of her career, she has been known for her blunt nature and outspokenness. However, this time, the actress has changed her tune a bit. In a status on social media, Chamak said that staying silent is probably the most intelligent thing to do in this current situation. In a post on her Facebook handle, Chamak wrote, “In this country, staying silent is the smartest thing to do. Those who protest injustice are fools. From today onwards, I will wear a saree and post romantic pictures.” The actress is basically pointing to the ongoing unrest in society and the attitude towards protestors. According to Chamak, where speaking the truth or protesting injustice is seen as foolishness, it is better to withdraw. So, she has decided that from now on, instead of talking about social or contemporary issues, she will spend her time posting only glamorous and romantic pictures of herself. Fans have also given their reactions under the post of the actress. Many agreed with her arrogant decision. One wrote, “That would be the smart thing to do in the current situation.” Others said they were looking forward to her next work.", "url": "https://dailynewnation.com/its-wise-to-remain-silent-in-all-situations", "date": "2025-12-24T00:01:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "Daily New Nation", "token_count": 225},
