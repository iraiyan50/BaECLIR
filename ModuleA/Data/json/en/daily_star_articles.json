Speaking at an Iftar party BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said the verdict of the people will not be truly reflected in the polls unless and until the Election Commission is reorganised. He said the government should accept the demands placed by the opposition political parties. \"If you have the courage and sincerity, reform the controversial Election Commission before the polls,\" Bhuiyan told the government. Otherwise elections will be resisted, he added. BNP led opposition alliance, Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikkya Jote on Wednesday gave a 30-day ultimatum to accept their 4-point demand including removal of CEC.

In his speech Mannan Bhuiyan urged the government to \"shun vindictive politics or face dire consequences.\" He also announced a party programme to hold protest rallies at district and thana headquarters on August 3 to protest the alleged government move to change the name of Zia International Airport. The BNP Secretary General alleged, \"The AL has forcibly occupied the Surya Sen Hall of the Dhaka University, the Baitul Mokarram national mosque, the Eden Girls' University College and then the Zia International Airport.\" \"None can remove Shaheed Zia's name from the national history ... Zia led the country's War of Independence at a time when the AL leaders fled to India. The freedom-loving people will remember him for ever\", he said. \"AL would have no existence had Zia not allowed its rebirth and provided security to its leaders,\" he commented. \"Zia himself did not put his name anywhere. It's only after his assassination, two things (Zia International Airport and the Zia Fertilizer Factory) were named after him\", he said. KM Obaidur Rahman who was the civil aviation minister when the airport was named after Zia, narrated how the airport was named after Zia. Abul Hasnat said the name of Zia International Airport was taken in a cabinet meeting after the assassination of Ziaur Rahman in 1981. Later, a resolution was adopted unanimously in parliament. No member from the then opposition Awami League had raised any objection to the resolution, he added. The meeting over, leaders and workers of BNP and its front organisations brought out a procession chanting anti-government slogans.

The talks had failed because Tullow, which was offered blocks 9 and 11 by the government, did not accept a number of proposals made by Chevron-Texaco regarding partnership in Block 9, the most prospective among the 12 blocks now being negotiated by different foreign companies. In their alternative proposal, Chevron-Texaco suggested that Tullow be an 'operator' in this block and the equity ratio be Tullow-30 per cent, Chevron-30 per cent, Texaco-30 per cent and BAPEX-10 per cent. BAPEX, the subsidiary of Petrobangla, which participated in the second round bidding for oil and gas exploration but was never invited for any discussion, was included as a \"minor partner\" in the proposal as suggested by the government. On January 26, Tullow disagreed to Chevron-Texaco's equity formula under which Chevron would get 35 per cent, Taxaco-35 per cent, Tullow-20 per cent and BAPEX-10 per cent. The Irish company had also rejected the US joint venture's suggestion that Tullow and Chevron-Texaco be \"joint operators\" in this block. Tullow wants to be the \"sole operator\" in this block. The revised proposal will now be discussed by the high powered Investment Committee headed by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister. The Investment Committee guides the Negotiation Committee of the Energy Ministry. Although Tullow is only a 5.8 million Irish pound company, the government has been favouring it by offering two blocks since the negotiations began on October 22. Since Tullow appears to be financially \"not sound\" to carry out its proposals in these two blocks, the government has been trying to find a \"big\" partner for it. In December, Malaysian company Petronas and US company Mobil jointly accepted the government's offer to talk with Tullow regarding partnership in both the blocks. However, the government changed its position when Chevron-Texaco came in to sit with Tullow over Block 9 and suggested Petronas-Mobil to discuss Block 11 only. Oil giant Shell and its partner Cairn also kept its door open for partnership in both the blocks. Sources said that while the whole negotiation process was being delayed due the government's \"stubborn\" attempt to find Tullow a partner, growing interest by other big companies has now put Tullow in a strong position. Meanwhile, sources said that a lobby having very high level political connection was offering different companies its \"service to confirm other blocks in exchange of commission.\" According to a source, it was being suggested to different foreign companies to contact certain political appointees of the government to get their desired block.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/chevron-texacos-new-proposal-for-tullow", "date": "1998-02-03T00:00:26+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 455},

{"title": "EU for averting Iraq war", "body": "The United States Friday ordered another 35,000 troops to the Gulf despite pleas from European allies to avoid war with Iraq. US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signed deployment orders for the new wave of reinforcements, which will include marines and more fighter aircraft, a senior US official said. The deployments come on top of 25,000 troops Rumsfeld ordered deployed to the Gulf just before Christmas. And Secretary of State Colin Powell reiterated that the United States was resolved to disarm Iraq through military means if necessary, with or without UN approval. \"I think the international community...has spoken clearly,\" Powell said after meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohammed ElBaradei. \"Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction. And if it isn't accomplished peacefully...then I think the Security Council has to take the action that's indicated and determine whether or not force is appropriate.\" President George W. Bush has \"made it clear that we reserve the right...in the absence of international action to disarm Iraq, to act with like-minded nations to disarm Iraq. And we are positioning ourselves for whatever eventuality might occur,\" Powell said. Earlier this week, British Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon announced plans to deploy a force comprising 3,000 marine commandos and called up 1,500 reservists in readiness for possible war against Iraq. Hoon said as long as Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions was in doubt, the threat of force \"must remain and it must be real.\" However, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw spoke more moderately, saying, after talks in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur that Britain was committed to acting through the UN Security Council before being involved in any war. After weeks of procrastinating, Turkey reluctantly gave the US military buildup a boost by agreeing to have its air bases and ports examined for possible use during any military conflict. Turkey fears war in neighbouring Iraq would send its cripple its economy and stoke independence ambitions of its restive Kurdish population, which, with Iraqi Kurds forms the core of the Iraqi opposition. In an apparent attempt to make clear it was not alienating itself from Iraq, Turkey's state minister for external trade, Kursat Tuzmen, arrived in Baghdad with 350 Turkish businessmen to talk bilateral trade. But many allies, particularly in Europe, are worried about moves toward conflict. Another report says, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to hold talks with US President George W. Bush and chief UN arms inspector Hans Blix \"to prevent early military action in Iraq becoming inevitable\", the Times reported Saturday. Blair is expected to fly to Washington towards the end of this month to deliver a message that the United Nations should be given \"time and space\" to deal with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the British daily said. The prime minister also hopes to speak with Blix, possibly in London, before the weapons inspector delivers his assessment of Iraq's compliance with UN disarmament demands on January 27.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/eu-for-averting-iraq-war", "date": "2003-01-12T00:00:08+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 489},

{"title": "Neanderthal big eyes 'caused demise'", "body": "The Neanderthal skull (L) has larger eye sockets compared with a modern human skull (R). Consequently, the now extinct species used more of its brain to process visual information. Photo: BBC Online A study of Neanderthal skulls suggests that they became extinct because they had larger eyes than our species. As a result, more of their brains were devoted to seeing in the long, dark nights in Europe, at the expense of high-level processing. By contrast, the larger frontal brain regions of Homo sapiens led to the fashioning of warmer clothes and the development of larger social networks. The study is published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Neanderthals are a closely related species of human that lived in Europe from around 250,000 years ago. They coexisted and interacted briefly with our species until they went extinct about 28,000 years ago, in part due to an ice age. The research team explored the idea that the ancestor of Neanderthals left Africa and had to adapt to the longer, darker nights and murkier days of Europe. The result was that Neanderthals evolved larger eyes and a much larger visual processing area at the backs of their brains. The humans that stayed in Africa, on the other hand, continued to enjoy bright and beautiful days and so had no need for such an adaption. Instead, these people, our ancestors, evolved their frontal lobes, associated with higher-level thinking, before they spread across the globe. Eiluned Pearce of Oxford University decided to check this theory. She compared the skulls of 32 Homo sapiens and 13 Neanderthals. Pearce found that Neanderthals had significantly larger eye sockets - by an average of 6mm from top to bottom. Although this seems like a small amount, she said that it was enough for Neanderthals to use significantly more of their brains to process visual information. \"Since Neanderthals evolved at higher latitudes, more of the Neanderthal brain would have been dedicated to vision and body control, leaving less brain to deal with other functions like social networking,\" she told BBC News. This is a view backed by Prof Chris Stringer, who was also involved in the research and is an expert in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London. \"We infer that Neanderthals had a smaller cognitive part of the brain and this would have limited them, including their ability to form larger groups. If you live in a larger group, you need a larger brain in order to process all those extra relationships,\" he explained. The Neanderthals' more visually-focused brain structure might also have affected their ability to innovate and to adapt to the ice age that was thought to have contributed to their demise. There is archaeological evidence, for example, that the Homo sapiens that coexisted with Neanderthals had needles that they used to make tailored clothing. This would have kept them much warmer than the wraps thought to have been worn by Neanderthals. Prof Stringer said that all these factors together might have given our species a crucial advantage that enabled us to survive. \"Even if you had a small percent better ability to react quickly, to rely on your neighbours to help you survive and to pass on information - all these things together gave the edge to Homo sapiens over Neanderthals, and that may have made a difference to survival.\" The finding runs counter to the idea that Neanderthals were not the stupid, brutish creatures portrayed in Hollywood films; they may well have been as intelligent as our species. Oxford University's Prof Robin Dunbar, who supervised the study, said that the team wanted to avoid restoring the stereotypical image of Neanderthals. \"They were very, very smart, but not quite in the same league as Homo sapiens,\" he told BBC News. \"That difference might have been enough to tip the balance when things were beginning to get tough at the end of the last ice age,\" he said. Up until now, researchers' knowledge of Neanderthals' brains has been based on casts of skulls. This has given an indication of brain size and structure, but has not given any real indication of how the Neanderthal brain functioned differently from ours. The latest study is an imaginative approach in trying to address this issue. Previous research by Pearce has shown that modern humans living at higher latitudes evolved bigger vision areas in the brain to cope with lower light levels. There is no suggestion though that their higher cognitive abilities suffered as a consequence. Studies on primates have shown that eye size is proportional to the amount of brain space devoted to visual processing. So the researchers made the assumption that this would be true of Neanderthals.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/neanderthal-big-eyes-caused-demise", "date": "2013-03-14T13:58:16+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 783},

Hoggard also bowled Brad Haddin (28) in an accurate opening spell. Simon Katich made 36 off 47 balls before he was bowled in Ian Blackwell's first over. That paved the way for Waugh to enter the fray just as a southerly change came through, threatening rain. Conditions darkened and the temperature dropped but rain stayed away long enough for Waugh to unfurl superb strokes, including three sixes and three fours. He and Tasmanian Jamie Cox forged a century stand from 93 balls, as Waugh's team reached 200 for three wickets in the 33rd over. Cox (49) hit five fours and a six in his 60-ball stay. Earlier, Owais Shah -- overlooked by England for the World Cup starting next month -- scored 127 to anchor England's innings. Opening the innings, Shah survived a tough early period, and was dismissed in the 48th over after facing 154 balls. He hit nine fours and two sixes before he was caught on the boundary by Stuart MacGill off part-time bowler Greg Mail, who bowled at the end of the innings for an impressive return of 2-11 from three overs. Shah needed 81 balls to reach 50, but scored his last 77 runs off 73 balls. England blasted 91 runs off the final 10 overs, thanks mainly to Shah and Adam Hollioake, who hit a quick half-century to add 105 off 83 balls. England left out the bulk of their Test players, with Robert Key and Hoggard the only players from the victorious fifth Test side backing up two days later.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bradman-xi-too-beat-eng", "date": "2003-01-09T00:00:46+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 501},

Fullback Cafu captained the team which won an unprecedented fifth World Cup in Japan and South Korea last year. Parreira, who led Brazil to their fourth World Cup win in 1994, was recalled for a third stint in charge of the team last week to replace Luiz Felipe Scolari, who resigned in August. Brazil have also brought back veteran Mario Zagallo as technical director. Zagallo, 71, was Parreira's assistant in 1994 and coached the team in his own right at the 1970, 1974 and 1998 World Cups.

Prior to meeting the officials, the delegation held a three-hour meeting with the Federation leaders. But the ministry's reaction was not yet known, sources in the boards' delegation told The Daily Star last night. The delegation which is mediating between the Ministry and the Federation will hold another meeting with the Federation leaders this morning on the basis of the ministry's reaction, they said. When contacted, a high official of the ministry said, \"The demand put forward as a precondition to call off the strike is not logical.\"\"Offer for direct talks between the Federation leaders and the Ministry officials is still open,\" said an authoritative source in the ministry. \"They may avail the opportunity if they want.\"The boards' delegation comprised the chairmen of Dhaka, Rajshahi, Jessore, Comilla and Chittagong education boards, the chairman of Technical Education Board, controllers of Dhaka and Jessore education boards, Deputy Controller of Rajshahi Board and the Secretary of the Text Book Board. During talks with the boards' delegation, the Federation was represented by its President Amjad Hossain Bakshi, an employee of Dhaka Board, Secretary Syed Makbool Ahmed of Comilla Board, vice presidents Haroon Bhuiyan of Technical Education Board, Ansar Ali of Jessore Board, Amir Hossain of Madrassah Board and Joint Secretary of the Federation Mohammad Abdul Hanif Khan of Dhaka Board. The employees of eight boards went on an indefinite strike at the call of the Federation demanding cancellation of the TF report that brought corruption charges against some officials and employees of the boards, an end to \"attempts\" to curtail the autonomy of the boards, transfer of the centralised computer cells to the respective boards and stoppage of intervention in board matters by the Ministry of Education. Meanwhile, the Federation of Bangladesh University Teachers Association in a statement yesterday urged the employees of the boards to call off their strike for smooth holding of SSC and HSC examinations on schedule. \"The fate of the examinees has become uncertain as the talks between the ministry officials and the leaders of the board employees have failed,\" the statement said.

The policies, drawn up for five years, are almost at final stage and likely to be declared shortly, hopefully within a couple of months, Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed told UNB in an interview yesterday. For the first time, he said, the import policy would contain a section describing its overall objectives and ensuring easy import of raw material and machinery for the export-oriented industries. \"We are also in favour of liberalisation, but we'd adjust tariff rates looking into the interest of our domestic industry...We'd not rush into trade liberalisation as was done by our predecessor,\" he said. The export policy, on the other hand, is being formulated eyeing on a rapid export growth _ at least 20 per cent each year during the next five fiscals-and further diversification of exports. \"Our topmost priority is to increase the export earnings at a faster pace,\" said Tofael, flanked by Commerce Secretary Syed Alamgir Farrouk Chowdhury and other officials at his Secretariat office. Added the minister: We will do our best to increase the exports ... We will give the maximum facilities to the exporters. Speaking in favour of drawing up the policies for five years, the minister said a long-term policy always encourages an entrepreneur as it helps in making decision, specially in investment purpose. The commerce secretary said there would be some 20-30 specific changes in the import policy, framed after detailed discussions with the business organisations. Chowdhury said the policy planners were thinking whether the list of import-restricted items could be shortened or the import of second-hand machinery be allowed under the new import policy. Asked about the problem in getting the generalised system of preference (GSP) from the European countries, the minister said the European Union agreed to resume GSP with two-stage derogation if the \"fake\" certificates were cancelled. \"We are still trying to solve the problem without cancelling the certificates. We are yet to take any decision in this respect,\" he said. Asked whether any special step would be taken for the readymade garments, leather and shrimp industries that experienced a slowdown, he said he would discuse the problems of the industries with ministries concerned for their solution. He said he would hold talks with the finance minister within a couple of days about the problem of leather and jute industries.

{"title": "Kamaruzzaman's trial at final stage", "body": "The trial of war crimes accused Jamaat-e-Islami leader Muhammad Kamaruzzaman is set to enter the final stage as the International Crimes Tribunal-2 yesterday fixed next Sunday for beginning of the closing arguments of the case. The three-member tribunal led by Justice Obaidul Hassan with members Justice Md Mozibur Rahman Miah and Judge M Shahinur Islam fixed the date as the defence for the third consecutive date yesterday failed to produce their last witness. The court, however, gave another chance to the defence saying it would allow their witness if they could produce him/her on Sunday. As per relevant laws, after hearing the closing arguments from both the prosecution and the defence, the tribunal will set a date for delivering the verdict. Meanwhile, the tribunal directed the police to submit an execution report by April 10 on the arrest warrant it had issued earlier against three Jamaat leaders in connection with a contempt of court rule. The court gave the directive after the defence of Selim Uddin, one of the three Jamaat leaders who was arrested following the arrest warrant, submitted explanation to the tribunal over the rule issued on February 7. KAMARUZZAMAN'S CASE The tribunal had fixed yesterday as the last chance for recording the testimony of the fifth and last defence witness in the case as the defence had failed to produce the witness on Monday and Wednesday. On Monday, neither the witness nor any senior defence counsels appeared before the court citing \"unavoidable situation\". The main opposition BNP-led 18-party combine enforced hartal that day. On Wednesday, the defence sought an adjournment saying their witness could not come from Sherpur due to the two-day hartal enforced on Monday and Tuesday. Kamaruzzaman's counsel Ehsan A Siddiq yesterday told the tribunal that their witness could not appear due to health condition and prayed for an adjournment. The tribunal fixed Sunday for hearing the closing arguments from the prosecution and said it would allow defence testimony if the defence could produce their witness that day. On June 4, 2012, the tribunal indicted the Jamaat assistant secretary general on seven charges which include murder and torture of unarmed civilians during the Liberation War in 1971. As many as 18 prosecution witnesses including the investigation officer of the case gave their testimony against the Jamaat leader, while four defence witnesses have testified in the case. CONTEMPT RULE AGAINST JAMAAT LEADERS Yesterday's proceeding started at 10:42am and Tajul Islam, on behalf of Jamaat leader Selim Uddin, submitted written explanation in connection with a contempt of court rule. On February 7, the tribunal asked three Jamaat leaders including Selim Uddin to explain as to why contempt of court proceedings should not be initiated against them for making “provocative and derogatory remarks” about the tribunal. Two other leaders are Jamaat acting secretary general Rafiqul Islam Khan and central executive council member Hamidur Rahman Azad. The tribunal issued the notice on the basis of reports published in The Daily Star and Bangla daily Prothom Alo on February 5 on a Jamaat rally held in the capital the previous day. The Prothom Alo quoted Selim Uddin as saying: \"There is no scope for the controversial tribunal to deliver any verdict if the country is to be saved from a civil war.\" Azad was quoted as saying at the same programme, \"This tribunal cannot exist anymore.\" The Daily Star in a report headlined \"Jamaat warns of civil war\" quoted Rafiqul Islam as saying, \"Don't push the country into a civil war by delivering one-sided verdicts against our leaders. If anything happens to Quader Mollah, every house will be on fire.\" On March 6, the tribunal ordered the police to arrest the three Jamaat leaders and produce them before the court for “deliberately avoiding” appearance before the tribunal. The trio missed their day in court four times. Following the warrant, law enforcers arrested Selim Uddin on March 8 and produced him before the tribunal on March 10. On that day, the tribunal asked him to give explanation yesterday. The tribunal, however, granted bail and exempted him from personal appearance. Selim was kept detained in other criminal cases. After Tajul Islam submitted Selim's explanation, the tribunal fixed April 10 for further order in this regard and asked the police to give an execution report on the arrest warrant within the date. PETITION FOR TWO JAMAAT LEADERS REJECTED Meanwhile, the tribunal rejected a petition filed by Tajul Islam on behalf of the two other Jamaat leaders for modifying the February 7 order so that they could be exempted from personal appearance before the court. Submitting the petition, Tajul said Jamaat leaders Rafiqul Islam Khan and Hamidur Rahman Azad wanted to appear before the court but could not for \"unusual circumstances\" and sought their exemption from personal appearance. The tribunal said it was not possible as three lawyers of the Jamaat leaders had withdrawn their power of attorney and the tribunal had already issued arrest warrant against them for“violating “its order. \"Besides, how could you file power of attorney [vocalatnama] for fugitives?\" the tribunal questioned Tajul. Tajul said the tribunal could consider his prayer as it was a matter of contempt of court rule. \"We consider the matter [of filing power of attorney for fugitives] leniently and that's why we are not sending you to Bar Council,\" the tribunal said and rejected the petition. Bangladesh Bar Council is licensing authority to lawyers of the country for practising law. The tribunal closed its day's proceeding at 10:55am. Meanwhile, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 yesterday rejected war crimes accused Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's petition to join parliament session as the concerned act does not allow the tribunal to do so. SQ Chowdhury filed a petition saying according to a section of East Pakistan Assembly Members' Privileges Act, 1965, he was entitled to join parliament session. The tribunal yesterday also disposed of SQ Chowdhury's another petition. SQ Chowhdury in his petition prayed to the tribunal to ask the authorities of Kashimpur Jail-1 to investigate how and by whom his conversation of December 16, 2012 was uploaded in YouTube. He also prayed to the Tribunal-1 to take step as the jail authorities did not let him take legal action for defamation. The tribunal said the matter was not related to the case and was rather an internal matter of the jail authorities. Justice ATM Fazle Kabir, chairman of Tribunal-1, however directed the jail authorities to take step so that SQ Chowdhury could sign on power of attorney for filing a defamation suit. The tribunal yesterday also rejected bail prayer in two cases against war crimes convict Delawar Hossain Sayedee as the case documents were never submitted by the prosecution to the tribunal. Defence counsel Mizanul Islam said two cases filed with Pirojpur Sadar Police Station and Zianagar Police Station were transferred to the Investigation Agency of the International Crimes Tribunal. The cases are still under investigation. Yesterday was fixed for hearing the closing argument of the defence in the war crimes case against former Jamaat ameer Ghulam Azam at the Tribunal-1. But, following the declaration of a public holiday to mourn the death of president Zillur Rahman, the tribunal adjourned proceeding at about 11:30am.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/kamaruzzamans-trial-at-final-stage", "date": "2013-03-22T00:00:38+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1194},

As a result, role of those who have had their lives dedicated for the cause of their fellow beings goes unsung, unheard. The Dainik Janakantha has certainly made a difference. The Bengali daily has effectively shown that recognition of contribution in the socio-cultural arena is an integral part of journalistic consciousness. The Janakantha Gunijan Sammanana (Honour for Men of Accomplishment) and Pratibha Sammanana (Honour for Men of Merit) are indeed a praiseworthy initiative, and we extend our hearty congratulations to the minds behind the move.

{"title": "Tanguar battle won", "body": "The government has finally decided to declare the Tanguar Haor, the 9725 hectare fresh water lake in Tahirpur, Sunamganj as a Ramsar site to protect the wetland's rich bio-diversity. Necessary orders to declare it as a Ramsar site has already been signed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday, officials said yesterday. Earlier last year, the wetland was declared as an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) by the ministry of forests and environment in the backdrop of demands from the environmentalists. They had been pressing for saving the lake and its diverse eco-system that supports migratory birds like the rarest Tibetan Black Net Stork, whose existence had become threatened following leasing of the wetland for commercial exploitation by the Land Ministry in October last year. The Land Ministry overrode a Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) declaration in April, proclaiming it as an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA). As the MOEF fought against attempts at leasing the haor, which yields an estimated Tk.10 crore in revenues from commercial exploitation of fish and other resources for sometime last year, declaring it as an ECA, forbidding commercial exploitation of its natural resources without any management plan. It wanted to implement the plan with community participation in line with a recommendation by a panel of experts, headed by Wim Giesen from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). But Ministry of Land claimed it to be their property and leased it out following manipulations by influential ones only for Tk 46 lakhs. While the two ministries fought over the issues, the file regarding declaration of it as a Ramsar site became 'missing' at the Prime Minister's office! However, it was retrieved later on and finally signed by the PM. Officials said that the lease would run out sometime in April. The declaration of it as a Ransar site would prohibit further leasing, they added. Home to many rare species, including the Pallas's fishing Eagle, a globally endangered bird, 17 critically endangered fish out of 140 species, the 9725 hectare wetland supports the last surviving swamp forest in the country --- consisting of Hijal, Karach, Gunji kata and Chhongrass or reeds. It sustains a wide variety of fish and aquatic life, including many exotic species and waterfowls, seasonally harbouring at least 60,000 of them besides the resident birds. A large flock of waterfowls visit the wetland every year. Last year a Blacknet Stork, fishermen farming the wetland wounded a very rare specie. A few hundred Blacknet's survive in Tibet only. The migratory birds from the Himalayas use Bangladesh as a 'transit point during their journey to and from the mountains. Following mounting concern on indiscriminate fishing and hunting, the government decided to include the Haor to the list of the ECAs for a better wetland management policy, terminating a fisheries lease last December. Already the National Conservation Strategy (NCS) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) has recommended that the haor be declared a Ramsar site on the basis of a declaration adopted at Ramsar, Iran. Bangladesh is a signatory to the declaration for preserving the world's wet lands, letting the nature survive in pristine condition under proper management. The NCS recommendations follow a detailed study by six experts including a wetland conservation specialist from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Wim Giesen. The others from Bangladesh were SMA Rashid, AKM Nuruzzaman Khan, Anisuzzaman Khan, Syed Shafique Ahmed and Abu Naser Khan studied the lake's management, fishery, birds, socio-economic and land tenure aspects. The report identified the main issues of the Tanguar Haor-- the decline of fisheries production due to over-fishing, depletion of natural resources like reed lands and swamp forest, which threatened the birds like Pallas's eagle, decline in the number of migratory birds and against such backdrop, a growing threat of conflict between the local community and the leaseholder of fisheries over the question of resources. The study, prepared with the help of the satellite imageries drew a sustainable management plan for the haor ecosystem and natural resources. Considering the close relation between an estimated 25,000 people living around 46 villages, they suggested an integrated conservation and management plan, involving the community without leasing the lake to individuals/groups who hired seasonal labour from outside-- as had been the practice so long. Anisuzzaman Khan, one of the experts from the IUCN, said that the lake is the only wetland in Bangladesh which is unique because of its bio-diversity and fits in the criteria set for declaring it as a Ramsar site like the 'transit' camp for migratory birds. He said its resources could be used on a sustainable basis with community participation. According to a gazette notification by the MOEF on April 1999, three haors have been declared as ECA. Besides the Tangaur Haor, others are the Hakaluki Haor in Maulvibazar and Sylhet and Marjat Haor in Kaliganj, Jhenaidah. It prohibits destruction or felling of natural forest and trees, hunting and killing of wildlife, trapping and collection of shells, coral, turtle and other wildlife, all activities that destroys the habitat of wildlife and plants, activities that may alter or change the natural quality of the land and water, setting up of industries or organisations that may pollute the soil, water, air and sound or any act that may harm the fish and other aquatic life, water and the air.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/tanguar-battle-won", "date": "2000-01-14T00:00:10+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 888},

Had he persevered in his desk job, he could have returned to England with enough savings for a comfortable if also anonymous life. He would possibly have lived longer, would not have died by his own hand and buried almost clandestinely under a church. On the other hand his descendants would not have been peers and he would not have become even a footnote person of history let alone one of the creators of a mighty empire. A difficult question therefore. Not too many swashbuckling films seem to be made these days. The heroes of adventure films are more of the Rambo variety than like Robin Hood of old; they fire automatic weapons rather than wield the sword. Swashbuckling films depicted a romanticized and escapist version of the feudal age in the West. Heroes were handsome, men of honour and exceptionally skilled at swordplay. Errol Flynn was perhaps as handsome, debonair and popular as any actor who ever \"buckled a swash.\" His Robin Hood made in the 1930s does not seem dated when seen even today. Duels were part of a code of honour. If someone's honour was impugned, he could challenge the offender to a duel. The choice of weapons -- usually pistols or swords -- was the prerogative of the person challenged. Honour was vindicated after first blood was drawn or even if pistols were simply fired into space. The process, of course, was not always simple or innocuous. One of the most gifted personalities of the early days of the American revolution was Alexander Hamilton. He was one of the authors of the Federalist Papers, the first Secretary of the Treasury and also close to George Washington. But for the fact that he lost his life in a senseless duel, it is conceivable that he might even have made it to the Presidency. The person who shot him dead, after Hamilton had fired his shot in the air, was also a political figure, whose name today is synonymous with unbridled ambition. The greatest of US Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, was an auto-didact with a singular feel for language. He wrote and delivered two or three of the most uplifting, edifying and enduring of speeches in the English language. He was very much a man of the \"pen\" and not the \"sword.\" And yet in his youth, he once came close to fighting a duel to the death. In 1842, using his formidable writing skills, Lincoln lampooned a somewhat vain politician by the name of James Shields in a letter to a newspaper. The town of Springfield, where the paper was published, was immensely amused, but a thoroughly incensed Shields was not. He demanded satisfaction and challenged Lincoln to a duel. A reluctant Lincoln chose the cavalry broad sword as weapon and even took lessons from a West Point graduate. On the scheduled day the duellists met and were prepared to fight to the death when better sense prevailed; their seconds intervened -- something no doubt consistent with the somewhat quaint code of honour -- to stop the duel. Lincoln reportedly never ridiculed anyone and almost \"never criticized anybody\" from that time. Robert Lord Clive of Plassey is believed to have fought a duel in India.Like Lincoln, he was largely self-taught and tended to melancholy at times. An eminent educationist of Bangladesh, whom I shall call Professor X, once recounted to me an anecdote which is expressive of how people of this region tend to regard Clive. Professor X had gone to London for the first time for higher studies and happened upon a statue of Clive at or near Whitehall. The statue was impressive, with Clive in a lordly and supercilious pose. Professor X, a man of puckish humour and an immense sense of humanity, looked round to assure himself that no one was paying attention and then planted a firm kick at the bottom of the statue before moving serenely on! Clive was one of those who gave up the pen for the sword. He had gone to India for the first time at the impressionable age of 18 as a clerk in the employ of the English East India Company. His exploits in the struggle with the French for supremacy in India is well-known. With a small fortune he left India for England in 1753 only to return soon with enhanced authority and status. After Plassey -- more a cannonade than a battle -- his fame and future were assured. He went on to lay the foundations of British rule in the sub-continent. While consolidating English authority he did not exactly ignore his own interests. By the time his second governorship ended and he left permanently for England, he had amassed a fortune estimated to be in the neighbourhood of a quarter of a million Pounds and also acquired a jagir worth Pounds 30,000 annually. In between his tours of duty he had been given an Irish barony and a knighthood. On his final return home he acquired a pocket borough in Shrewsbury from where he was elected to Parliament. His ambitions for a career in politics in England foundered amidst allegations of corruption. He faced a Parliamentary Inquiry with characteristic verve and panache. At one point he exclaimed \"By God, Mr Chairman, at this moment, I stand astonished at my own moderation!\" Parliament did not quite absolve him of all wrong-doing but conceded that he did \"render great and meritorious services to his country.\" William Pitt described him as a \"heaven born general.\" Historians of the sub-continent have been remarkably generous in assessing the man. Some scholars are of the view that he was distinguished in war and peace, that he occupied a prominent place in the galaxy of British generals and administrators who carved out a mighty empire, that he possessed tact, patience, industry and foresight, had a steady and clear grasp of the ends, and combined high idealism with sound common sense. By the age of 49, Clive was dead,by his own hand. Afflicted by a painful disease contracted in India, he relied increasingly on opium for relief. Wearied by attacks of his own countrymen for his venality and duplicity and plagued by ill-health, he slit his throat in London, away from Shrewsbury, using perhaps a cut-throat razor so common in those times. On one of my early visits to the UK, a friend took me to Highgate to see Marx's tomb. It occurred to me then that it should be of interest also to see where Clive was buried; out of a sense of history more than anything else. Curiously enough, apart from the statue at Whitehall, it was not very easy to find out too much about the founder of the British Empire in India. Neither Burke's nor Debrett's, both standard volumes of reference on the peerage, made mention of any Baron of Plassey, as I would have expected Clive's descendants to be known. Neither did Dod's annual publication that listed all parliamentarians. It was Nirad C. Chaudhuri, who wrote a book on Clive, that updated me about him.His barony had been elevated to an earldom and his descendent was now known as the Earl of Powis. Clive himself was buried in the church at Shrewsbury. In the company of a few friends I did go to Shrewsbury. A friendly curate at the church greeted us with the words \"You must be from the sub-continent, only people from there still have an interest in Clive.\" A lady living nearby joined us.She was none too complimentary about Clive. Clive she said was believed to be the wealthiest man in England when he returned from India. His Spartan offices in Shrewsbury was still maintained as a museum of sorts, which not too many people visited however. The curate could not show us the tomb, as Clive was buried not in the cemetery near the church but under the church. He explained why. As a suicide, Clive could not be buried in consecrated grounds but he was also Shrewsbury's most distinguished son. The church authorities found an ingenious solution. Officially they had no intimation about the suicide. So affecting ignorance of that inconvenient fact they agreed on burial on church grounds. However to guard against any desecration by those who were only too aware of the facts they took the precaution to bury him beneath the church rather than in the cemetery. There was apparently some problem of access to the location of the tomb under the church and as such we could not see it. If Clive's many talents included the gift of prophecy, would he still have opted for the sword rather than the pen? Had he persevered in his desk job, he could have returned to England with enough savings for a comfortable if also anonymous life. He would possibly have lived longer, would not have died by his own hand and buried almost clandestinely under a church. On the other hand his descendants would not have been peers and he would not have become even a footnote person of history let alone one of the creators of a mighty empire. A difficult question therefore. Clive lived at a time when adventurers abounded and flourished, people who trusted in their stars and laughed in the face of death and at superior numbers. None will know what thoughts went through his tormented mind -- and tormented he must have been to do what he did -- as he opened his cut-throat razor for the last time, not for a shave but for a grisly and unspeakable purpose. If the lives and deeds of Clive and Lincoln and the way they are remembered today, are a pointer or afford any insights, there is much truth in the old adage that \"the pen is mightier than the sword.\" Whether at the end of the day Clive himself believed this or not will have to remain unanswered.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-pen-is-mightier-than-the-sword", "date": "2003-01-04T00:00:36+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1673},

In a statement issued on Saturday, CAF said it had fined the Nigerian Football Association (NFA) \"an amount of 2000 dollars for the unruly crowd behaviour after the Super Eagles' match against Congo Brazzaville\" here on Friday. \"CAF issues a strict warning to the public not to repeat such kind of behaviour. In the contrary, the matches concerning Nigeria will be played behind closed doors,\" the statement said. Nigerian fans threw bottles onto the pitch and besieged their star-studded team's dressing room after the tournament favourites, who had won their opener against Tunisia 4-2, drew 0-0 with minnows Congo on Friday afternoon. The team were locked inside the changing-room for their own safety. Police had to use teargas to disperse the mob who laid siege to the dressing room where the players had taken refuge. Police dispersed the irate local fans with tear gas after they smashed the window of the team bus. The fans had hurled plastic bottles onto the pitch towards the end of the match. Meanwhile, the Nigerian squad have hit back urging the supporters to be \"more civilised\". \"You don't win all matches, our fans should understand that and be more cultured and civilised in how they react to our performance,\" team coach Jo Bonfrere said on Saturday. \"We didn't go out there for a 0-0 draw. We always want to win for our country...our fans. That we drew shouldn't make the fans be unruly,\" said Tijjani Babangida, a second-half substitute in Friday's match. Team captain Sunday Oliseh said: \"I'm disappointed with the attitude of the fans. Why jeer us when we did not lose?\" Soccer is treated with almost religious devotion by many of the West African country's 108 million people.

The watchdog said it had identified at least 119 places across Syria where at least 156 cluster bombs have been used in the past six months, including two attacks in the last two weeks that killed 11 civilians and injured 27 others. \"The initial toll is only the beginning because cluster munitions often leave unexploded bomblets that kill and maim long afterward,\" Goose added.

{"title": "Drugs and Dues", "body": "The news about Sir Salimullah Medical College & Mitford Hospital running without any essential drugs, including life-saving ones, for the last two months once again reveals the disheartening status of the country's health- and medi-care services system. Lack of supply of about two hundred such medicines for more than eight weeks sends dreary signals to patients who depend on this hospital located in the old part of Dhaka city. And that patients undergoing surgery are left on their own to buy drugs which are vital from stores outside the hospital premises is another dreadful worry. This proves inefficiency of the medical administration in the country. The absence of essential drugs reportedly originates from financial mismanagement of the hospital authority, the health directorate of the government and Essential Drug Company Limited (EDCL), the firm that provides pharmaceutical products to the government-run hospitals. On the one hand, EDCL has held up their supply to Mitford Hospital which owed quite a large amount of money to the former; and on the other, cash sanctioned for this hospital by the financial wing of the health directorate is not sufficient to resume this supply immediately. The apparent lack of co-ordination and financing among these authorities are affecting the patients. This asymmetrical anomaly must not be allowed to continue. The health directorate should evaluate whether there is a need to raise budget allocations for the hospitals, the hospital concerned should be more cautious about handling drugs so that these don't find way illegally into the stores outside the hospital, and EDCL is expected to be more flexible about supplying medicine so that no patient aches in absence of a 'pathedrine'.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/drugs-and-dues", "date": "1999-01-02T00:00:11+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 274},

And our reports have matched the facts that they had gathered.\" Citing the growing dangers of terrorism as the main obstacle to Tripura's development, Sarkar said he had also asked the Central Government to take certain preventive measures. \"But they have not done so,\" he said. \"I had asked for fencing off the entire 156 kilometres that separate Tripura from Bangladesh.

The propaganda apparently influenced Washington to impose immigration restrictions on Bangladeshis, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson said. Khaleda also brushed aside Awami League President Sheikh Hasina's claim that the four-party alliance government was to blame for the US decision. \"My government is not responsible at all. It was she and her party who had influenced the decision with anti-Bangladesh statements at home and abroad.\" She said the party portrayed Bangladesh as a communal state when in power to then US President Bill Clinton during his visit in March 2000. The party's propaganda had influenced Clinton's decision to cancel all scheduled programmes including a visit to the Savar National Mausoleum, Khaleda said. The US president spent the whole day in hotel, only attending a Bangabhaban programme, she added. Without naming the AL chief and senior Indian ministers, Khaleda said, \"They used similar words in their statements against Bangladesh. They said the same things at the same time.\" \"It is unfortunate that senior leaders of that country made such false and imaginary allegations against Bangladesh. This is nothing but a deep-rooted conspiracy against Bangladesh.\" The party's campaign and the subsequent US restrictions has thrown hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi students and workers overseas into uncertainty and panic, the prime minister told the Sramik Dal leaders and activists. \"Can the leader be called patriotic? They (AL) have put our independence, sovereignty and economy in jeopardy and are still trying to isolate the country from the world only to avenge their defeat in the elections.\" However, she said, such campaigns would not be successful, as Bangladesh \"has a reputation of being a moderate and democratic country in the world\". Khaleda said she firmly believed that the US \"knows Bangladesh as a moderate country\" and would drop the country from its terror-risk list and withdraw the immigration restrictions. Turning to the industrial sector, the prime minister said her government would close down all losing concerns and set up new ones to create employment for the laid-off workers.

{"title": "Kallis, Cullinan shine", "body": "CAPE TOWN, Jan 4: Daryll Cullinan made a fighting century to keep South Africa on top on the third day of the fourth Test against England on Tuesday, despite a fiery performance by England fast bowler Chris Silverwood, reports AFP. Cullinan, whose 10th test century equalled the South African record held by opener Gary Kirsten, made 120 in a South African total of 421, a first innings lead of 163. Left-arm spinner Paul Adams bowled the only over England had to face before the close in their second innings and conceded a four to Mark Butcher, reducing the deficit to 159. Silverwood, 25, was England's hero, taking a career-best five for 91 in his fourth Test match. The Yorkshireman, who joined the tour as a replacement following an injury to Dean Headley, showed immense spirit as he kept charging in and bowling at high pace, despite stifling 34 degree heat. England seemed likely to have an uphill battle on a good batting pitch when South Africa resumed at 200 for one but they struck blows at crucial times as South Africa lost six further wickets for the addition of 107 runs. England skipper Nasser Hussain handled his bowlers skilfully, using them in short bursts to combat the heat. Cullinan kept his composure, however, and found a solid partner in wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, who made 36 in an eighth wicket stand of 90 in 126 minutes, which ensured South Africa would have a substantial lead. Cullinan batted for 351 minutes, faced 255 balls and hit ten fours and a six. Kirsten's run of form ended, however, when he was out to the first ball he faced Tuesday, edging Silverwood to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart without adding to his overnight 80, ending a second wicket stand of 158 with Jacques Kallis. Kallis, who also started the day on 80, went to his sixth Test century before being caught at first slip by Mike Atherton off Darren Gough for 105 in the first over with the second new ball. South African captain Hansie Cronje continued a run of poor form when he was caught by Michael Vaughan at gully off Caddick for nought. Selection convenor Rushdi Magiet said, however, he would assure Cronje that the selectors had full confidence in the man they have appointed until the end of the season. Recalled Jonty Rhodes was caught by Chris Adams at second slip off Silverwood for 16 and Lance Klusener was bowled by Gough for three, trying to force a straight ball to the offside. Shaun Pollock was also caught by Adams at second slip off Caddick for four before Boucher helped Cullinan extend South Africa's lead. England were without allrounder Andrew Flintoff, who suffered a fractured bone in his left foot while bowling Monday. It was announced Tuesday that Flintoff had been ruled out of the rest of the tour. It was also announced that six England players who are flying out to join the team for a triangular limited overs series after the Test series would arrive five days earlier than originally planned. The players, Mark Alleyne, Mark Ealham, Ashley Giles, Graeme Hick, Nick Knight and Vikram Solanki, will join the team on Friday and will be available for a three-day match against a South African invitation team starting Sunday, England's last first class match before the fifth and final Test starting at Centurion on January 14.

{"title": "Double-decker vs. articulated buses", "body": "An interesting and thought-provoking article on double-decker buses was published in the pages of an English financial daily on 18th April. It deserves serious consideration and financial evaluation by BRTC authorities. The proposed interesting idea of having only all standing room passenger facilities on some buses running on the busy routes particularly during office time deserves a trial by BRTC. This facility can ease the peak hour rush to some extent and can be cost effective fuel wise. BRTC should carry out a realistic cost benefit analysis between normal and all-standing bus services. I firmly believe that the standing service buses will be viable even if passenger fares are reduced by 25 percent! Further, it will be interesting to compare the operating costs between normal sitting service double-decker buses and the articulated long buses introduced recently by BRTC. A total cost benefit analysis definitely has been done by BRTC, before going for the articulated buses from India. It will be appreciated if the dailies can look into it, and publish it for public interest, as no other considerations should come in analysis of this important cost-benefit projection on operating the two types of buses!", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/double-decker-vs-articulated-buses", "date": "2013-03-27T00:00:41+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 194},

{"title": "Army can’t be silent observer: Khaleda", "body": "BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia addresses a rally at Matidali in Bogra on Sunday. Photo: Banglar Chokh Opposition leader Khaleda Zia said on Sunday that the army cannot play “a silent spectator” if peace remains absent in the country. Thanking the army personnel for not opening fire on people in Bogra “like what police did” on March 3, she expressed hope that Bangladesh Army would “play its due role in proper time” to maintain peace in the country. Khaleda was referring to deaths of nine people when Jamaat-Shibir men tricked locals with so-called sighting of Delawar Hossain Sayedee in the moon and clashed with law enforcers, attacked police stations, vandalised and torched different offices in the northern district. “The army is the part of Bangladesh and, therefore, has responsibilities towards the country. The army men cannot watch like silent spectators when people are being killed,” she said while addressing a wayside rally at Matidali intersection in Bogra Sadar Upazila. “The army will play its due role in proper time.” Addressing the first rally on her way to Joypurhat, the BNP chairperson also said army personnel go abroad for maintaining peace. But if there is no peace in their own country, foreigners would then say that the army is only capable of maintaining peace in other countries. “So, I ask all quarters to think about it.” Terming the Awami League-led government as “most autocratic, blood thirsty, killer and the most corrupt”, she threatened of crippling the whole country to force it to step down. The BNP would announce fresh agitation programmes on Monday to make its one-point topple government movement a success. The programmes will start from March 26, she added. Alleging that people of no community or religion are now safe as long as Awami League remains in power, Khaleda said: “The government is carrying out genocide one after another.” She urged people to wage resistance against what she termed government-sponsored killing and repression on the citizens of the country. Weapons, bullets, bombs will be of no use when people wage united movement, she warned the government. Asking people to join the movement “to save your sons, daughters and husbands”, the opposition leader threatened, “If necessary, we will paralyse the whole country.” The opposition led by the BNP would not act passive now, she said. “We will no longer shed tears from now. We will wage resistance and Bogra will be the door of the movement,” she told a cheering crowd of Bogra, a stronghold of the party. Khaleda also called upon people of all professions, including civil administration and police members, to engage themselves with the mass people. The opposition leader offered condolences and distributed cash among the families of seven victims who were shot dead on March 3 in Matidali. In Joypurhat, Khaleda said the government had stopped bus and launches during the opposition's ‘Dhaka Cholo’ programme. If necessary, come to Dhaka for one more time and return to homes after ousting the government from power, she made the call while addressing a mourning rally at Salaipur High School ground in Panchbibi upazila of Joypurhat in the afternoon. Joypurhat district unit of BNP organised the rally in memory of the death of four people during the recent violence across the country. The opposition leader said the prime minister must be accountable for all killings after coming to power. \"Wherever you go, you will have to face trial,\" she warned the prime minister. BNP leaders including Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Selima Rahman, Sadeque Hossain Khoka and Mirza Abbas accompanied her in the visit. On a two-day visit to Bogra and Joypurhat, the BNP chief reached Bogra Saturday night and spent the night at the local circuit house. They headed back for Bogra later and visit a Hindu temple in Gabtoli upazila that came under attack by religious bigots recently. Later, Khaleda addressed a rally at Aria Bazar School premises in Shahjahanpur upazila around 8:00pm. She demanded deployment of army to maintain law and order during the next parliamentary elections. The government should bring changes in the Representation of the People Order (RPO) in this regard, she said. \"Without the deployment of the army the next general polls won't be free and fair,\" Khaleda said at the rally in the evening. After the rally, she started for Dhaka around 9:00pm.

{"title": "Forced labor and Syedpur Airport construction", "body": "Syedpur Airport and runway constructed by Bengalis who were forced to provide labor in 1971. Photo: Lt. Col. (Retd.) Quazi Sajjad Ali Zahir, Bir Protik Forced labor is any compulsory labor service particularly those demanded by a dominant military force on prisoners of war, detainees or conquered civilian population. In 1971, after Pakistan Army moved in force in Syedpur and surrounding villages, they were given reception and congratulated by the non-Bengali population for capturing Syedpur and for conducting massacre on Bengali population. Pakistan Army and their collaborators who were mainly non-Bengalis in Syedpur used fear and threat on the Bengali population. The Bengalis were interned in the town area of Syedpur. Pakistan Army undertook a project in Syedpur in which they planned to use the Bengali population of Syedpur town and nearby villages as forced laborers. They planned to construct a large airport in Syedpur. There was an existing airport in Lalmonirhat and another abandoned airport in Thakurgaon. They considered Syedpur to be a safe place to construct an airport as the non Bengali population of Syedpur was totally in their support. They planned to construct a large runway so that large air crafts with troops and arms could land in Syedpur for supporting the operations of Pakistan Army in north Bangladesh. Their decision was also influenced by the fact that the ferry route across Jamuna River was insecure as Mukti Bahini guerillas were frequently conducting operations and causing casualties in the river. 23 Infantry Brigade of Pakistan Army was given responsibility to construct the airport. Army decided to construct the airport by using Bengalis as forced laborers. They brought about three thousand people from Syedpur town, Hazarihat, Motlabari, Kamarpur, Laxmanpur, Kashirampur, Shonara and other places of North Bengal. They examined the three thousand persons and out of them selected eight hundred younger and stronger people and interned them by force into three educational institutions namely Syedpur High School, Syedpur Darul Wulum Madrassa and Syedpur Technical School. The detainees were threatened that they would have to work in the Syedpur airport and anyone who tried to escape would face death. Every morning at 8 o'clock about 35-40 trucks used to line up in front of the three concentration camps. The trucks were of military and civilian models. With every truck they used armed soldiers and non-Bengalis to guard the laborers. The detainees used to be ordered to mount the trucks. If anyone delayed in mounting the truck, they used to be kicked and whipped. This was a common scenario every morning. The trucks used to drive the people to the airport area. After disembarking, the detainees had to dig the earth, break the stones, carry the earth and the stones and construct the airport runway. Through out the day they had to work in extreme heat. In return at mid-day they used to be given a hard bread and water. The bread was so hard that it could not be chewed. The detainees used to dip the bread in water and eat it. Under such brutal condition many detainees used to fall sick or even faint. If anyone fell down, he used to be beaten by whips mainly carried by the non-Bengalis. The non-Bengalis used to discuss and point at the sick workers and say that it was no point keeping them there and their name was to be put in the Kharcha Khata (Note book of expandable) indicating that they would be killed. Many of the sick were carried away and they never returned. If any detainees argued or tried to run away he used to be carried by truck to Syedpur cantonment never to return. Out of fear the people kept working inspite of their sickness and tiredness. Escaping from the airport site or from the living quarter was impossible as both the places were guarded by soldiers with weapons. Among the non-Bengalis who tortured the interns' maximum were Jahan, Ejahar, Matin, Hashmi, Qaiyum, Sultan Khan, Mojahar, Ismail, Mohiuddin, Kalua Dhopi, Swampad, etc. Some of the detainees who survived later are Moinul, Enamul, Mahbub, Shahidul, Ziaul Huq, Wadud, Kashem Ali Mollick, Kasoruddin, Abdus Sattar, Abdur Rashid, Mizanul Huq, etc. Pakistani officers who were in charge of the airport project were Major Javed, Captain Gul, Subeder Fateh Khan. Capt. Gul used to be seen with a revolver in his hand threatening to kill the detainees. Subder Fateh Khan used to beat the detainees with whip even if they fell sick or became unconscious. Some of the detainees who were killed in the airport area were Mansur Ali, Gomiruddin, Abdul Gafur, Abdus Samad, Sultan, Kalam, Hishabuddin, Rafiqullah, Bechu Miah, Abdul Motaleb, Rajob Ali, Afzal, Hatem Ali, Shahadat Hossain, Mofiz Uddin, Abdul Kalam, Jamir Uddin.. Rest of the names could not be obtained. It is known from local people that out of eight hundred detainees about 350 died while working in the airport. The work in Syedpur airport started in June, 1971 and continued till November, 1971. The runway was completed. After November, 1971, when the possibility of a major war was predicted by Pakistan Army, they stopped further work in the airport area. Pakistan Army named the airport “Zum Zum” after the name of the Holy water from the Holy well of Mekkah. But it is unfortunate to remember that so many innocent people in this airport had died begging for water. On 16 December, 1971, Pakistan Army surrendered to the joint forces of Indian Army and Mukti Bahini and the place of surrender was decided to be the Syedpur airport. 23 Brigade Commander Brigadier Iqbal Shafi and his officers and men stood in line in the runway preparing to surrender. Pakistan Army's 25 Punjab, 48 Punjab, 8 Punjab, 26 Frontier Force regiments and 83 Mujahid battalion were all lined up. Among them the 26 Frontier Force Regiment who was involved in supervision of forced labor in the same airport. The 26 Frontier Force Commanding Officer Lt. Col. Hakeem Arshad Qureshi in his book “The 1971 Indo-Pak War: A Soldier's Narrative” writes that they had to surrender in the airport which they (soldiers of 26 Frontier Force Regiment) built on self help basis. This was a statement far from truth. The airport was never built by 26 Frontier Force Regiment soldiers. 26 Frontier Force Regiment was mainly deployed in full strength in Dinajpur area during 1971. It was the interned Bengalis who constructed the airport as forced laborers. When the time for surrender came, Lt. Col. Hakeem Arshad Qureshi shouted 'Zamin Fung' (ground arms) and the surrender was complete. The officers and men of Pakistan Army collectively performed the shameful act in the airport where they had killed so many. They did not lay down their lives but only their arms in the line of duty. Hardly anyone of new generation of Bangladesh knows as to how Syedpur airport was constructed.

{"title": "BNP faces derision and rejection from AL, Left", "body": "The BNP-led opposition unity on a four-point charter of demands and threats of a street agitation to oust the Awami League government have met with derision from the ruling party and condemnation from the Left. The ruling party calls the unity \"fragile\", terming it a coalition between BNP and \"autocratic and fundamentalist\" parties. Government leaders find no substance in the opposition demands either. Besides, the Left parties are also critical of the opposition coalition calling it \"a rightist and reactionary polarisation\". These parties also view it as a \"virtual alliance of power-hunters.\" The opposition unity suffered a setback on the very day it virtually began its journey as one of the partners -- Islami Oikya Jote - found itself divided on the issue. Furthermore, one of the opposition demands has also raised legal questions -using ID cards for voters in the forthcoming mayoral and municipal elections. Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena, in an interview with The Daily Star Wednesday night, said there was no law making ID cards mandatory for local polls. The CEC also called this demand \"unrealistic\" and \"impractical\", adding the voters' card project would not be complete before the local elections. In the backdrop of the new polarisation, the AL presidium is due to meet on January 12 to take stock of the latest situation. Nevertheless, the opposition parties are optimistic about their unity because, as one top BNP leader puts it, the people are very much with them. The BNP plans to expand the coalition by bringing the Left parties into the fold, but the JP is opposed to the idea, according to sources in the two parties. A top AL leader, Suranjit Sengupta, says three of the opposition demands are matters to be taken care of by the Election Commission while he finds no basis for the fourth -- the alleged repression on the opposition activists. On rest of the fourth demand -- release of all political detainees and withdrawal of \"false\" cases against the opposition leaders and workers, he said, ''It's purely a matter of the judiciary. Any government intervention is undesirable.\" Sengupta also describes the BNP-JP unity as \"a natural alliance of the parties overthrown by the people\". On Jamaat-e-Islami, another partner, he says \"the anti-Liberation party\" has been allied with the BNP for long. BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan suggests a solution to the voters' ID card issue on a priority basis. \"The EC can distribute such cards among the voters of four metropolitan cities and then to the municipal areas. But we want it mandatory for all local government polls.\" Asked to justify their demand for CEC's exit, Bhuiyan claims the major political parties have lost confidence in him. \"He must go for the sake of fair polls.\" About political cases, the BNP leader keeps blaming the government for not \"honouring\" its earlier agreements on the matter. \"The number of arrested opposition workers now stands around 1500. We want their release immediately.\" BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed looks at the demand for voters' ID cards as a political issue, not a legal one. \"We want it in 30 days, that's all. I'm not going to reply to what the CEC said. \"What did the EC do in the past two-and-half-years? Did they lay eggs? What else did the EC do except holding some by-polls over the time?\" Insisted, on the CEC's point, Moudud says, \"We want the government to amend the law. It can be done in two minutes by promulgating an Ordinance. That ID card is not mandatory to use in the local government polls is a lame excuse by the CEC. It's not a matter of amending law but the government's intention.\" \"As per law, every voter must have an ID card. But do they all have the cards? No matter if they use it in the local polls or general elections. The EC has failed to issue such cards to all voters in the last two-and-half-years. Why did they do? There's a political motive behind non-issuance of the cards.\" JP presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed warns the government must step down if it fails to meet the opposition demands within the stipulated time of 30 days. The deadline expires February 5. Zafar thinks it is not impossible for the government to withdraw \"false\" cases against the opposition leaders and workers if it is sincere about resolving the crisis. Meanwhile, leaders of different Left parties talked to the BSS yesterday on the BNP-JP-Jamaat-IOJ coalition and their demands. Mozaffar Hossain of NAP termed the opposition alliance \"a rightist and reactionary polarisation\" and suggested the \"people should take care of these forces\". Workers Party general secretary Rashed Khan Menon said, \"This coalition will expedite the legitimisation of the razakars and the autocrats.\" JSD leader Hasanul Haq Inu commented the opposition unity would trigger \"a new wave of politics of killings and conspiracy\". On CEC's resignation, he said the change would not ensure free polls. \"The election must be freed from black money and muscle power.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bnp-faces-derision-and-rejection-from-al-left", "date": "1999-01-08T00:00:02+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 837},
{"title": "BNP-JP dispute over", "body": "After five days' hectic negotiation, the BNP-led opposition alliance yesterday resolved the dispute over composition of the All Party Action Council (APAC) as the Jatiya Party bowed down to three others parties. The structure of the APAC, finalised by the Liaison Committee on January 13, remained unchanged. As the dispute was resolved, secretaries general of the four parties also signed a circular on guidelines for formation of APACs at all levels. The circular will be sent to all district units of the parties today, with an advice for formation of APACs at all levels immediately, sources said. APACs will now be formed in all metropolises, district headquarters, municipalities, thanas, wards and unions with 'not more than 101 members' each. Each unit will have a convenor to be chosen from among local opposition leaders on consensus. The dispute had cropped up as a section of JP leadership including its Secretary General Naziur Rahman Manjur raised objection over the structure of the APAC. He had brought a number of amendments and proposed formation of a Central Steering Committee (CSC) to replace the Liaison Committee. But the proposal and the amendments were rejected by the BNP. Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote supported the BNP stance, the sources said. The dispute was resolved at meetings of the secretaries general of BNP and Jatiya Party yesterday and the day before. BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and JP chief HM Ershad had also roles in it, sources said. On Monday night, Khaleda Zia sent BNP leader Major (Retd) Manjur Qader to Ershad with a message urging him to ask Naziur to accept without any delay the APAC structure finalised earlier by the Liaison Committee. Ershad called Naziur instantly and advised him to resolve the dispute \"at any cost\" by yesterday. Naziur then invited BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and the party's representative in the Liaison Committee, M Shamsul Islam MP and Anwar Zahid, to his residence yesterday. During one and a half hour's talks from 3:30 pm, Naziur withdrew his proposals, and the meeting okayed the previous APAC structure. Mannan and Naziur then signed a circular on guidelines for formation of APACs at all levels. Secretaries general of Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikkya Jote signed it later on the day. At the meeting, both the sides agreed that from now on, secretaries general of the four parties would attend Liaison Committee meetings regularly. After the meeting, BNP hurriedly called a meeting of the Liaison Committee at the official residence of Leader of the Opposition Khakleda Zia to inform the committee about the developments. The liaison body is expected to meet again in a day or two to discuss fresh agitation programmes to be announced from separate public meetings of the four parties in the city on January 23.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bnp-jp-dispute-over", "date": "2000-01-19T00:00:09+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 461},

{"title": "India to ensure security", "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11: India Sunday pledged to protect Pakistani diplomats and cricketers from Hindu zealots who have threatened violence against them, reports AFP. \"The diplomats are safe,\" Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani said after a Hindu militant group that has vowed to disrupt Pakistan's first cricket tour of India in 12 years threatened Islamabad's diplomats as well. Advani, considered a hawk among India's ruling Hindu nationalists, said persistent differences between New Delhi and Islamabad should not be allowed to extend to sports and culture. He voiced the hope that Pakistani cricketers would tour India as scheduled for January 21 despite Hindu militants' threats to stop them from playing for alleged support by Islamabad to Indian terrorists. \"I hope they will come,\" Advani said. \"I want them to come.\" \"This (federal government) has taken appropriate action against vandalism,\" he said, adding: \"We have tried to ensure full and fool-proof security to the players.\" On Sunday, newspapers reported that police had found Hindu militant pamphlets near the Pakistan embassy here warning diplomats would be harmed if the Pakistani team arrived in India. A police officer said the two-page pamphlet was signed by the \"acting president\" of the New Delhi chapter of the Hindu militant Shiv Sena Party which rules Bombay. Security was immediately beefed up at the embassy, police said. Joint commissioner of police US Dadwal said: \"Appropriate measures have been taken for the security of the diplomats. We are trying to track down the people who have signed the pamphlets.\" Shiv Sena activists dug up the cricket pitch at the New Delhi's Ferozeshah Kotla Stadium, venue of the first Test, last week, in a bid to prevent the match. Eight Shiv Sena supporters were arrested overnight, newspapers said. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Saturday blamed \"a handful of people\" in India and Pakistan of trying to sabotage efforts to normalise relations between the two countries. The Pakistani team, which last played a Test in India in March 1987, is to arrive here January 21 for a two-Test series, the Asian Test Championship opener against India and a triangular one-day series also featuring Sri Lanka. In 1991, Hindu fanatics vandalised the pitch at Bombay's stadium days before Pakistan were to start a limited-over series in India. Pakistan cancelled that tour, and two more in 1993 and 1994, because of security fears. They played in India during the 1996 World Cup and the Independence Cup the following year without any problems. The police, meanwhile, urged newspapers in the Indian capital to report to them any information which could help prevent sabotage by Hindu militants. The militants have in the past tipped off photographers before staging violent attacks.

{"title": "Hugo Chavez: Symbol of Latin American socialism", "body": "Hugo Chavez, the symbol of Latin American socialism, passed away after a long battle against cancer. Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced in a televised address: \"We have just received the most tragic and wakeful information.\" As soon as the news was announced, supporters gathered at the city's main square, Plaza Bolivar, and began chanting \"Chavez lives, the battle continues.\" People wearing the red beret sang a popular folk song with the words, \"Those who die for life cannot be called dead.\" Chavez was given a state funeral in Caracas on March 8, attended by millions of supporters and left-wing leaders from across the globe who have been inspired by Chavez's doctrine of Bolivarian 21st century socialism. His death will also trigger a presidential election to be held within thirty days. His designated successor, Maduro, is likely to face Henrique Capriles, the losing opposition candidate in the presidential election that took place in October 2012. Until then, according to the constitution, the interim president should be the head of the national assembly. World leaders from various parts have sent massages of condolence. US President Barak Obama said: \"At this challenging time of president Hugo Chavez's passing the United States reaffirms its interest in developing a constructive relationship with the Venezuelan government. As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the US remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law and respect for human rights.\" Robert Menendez, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for free and fair elections to replace Chavez. \"Hugo Chavez ruled Venezuela with an iron hand and his passing has left a political void that we hope will be filled peacefully and through a constitutional and democratic process, grounded in the Venezuelan constitution and adhering to the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\" In June 2011, Chavez revealed that Cuban surgeons had removed a baseball-sized tumour from his pelvic region. After that he underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and two more operations in what he described as a \"battle for health and of life.\" Before the presidential elections in October 2012, aides claimed that he was well enough to complete a full term. Since his operation in December Chavez has been visited by family members and several of his closest political allies, including Fidel and Raul Castro of Cuba, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Bolivian President Evo Morales. He returned from Cuba on February 18 at his own request. Since then, he had been treated at Carlos Arvelo military hospital in Caracas. Hopes for recovery dimmed on March 4 when minister of Communications, Ernesto Villegess said that the president's condition had declined due to a new and serious respiratory infection. In 2002, he survived a short-lived coup which began after a large anti-Chavez street protest ended in deadly shootings. Dissident military officers detained the president and announced that he had resigned. But, within two days he returned to power with the help of military loyalists while his supporters rallied in the streets. Chavez emerged a stronger president. He defeated a subsequent opposition-led strike that paralysed the country's oil industry, and he fired thousands of state oil company employees. Chavez used his country's vast oil wealth to launch social programmes that include state-run food markets, new public housing, free health clinics and education programmes. Poverty declined during Chavez's presidency amid a historic boom in oil earnings . He travelled around Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Columbia and finally Cuba for the support of his movement. Fidel Castro met him and after several days they became friends. Returning to Venezuela he failed to gain mainstream media attention for his political cause. A debate soon developed in the Bolivarian movement as to whether it should try to take power in elections or whether it should instead continue to believe that military action was the only effective way of bringing about political change. Whilst remaining fiscally conservative he introduced measures in an attempt to alleviate the poverty of the Venezuelan working class. He immediately set into motion a social welfare programme called 'Plan Bolivia 2000' which he organised to begin on February 27, 1999. Plan Bolivia 2000 involved 70,000 army officers going out onto the streets of Venezuela where they would repair roads and hospitals, offer free medical care and vaccinations and sell food at cheap prices. At the start of the 21st century Venezuelan was the world's 5th largest exporter of crude oil with oil accounting for 85.3% of the country's exports. The previous government wanted to privatize this industry with US cooperation but he curbed foreign control by nationalising much of it under the state-run oil company and started spending the money mostly for public welfare purpose. On September 26, 2009 he, along with Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia, set up a regional bank. He was the most outspoken leader and often humorous critic of the US, the war in Iraq and George Bush, whom he described as a \"donkey\" and a \"devil.\" Chavez kept his nation flush with oil in exchange for its well-trained doctors and teachers. He said: \"Since I haven't failed you in the fourteen years I promise I won't fail you in the next presidential term. Because Chavez doesn't lie. Because Chavez doesn't sell out. Because Chavez is the people. Because Chavez is truth. Because all of you are Chavez. We all are.\" Really so; after his death hundreds and thousands of his followers cried \"We are Chavez.\" We salute Chavez from Bangladesh. Jorge Cashenada, former Mexican foreign minister and NBC's Latin American policy analyst said: \"Chavez will be remembered as someone who generated over fourteen years an international presence and impact beyond his own talent and personal charisma.\" Masum Billah is Program Manager: BRAC Education Program and Vice-President: Bangladesh English Language Teachers Association (BELTA) E-mail: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/hugo-chavez-symbol-of-latin-american-socialism", "date": "2013-03-11T00:00:32+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 963},
{"title": "Trade deficit narrows on sluggish imports and strong remittance flow", "body": "The trade deficit has contracted 29 percent year-on-year on the back of falling imports and rising remittance between July and January. At the end of the seventh month of fiscal 2012-13, trade deficit stood at $4.34 billion, down from the $6.14 billion recorded in the same period a year ago. Central bank officials said the reasons behind the narrowing trade deficit were the rise in exports and the drop in imports. Imports fell 3.34 percent and exports rose 8.28 percent in that period, according to Bangladesh Bank data on balance of payments. A dull investment scenario and low demand for petroleum during the period account for the decline in imports, added the officials. Import of food grains fell 40.33 percent, capital machinery 21.59 percent, industrial raw materials 6.26 percent and petroleum 3.33 percent, as per BB's letter of credit settlement statistics. Inward remittances rose around 20 percent and net foreign direct investment accelerated more than 12 percent to $785 million during the period. Consequently, the overall BoP saw a record surplus of $2.93 billion, which was $813 million in the deficit in the same period a year ago.

{"title": "The emperor's new clothes: The new Commonwealth Charter and CHOGM in Sri Lanka", "body": "Last week was the Commonwealth week. As the Commonwealth begins celebrations on the theme \"Opportunity through enterprise\" it may see its own opportunities and credibility dwindle to zero by the time its prestigious Heads of Government Meeting is held in Sri Lanka this November. According to announcements last Monday, the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM), will go ahead in Colombo despite Sri Lanka's atrocious human rights record. Ironically, last Monday was also the Commonwealth Day when the Queen signed a new Commonwealth Charter that promises human rights, rule of law and democracy. As the world prepares to censure Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council this week, the Commonwealth is preparing to honour Sri Lanka with its premier meeting, even if it is at the cost of all the values it just reiterated. This need not happen. The Commonwealth has mechanisms to scrutinise, censure, suspend and expel countries that seriously and persistently violate its core principles of democracy, rule of law and human rights, and it must use them. Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vanuatu currently make up the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) -- the Commonwealth's watchdog body. For the moment Maldives, another member, is suspended and will be discussed at its April end meeting in New York. But, the elephant in the room is Maldives' bigger island neighbour -- Sri Lanka. In 2009, Commonwealth Heads of Government initiated measures to reform the organisation and save it from irrelevance. Under pressure of reforms, in 2011 CMAG agreed to fully examine all serious or persistent violations of Commonwealth values, instead of acting against just the unconstitutional overthrow of governments. Now the proof of the pudding is in the eating. CMAG and the Commonwealth have time and again failed to arrest Sri Lanka's long running human rights abuses. Sri Lanka is instead now being rewarded with the position of hosting the Commonwealth's most prestigious meeting. This has caused great dissension among members-states and is contradictory to the opprobrium Sri Lanka faces from the international community and at the UN. The very fact that the organisation is still willing to conduct its premier meeting in a country that is being internationally charged with grave international humanitarian law violations and serious human rights abuses is enough to question the Commonwealth's commitments. Outside the Commonwealth, outrage over Sri Lanka's behaviour has been mounting steadily. In 2011, UN Secretary General's Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka found credible allegations of war crimes during the last months of Sri Lanka's civil war that concluded in 2009. This year another report commissioned by the UN Secretary General on the UN's own behaviour during that time came out with chilling and credible accusations of systematic and planned violations of humanitarian law. A report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights released last month pointed to the same violations and added that little had been done toward making those responsible accountable in any way. In every case Sri Lanka has challenged the motivation of international institutions and rejected allegations outright. Even recommendations made by a flawed domestic commission of inquiry are yet to receive any serious attention. Last year the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution on Sri Lanka asking it to at least implement these recommendations. Now, in the absence of any results, the Council is preparing for another resolution later this month. Meanwhile human rights violations continue unabated. Disappearances and crackdown on dissent has been rife, with journalists and judges being attacked and killed. The North remains militarised, amid muted and fearful allegations of abuse. Majoritarian ethno-religious extremism is on the rise in the absence of protection from the government to the populations of the country. In January Sri Lanka impeached its own chief justice and replaced her with a favourite, in the face of international clamour, through a process found illegal by the country's Supreme Court. In the absence of specific precepts, the standard for interpreting the breach of broad Commonwealth values has always depended on the moral strength of its leadership. For current leaders, it appears that internationally documented egregious wartime violations and grave ongoing abuses do not breach Commonwealth thresholds. While it is unbecoming to shelter in the vagueness of lofty values, it is even worse to gloss over specific standards. The Commonwealth's Latimer House Rules clearly lay down specific values that may not be breached. It requires that separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary are maintained without interference. The Commonwealth secretary-general has a mandate to act through his good offices in times of crisis. While what happened with the chief justice of Sri Lanka was an apparent breach of values by any reading of the Latimer House Rules, instead of holding Sri Lanka accountable, the secretary-general stated, after a recent visit, that he welcomes \"the recognition of the need for change, to ensure that any such process\" (the impeachment) \"in future is free of contention and does not call into question Sri Lanka's commitment to the independence of the judiciary and separation of powers.\" As it is now becoming apparent the secretary-general's good offices seem to be neither redeeming the Commonwealth's flagging relevance nor underscoring its credibility. CMAG's April meeting can repair all this. It has the power to formally take Sri Lanka under scrutiny and set benchmarks that need to be fulfilled. Within CMAG, Canada has already taken a strong stance. Its prime minister has said he would not attend CHOGM in Sri Lanka without substantial progress on the human rights front. Australia, which has been relatively ambiguous, has an opportunity to show its commitment to Commonwealth values. Bangladesh, as Chair, will have a vital moment to take the lead in upholding the Commonwealth's belief in democracy, rule of law and human rights.Bangladesh's own current examination of war crimes will no doubt be a clear reminder that accountability cannot and must not be buried away anywhere. Trinidad & Tobago (T&T) was host to the 2009 CHOGM that first called for Commonwealth reforms and also decided to delay Sri Lanka's offer to host the 2011 CHOGM to 2013 due to early concerns about its record. T&T, where the notion of reforms was officially born, will have the important responsibility of protecting its legacy of hosting one of the most progressive CHOGMs in Commonwealth history. Tanzania, which stood resolute in the Commonwealth's battle for justice against apartheid, will not want to see itself weak and vacillating in upholding the association's core principles. The island states of Jamaica and Vanuatu have the opportunity to indicate the power of small states in upholding values and influencing others on points of principle. With its weak and underperforming record the Commonwealth may prefer to be the proverbial ostrich that buries its head under the sand. But CMAG member states should realise that their choices at the April meeting may well be the only opportunity the Commonwealth has to right itself, if it is to escape historic ignominy and lose its credibility when Sri Lanka hosts the 2013 CHOGM. If CMAG fails to act, only sad laughter could acknowledge the Commonwealth Charter of rights that was adopted last week and the fact that its president will go on to Chair the Commonwealth till 2015.

{"title": "Session jam in JU on rise", "body": "Session jam in Jahangirnagar University (JU) is on the rise as there exists no effective measure to monitor the academic activities. \"Once reputed as the session-jam-free university, JU is now running behind the academic session by two years,\" a top university official told The Daily Star. Giving his reactions, a teacher in the Social Science Faculty, preferring anonymity, said, \"The university is lacking in leadership and the administration is busy with exercising powers, groupings and teachers' politics.\"\"Academic activities of the university did not progress due to lack of proper leadership though the situation was almost calm and quiet during the last three years,\" the teachers who is also a Syndicate member told The Daily Star. He also underscored the need for regular monitoring of academic activities. In a meeting held recently, chairpersons of the departments and deans of the faculties unanimously observed that the academic activities should be monitored regularly to restore discipline and regularity in the academic arena. Irregularity of the teachers in taking their routine classes, deteriorating teacher-student relationship, faulty examination system and unscheduled closures were identified as the main reasons for the session jam, teachers, officials and students observed while talking to this correspondent. Due to this situation, classes and examinations are not completed according to the schedule. Students and teachers also came out with contradictory versions regarding the session jam at the university. Students have alleged that a large number of teachers are not regular in taking their classes while the teachers have denied the charges right away. Blaming the students for 'sterility' and stalemate in academic activities the teachers said the students were not regular in their classes. \"Teacher-student relations have also deteriorated owing to this accusations and counter accusations,\" commented a senior professor requesting anonymity. The academic activities experienced a big blow as the university came under an unscheduled closure for 280 days during the last five years. When the university was closed sine die in 1993, academic activities remained suspended for 103 days. Another unscheduled closure claimed 51 days of the same session. In the session 1994-95, JU again suffered from unscheduled closure of 24 days, which was followed by another 54 days in 1995-96 and 13 days in the 1996-97 sessions. Triggered mainly by political unrest, students' strikes, clashes between Chhatra League and Chhatra Dal, and Islami Chhatra Shibir's armed attempt to capture the campus led to these unscheduled closures. Prior to these unrest, teachers were also assaulted by the Chhatra Dal workers in the university which led to a teachers' strike in the university. At present, there are six academic batches in the university instead of four as per the academic capacity. Examinations of the students of session 1991-92, the oldest batch, are yet to be completed while they were scheduled to pass out in 1995. Delayed by 18 months, the first year classes of the session 1996-97, began only on January 4 this year. The students of 1992-93 session have spent four years and a half to complete their three-year honours courses recently. About 18 months behind the schedule, they started their classes on December 22, 1993. Classes of the students of the session 1993-94 began on December 3, 1994 and they are scheduled to sit for their honours final examination by March next. The students of the session 1994-95 and 1995-96 started their first year classes on January 16, 1996 and February 18, 1997 respectively. Each of these batches is now set for their second year and first year examinations respectively after about 18 months in one academic year. No examination of the batches could be started according to the examination schedules set by the examination office as classes were not completed in time, examination office sources said. Abu Taher Mojumder, a senior professor of English Department held teachers' politics responsible for this situation and suggested to curtail the number of elections as the teachers have to remain busy with around five or six elections every year. \"Teachers should be dutiful and the administration should take measure to restore the teachers' accountability,\" he added, emphasising on motivation of students in this regard. A top ranking official in the Registrar Building said, \"The administration is aware of the absentee teachers, but no action is taken against them fearing agitation and pressure by teachers' groups aimed at attaining their political gain. \"Regular monitoring of academic activities is a must to eliminate the session jam,\" he added. Talking to The Daily Star, president of JU Teachers' Association (JUTA) Prof Jasimuddin Ahmed said, \"Authorities should have integrity to ensure academic progress.\"\"Authority's lack of integrity is proved through the rare holding of meetings of academic Council,\" he continued. Referring to the academic calendar preferred recently, he said, \"Academic calendar would be meaningless if it is not implemented.\"The vice-Chancellor of the university Prof Amirul Islam Chowdhury said, \"We have prepared an academic calendar and it will be implemented in taming the academic backlog.\"\"Examination system has been revamped and we have been monitoring academic activities regularly to improve the situation,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/session-jam-in-ju-on-rise", "date": "1998-02-03T00:00:30+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 836},

PHOTO: AFP Colin Ingram hit an unbeaten century to set up a comfortable 125-run win for South Africa in the first one-day international against Pakistan at Chevrolet Park on Sunday. The left-handed Ingram made 105 not out as South Africa piled up 315 for four after being sent in to bat. Pakistan could only make 190 in reply. Ingram made his runs off 103 balls with ten fours. It was his third one-day international century and his second against Pakistan. He shared partnerships of 120 for the third wicket with captain AB de Villiers (65), 62 for the fourth wicket with Faf du Plessis (26) and 50 off only 23 balls with Farhaan Behardien, who hammered 34 not out off 14 deliveries. Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla set an aggressive tone with an opening partnership of 72 after South Africa were sent in, with both batsmen going for their shots against Junaid Khan and Umar Gul despite the Pakistan new ball bowlers getting some early assistance from the pitch. The South Africans opted for the batting power play immediately after the compulsory first ten overs but lost Smith when he gloved an attempted reverse sweep to be caught behind off Saeed Ajmal, one of four spin bowlers in the six-man bowling attack, for 30. Amla made 43 before he was caught at deep square leg off Mohammad Hafeez. De Villiers and Ingram then set South Africa on the way to a big total with a run-a-ball stand during which they kept the score moving quickly against the Pakistan spin bowlers with deft placement and good running between wickets. Pakistan made a bright start with Mohammad Hafeez and Nasir Jamshed putting on 42 for the first wicket off 43 balls before the suffered a double blow. Jamshed was caught at slip by Graeme Smith off Rory Kleinveldt for 25 and Hafeez fell for the same score in unlucky fashion when a drive by Younis Khan was deflected by bowler Kleinveldt into the stumps for Hafeez to be run out. Asad Shafiq fell cheaply and Pakistan were unable to build substantial partnerships with captain Misbahul Haq top-scoring with 38. Shahid Afridi hit 34 off 16 balls before he was last man out but his innings was never likely to alter the outcome. Afridi hit three sixes, including a massive strike which sailed out of the ground and into a car park. Kleinveldt, whose first two balls were hit for four, came back strongly to finish with four for 22 in 5.2 overs, while Ryan McLaren took three for 19. The win gave South Africa a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. The second match will be in Centurion on Friday. .SCORES IN BRIEF SOTH AFRICA: 315 for 4 (Smith 30, Amla 43, De Villiers 65, Ingram 105 not out, Du Plessis 26, Behardien 34 not out; Ajmal 2-53) PAKISTAN: 190 all out (Hafeez 25, Jamshed 25, Younis 30, Misbah 38, Malik 19, Afridi 34; Kleinveldt 4-22, McLaren3-19) Result: South Africa won by 125 runs.

{"title": "Fracas in BB", "body": "Bangladesh Bank, the central bank of the country, looks diminutive today after what happened within its precincts on Monday. The rumpus was on a high dare-devilry rating with 40-50 employees storming into GM (admn)'s chamber and ransacking it to a point where he had to duck under the table only to be a sitting target for kicks and punches from the intruders. The GM desperately ran for shelter at the governor's chamber. There he and the Bangladesh Bank governor paid audience to spiteful remarks with a blistering demand shouted at them for their immediate removal from office. All this was said to be the handiwork of Bangladesh Bank Employees' Association, the vanquished party in the last CBA election which was won by Bangladesh Bank Karmachari Samity with a narrow margin. Although no organisation supporting any political party is legally allowed to function in Bangladesh Bank, some reports suggested that the incumbent Karmachari Samity has had a pro-BNP image while its rival Employees Association has been known for its leanings toward the AL. Some leaders of the party which had lost the election demanded transfer of a few key officials allegedly responsible for victimising their supporters. The GM apparently refused to concede this angering them a good deal. Some observers even tend to look at it as part of a scheme plotted outside the bank to exert pressure on the governor lest he took some decisions which were on the anvil. If it is a case of rivalry between the election winner and the loser then it needs to be addressed by utmost neutrality in the administration and by reminding all concerned that they are debarred from showing off any clout of national political parties, overtly or covertly, according to BB rules. We would like to see deterrent action taken on the culprits and an uncovering done of the machinations behind the outburst, if any. This looked like a tall order for the 3-member inquiry committee headed by Harinarayan Majumder, an executive director of Bangladesh Bank, especially when he was given 24 hours to file the report.

{"title": "Dilemma for BJP", "body": "The two-party system is still a far cry in India. In fact, if one were to add up national and regional parties, the number comes to around 30. Still, three formations have come to emerge. There is the Bharatiya Janata Party, with 12 regional allies, Congress with six and the United Front retaining the 14-party alliance. What it means is that no political party will get a clear majority in the next Lok Sabha because they have themselves limited the scope of winning 272 in a house of 543. They share seats with the parties with their allies. The BJP, which once said that it would go it alone, has realised that it has to have the support of other parties. No doubt, the argument is that this time its purpose is to create a niche in the south and the other non-Hindi speaking states and to fight on its own in the elections that will follow the present one. Yet, it is an admission that it cannot come to power on its own. The coalition, which it ran down in the past, has come to be accepted as the future pattern. This has naturally diluted the BJP's poll plank. It argues that the party has no other option in the political climate that prevails in the country. This is true. What it does not realise is that when it would want to return to its own agenda, the territory vacated by it might have been occupied by the fanatics. It would be increasingly under pressure to go back to its original stand. But the party is in no position to disturb the set up it has so labouriously built in the states, where it does not count. The question it should ask itself is : Can it pursue the diluted programme without alienating its committed voters? So far the BJP has stood for a stridentHindutva, which has been spelled out in the terms of Hindu Rashtriya, the common civil code, the scrapping of Article 370, which gives a special status to Kashmir, and the building of Ram temple at the site where the Babri masjid stood before demolition. The removal of the mosques sharing the premises of temples at Mathura and Varanasi has been deferred for the time-being. It is no more a secret that the parties with which the BJP has aligned itself are against such demands. Some of the allies have said so publicly. In fact, the very dilution has attracted the parties which were opposed to the BJP earlier. Its leader, Atal Behari Vajpyee, has said that the BJP will not pursue its own programme because it will have to accommodate the programmes of other parties. It is a good statement to cement relations with the allies but is it good enough for the BJP's traditional voters? When the Jana Sangh, before it was rechristined as BJP, had a stand which was wishy-washy. Then it never crossed a double digit in the Lok Sabha. It was able to increase its tally to 90 in 1977 after Gandhian Jaiprakash Narayan made them it of the Janta Party, which swept the polls in the wake of Mrs Indira Gandhi's authoritarian rule. But then came a stage when the Jana Sangh members had to choose between the RSS, its mentor, and the Janata Party. They left the Janata Party and founded the BJP. LK Advani then announced that they would go it alone. That was the time when they began to play the Hindu card. The new policy was focused on an appeal to Hindus in the name of religion and it articulated such causes as would foment religious sentiments, to the exclusion and discomfort of the Muslims and secular forces. There were pressures on the BJP to give up its Hindutva stand to expand its base. But the BJP did not change. It reaped the dividends and, as a result, its number rose to 161 in the last Lok Sabha. The party became the single largest group in the House. It was evident that the stand of Hindu chauvinism won them seats. The voters, who have stood behind it, have a specific image of the party. Can it now turn its back to them and say that it has changed or diluted its policy because of certain considerations? The danger in such an eventuality is that those who have put faith in the BJP because of its Hindu face may feel betrayed and may even distance themselves from it. It is difficult to believe that the BJP will do so, particularly when the RSS is the boss. Only the other day did I see Vajpayee in knickers, standing in salute before RSS Chief Raju Bhaya, published in a newspaper. The cat is out of the bag. How can the BJP which is an instrument of the RSS can make a departure from the basic philosophy of Hindu Rashtriya. It would tantamount to the tail wagging the body. In fact, RSS ideologue Govindacharya let the cat out of the bag when he said an interview that it was \"practical idealism\". It meant the party has adopted a strategy for winning. He went on to explain: \"It may also be termed as a tactical act of self-defence.\" What Govindacharya said was that the situation demanded the BJP to act in a particular way so that it could have alliance with different parties in different parts of India. But 'practical idealism' is the not a phrase which the BJP supporters in rural areas will understand, presuming that the urbanites will. They have hitched their wagon to the BJP because it held out certain promises, the promises of Hidutva, common civil code, etc. They may not appreciate the point of strategy, which the BJP emphasises, to get a foothold in the south, Orissa or West Bengal. The diluted stand of the BJP may make fanatic bodies like the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) more attractive. However, the only saving grace for the BJP is that the VHP is also an instrument of the RSS. It will see to it that VHP does not come in the way of the BJP. In any case, Govindacharya's observations should be a warning to persons like George Fernandes and Ram Krishna Hegde, still parading as anti-communal in their approach. They say that the BJP has changed. If it is a strategy, then how? The RSS ideologue argues that it is 'practical' to pursue the line which the party has taken at present. To read anything more than that is foolish. Fernandes and Hegde are seasoned enough to know that. By associating with parties which, till recently, had secular credentials, the BJP expects the percentage of votes (20.29 per cent as against 20.80 per cent by Congress) it polled in the last election to increase. People sitting on the fence or those who have weakened in their faith in secularism have already begun to feel that the BJP is after all not that communal when people like Fernandes, Hedge and MGK Menon, the renowned scientist, have joined hands with it. The real danger that the BJP faces is that in an effort to win the non-BJP voters it may lose some of its support. Its appeal is on the basis of clothes ofHindutva it wears. By putting on some other clothes, it may be found acceptable but it may lose the people who have stood by it for years. The fielding of LK Advani, so far saying 'no' to the Lok Sabha, is meant probably to sustain the hopes of hardliners that all that the BJP is doing is to get a majority. If, by a quirk of circumstances, it attains 272 seats in the Lok Sabha on its own symbol, Advani would be the prime minister. If the majority is through the allies, the soft Vajpayee would occupy the chair. And, in any case, Govindacharya has made it clear that Vajpayee is only a 'mask'.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/dilemma-for-bjp", "date": "1998-01-27T00:00:13+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1328},

{"title": "Acute water shortage grips Ctg South Halishahar", "body": "Some unscrupulous residents of South Halishahar of Chittagong city are making a quick buck by illegally selling water obtained from domestic connections, causing an acute water shortage. With water available in the mains for only 24 hours every week, these residents, usually housed at the entrance of alleys, use powerful motors to quickly fill their reserve tanks. This leaves other residents living farther down the alleys with very little or no water at all, compelling them to sometimes purchase it from these illegal water traders. The acute water shortage became prominent since October 2011, when Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) decided to provide water in South Halishahar from Tuesday noon to Wednesday noon. “As soon as water arrives, these traders fill up numerous jars and large reserve tanks in their houses to sell later on,” said Abul Hossain, a resident suffering from the water shortage. Every day over 1,500 jars, each with a capacity of 20 litres, are sold to different households, shops, restaurants and businesses for Tk 20 each, said Abul. “We requested these traders to stop their business for at least two hours so that we can collect water for our households, but they do not pay heed to our request,” he added. A good number of these traders are active in Cement Crossing, Bandartilla, Kazir Goli, Alishah Para and Narikel Tola areas under South Halishahar. On a visit to Narikel Tola recently, a number vans filled with water jars were found parked outside some houses. The locals were quick to name some of the traders -- Mohammed Rafiq, Khalil, Jasim Uddin, Alamgir, Jamal Uddin, Shahnoor and Nur Mohammed. Jasim was found filling a jar on his yard and admitted of his involvement. Shahnoor, Jasim's neighbour, said, “You can find nearly 100 others involved in this business. If the business is illegal then Chittagong Wasa would have taken action against us.” Accusing Chittagong Wasa officials of taking bribes to remain silent on the issue, the locals said to have made several complaints to a metre reader of Chittagong Wasa, Md Kamal Khan, with no result. Admitting that he had received the complaints, Kamal claimed that he had not found the traders “red handed”. The locals said if Chittagong Wasa and other authorities concerned do not take steps immediately, more people would be encouraged into the illicit business and cause a huge amount of revenue loss. Chittagong Wasa charges Tk 6.57 per 1,000 litres of water from domestic consumers while the rate is Tk 18.62 for commercial consumers. Running a water supply business requires traders to have, among others, a license from Chittagong City Corporation, a commercial connection from Chittagong Wasa, and approvals from Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution, Department of Public Health Engineering and the district civil surgeon. None of the traders have the aforementioned. Chittagong Wasa Chief Revenue Officer Khaled Mahmud said, “We do not allow anyone to sell Wasa water until they have commercial connections, water plants and the approvals required.” He said mobile courts would be conducted in the areas once every week.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/acute-water-shortage-grips-ctg-south-halishahar", "date": "2013-03-16T00:13:46+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 510},

{"title": "Health chiefs caught stealing Tk 20 cr", "body": "The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health Ministry has detected massive corruption in procurement by six civil surgeons who are alleged to have misappropriated over Tk 20 crore in the last financial year. They were in charge of buying medical equipment, furniture and fittings for Sadar hospitals and thana health complexes. Price of a 25-taka 60-watt ordinary bulb was shown at Tk 1852, a 400-taka steel tray at Tk 17,000, a 3,000-taka steel rack at Tk 24,000 and that of a two-taka blood testing slide at Tk 13. These are some of the examples of glaring irregularities done in the purchase of equipment for hospitals in Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Naogaon, Chapainawabganj and Munshiganj districts, according to a committee report. In some cases, equipment and furniture were purchased without any requisition from the thana health complexes concerned and vouchers did not tally with work orders in some others. The report said that the civil surgeons of the six districts gave the work orders, and that the irregularities were done by them in connivance with the suppliers and some officials of the ministries of heath and finance. Most surprisingly, funds were released from the finance ministry without delay. In many cases, funds were disbursed on the day bills were submitted. A deputy secretary and a senior assistant secretary of the health ministry and an assistant secretary of the finance ministry were involved in the irregularities and the officials did not inform their higher authorities about disbursement of the funds, the report said. The report was prepared after five months' investigation by a sub-committee headed by Tajul Islam. The report was submitted to the Chairman of the Standing Committee Dr. Kazi Abu Yusuf last week and its findings were the main topic of discussion at its Wednesday's meeting, sources said. The Committee recommended that the persons involved be suspended immediately, misappropriated funds refunded and inquiry started by the Anti-corruption Bureau and the health ministry. Investigation against eight more civil surgeons on purchase of hospital equipment are going on now, the sources said. The report also said that such irregularities had been going on at least for the last 15 years but could not be detected despite repeated allegations because earlier reports by parliamentary standing committees were often found \"biased\" as those were headed by the health minister. Among the six, Naogaon district civil surgeon allegedly misappropriated the highest amount of Tk 7.56 crore, according to the report. The funds, as shown by the civil surgeon's office, were used for purchasing new furniture, wall painting and repair work. In one lot, price of a 400-taka steel tray was shown at Tk 17,000 in the voucher and the contractor was Messrs Prema Enterprise of Rajshahi, the report revealed. The security money deposited was only Tk 10,000 whereas as per rules at least five per cent of the contract value is to be deposited as security money. The report also mentioned that the civil surgeon, after spending the amount, had asked for an extra MSR (Medical and Surgical Requisition) allocation of Tk 7 crore. It was however, refused later on. For Lalmornirhat district, the extra amount allocated was Tk 4.19 crore. The contractor who supplied the items was Taslim Uddin of Shehab Bazar, Rajshahi. The contractor had supplied 4 -inch leucoplast medicated dressing to the Civil Surgeon's office at the rate of Tk 480 each whereas its retail price in the market is only Tk 35. A saucepan was shown to have cost Tk 7,400, which normally costs not more than Tk 400. In Gaibandha, steel racks worth Tk 3,000 each were purchased at the rate of Tk 24,000, 80-taka buckets at Tk 450 and 25-taka 60-watt ordinary bulbs at the rate of Tk 1852 each. The civil surgeon of Kurigram spent an extra amount Tk 1.2 crore. In Munshiganj, the extra amount for MSR was Tk 3.74 crore. Four lakh pieces of blood testing slides were bought at the rate of Tk 13 each against the price of only Tk 2 and 30,000 pieces of hand gloves at the rate of Tk 140 each against the market price of Tk 15 only. The contractor was Tofazzal Hossain of Rajshahi. The names of the civil surgeons are Dr Shamsuddin Ahmed of Kurigram, Dr Abdus Samad and former civil surgeon Sheikh Abdul Jalil of Lalmonirhat, Dr MD Shahidullah of Gaibanda, Dr Abdullah Hashemi of Naogaon, Dr Binod Bihari Shaha of Chapai Nawabganj and Dr Azizur Rahman of Munshiganj.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/health-chiefs-caught-stealing-tk-20-cr", "date": "1999-01-01T00:00:56+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 740},

Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix said his teams had so far found no \"smoking gun\" but added Iraq had failed to answer many questions about its armaments. Baghdad said it would do so. Washington appeared unimpressed with Blix's double-edged comments. \"The problem with guns that are hidden is you can't see their smoke,\" a White House spokesman told reporters. \"We know for a fact that there are weapons there.\" Blix's remarks, made to reporters as he prepared to brief members of the UN Security Council, were interpreted by the markets as making war more likely, and oil prices quickly rose. In the nearly seven weeks since inspections resumed in Iraq, he said, \"we have been covering the country in ever-wider sweeps, and we haven't found any smoking guns.\" But Blix, head of chemical, biological and ballistic arms inspections, said he was dissatisfied with the 12,000-page document Iraq submitted in December after the UN Security Council demanded it give a full account of its arms programs. \"We think that the declaration failed to answer a great many questions,\" Blix said.\" He said it was up to Iraq to show it did not have banned weapons, not for his staff to prove it did. \"Iraq cannot just maintain that it must be deemed to be without proscribed items as long as there is no evidence to the contrary,\" he said. AP adds: Weapons inspectors have delivered a tough message to Iraq: Opening doors and submitting old declarations isn't enough to satisfy the United Nations, and Baghdad must prove that its arms programs have been destroyed. Chief inspector Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, who is in charge of nuclear inspections, told the UN Security Council on Thursday they have found no \"smoking gun\" since UN inspections resumed on Nov. 27 - but that doesn't mean there isn't one.

{"title": "Forex reserves cross $25b", "body": "Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves crossed $25 billion yesterday, setting a new record. The reserve of $25.02 billion is enough to meet the country's import bills for more than seven months, Kazi Sayedur Rahman, general manager of the forex reserve and treasury management department of Bangladesh Bank, told The Daily Star. The reserves first crossed the $23-billion mark on February 26 and $24 billion on April 29 this year. The central bank attributed this large reserve sum to export earnings, remittance, foreign direct investment and the private sector's foreign-sourced loans. Declining import bills for food grains and petroleum oils also played an important role in fuelling the reserve, according to a statement by the central bank. Exports grew only 2.8 percent to $28.14 billion and remittances 7.21 percent to $13.87 billion in July-May of the outgoing fiscal year, compared to the same period in the previous year, according to data from the central bank. On the other hand, imports (freight on board-basis) increased more than 12 percent to $33.46 billion during the first 10 months of the fiscal year till April. According to analysts, the private sector's increasing dependence on loans from foreign sources has had a major role in the country's forex reserves figure every month. Government data shows that the private sector took $4.89 billion in loans from abroad in 2014, up from $4.06 billion and $1.79 billion in 2013 and 2012 respectively. The growing reserves of foreign currency have helped the central bank maintain a stable exchange rate over the last couple of years and provided a more favourable economic environment. However, fluctuations in the exchange markets can result in gains and losses in the purchasing power of reserves. For example, Bangladesh holds a majority of its reserves in US dollar-denominated assets, and if the dollar weakens, it will result in a relative loss of wealth.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/business/forex-reserves-cross-25b-103024", "date": "2015-06-26T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 308},

{"title": "Cannes waves flag for US auteur films by giving top prize to \"Elephant\"", "body": "France's love-hate relationship with US cinema remained intact Monday after the Cannes movie festival bestowed its Palme d'Or on an auteur film by US director Gus Van Sant that confronts America's problem with violence. \"Elephant\", a documentary-style movie about a school massacre that strongly resembled the real-life 1999 Columbine high school shootings, took the coveted award at the closing ceremony in this French Riviera town Sunday. In doing so, it elbowed past 19 other contenders, including \"Dogville\", the latest production by Cannes' favourite son, the Danish director Lars von Trier, which almost all critics had expected to win. Van Sant, who is best-known for \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Drugstore Cowboy\" and \"My Own Private Idaho\", also picked up the Best Director prize -- an unusual double honour from the nine-person Cannes jury that this year included US director Steven Soderbergh and actress Meg Ryan. \"To win is kind of miraculous and fortunate and lucky,\" Van Sant told a media conference after receiving the awards. He was the first American to win the prestigious Palme since Quentin Tarantino took it for \"Pulp Fiction\" in 1994. His film, made for a US cable network on a meagre three-million-dollar (2.5 million euro) budget with a mostly non-professional cast of real students in a school in the American west, was not meant as a criticism of America but more \"a musing about school violence,\" he said. The title came from a highly acclaimed 1989 BBC documentary about Northern Ireland. Diversity is one of Cannes' signature themes, however, and that was reinforced with the award of the runner-up Grand Prize to \"Distant\", a Turkish film by Nuri Bilge Ceylan that explores the emptiness of life and loneliness in the city. A French-language Canadian film, \"The Barbarian Invasions\", that was probably the most popular entry seen in the week and a half long festival, earned a Best Screenplay award for its writer and director, Denys Arcand. It also took the Best Actress prize for Marie-Josee Croze, who played a heroin junky helping a dying man cope with his pain. Overlooked was the Clint Eastwood-directed \"Mystic River\", a psychological thriller that used its all-star cast of Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins to good effect. For many of the 30,000 industry types and journalists accredited to the event, and for the tens of thousands more movie fans who flocked to the Riviera for a glimpse of celebrities, the real high point came early on, with the out-of-competition premiere of \"The Matrix Reloaded\" in the presence of Keanu Reeves and its other stars. Little else lived up to Cannes' reputation for over-the-top cinematic hype except for Arnold Schwarzenegger's shameless plugging of his upcoming and as-yet unseen \"Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines\" in a seaside publicity show and exclusive party. Many of the official screenings seemed to be grim celebrations of death.

PHOTO: AFP It's always a pleasant experience to hear a player like Kumar Sangakkara speak. One of Sri Lanka's biggest sports personalities spoke like his bat's gentle touch after the first day's play at the Galle Test against Bangladesh where he made a splendid hundred. The following is an excerpt from the freewheeling encounter with reporters at the press briefing room of the Galle International Cricket Stadium yesterday. Question (Q): How satisfying it is to back to runs after the injury lay-off? Sangakkara (S): Very satisfying. Going into this match I had only batted three or four days and I had worked really hard on those sessions. I really wanted to get off the first ball and I was lucky that it was short and wide. That really gives you lot of confidence and after that it was a case of getting my rhythm back. Q: How difficult is it after Matara episode? S: You get used to this kind of things (as he was called back from Matara following the crisis between the players and the board). You have to be a bigger person and you need to get your preparation right. Such is life and my job is to get ready for the Test Match and that was what I was concentrating on. Q: Say something about the hundred? S: My idea was that the bowlers were tired and I wanted to get past 300. If we are able to pass 300 on day one that makes it easy to make a declaration after a session or so in the second day. Lahiru Thirimanne was batting really well and my job was to try and accelerate and score runs quicker so that the team will be in a good position. 361 is a good score and it gives us a position to bat first one session and then Angelo can decide when he wants to declare. Q: How does it feel to pass Sunny Gavaskar? S: He was a fantastic batsman. I am very privileged to have had a career where I am able to go past him. Still I am two centuries (actually three) behind him. Hopefully I can go beyond him on that count too. Q: See any improvement in Bangladesh bowling? S: They have had bowlers who have come and gone. Unfortunately most of their bowlers haven't had a consistent run in the national side. Mashrafe Mortaza I think was their best bowler. He can swing the ball and I have found him difficult to play. They have always had spinners, who bowl well but unfortunately their best spinner Shakib is not here. But still they have been that unpredictable side. The fast bowler Abul Hasan was very quick. He has got something in him. But over the years, bowling has been inconsistent. But I am sure they have lot of depth and they will be looking for consistency as they go along. Q: How do you feel about missing yet another double hundred? S: It was disappointing. But If I had got to 160 or 170 and had the team been past 300 then I would have blocked, but it wasn't to be and that's the way it goes. Q: There is talk about Sri Lankan's greatest batsman being between you, Mahela and Aravinda de Silva, how do you look at this matter? S: I would go with Aravinda an Mahela. There's Anura Tennekoon and Roy Dias as well. If you ask Sir Viv Richards, he always says, 'Tennekoon, Dias, de Silva' 'Tennekoon, Dias, de Silva'. When Sir Viv says you listen. He knows what he is talking about. I don't put myself in that category. I have scored lot of runs, but they made batting look a lot easier than I do. Q: Is there anything to prove after contract issue? S: It's never about proving anything. The only person you prove is yourself. Q: How does it feel to get equal with Mahela's hundreds? S: It's a great privilege. Getting runs and scoring more hundreds – sometimes you can say there is a selfish element, but if you keep doing that, you benefit and your side benefits as well. Q: What is the secret behind your great success? S: There's no secret. It's just working hard. When I made my debut I thought I was very lucky, But then I realised it was about doing as much work as you can the right way. I've been lucky to have a long career. It's just that really. Q: Next goal? S: More centuries, more runs and more wins. I think that's what motivates all the guys who play.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/you-only-prove-to-yourself", "date": "2013-03-09T00:00:55+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 808},

There are two groups in the organisation, one led by its former president Saidur Rahman and the other by former general secretary Tawhid Reza Nur. The two groups have been organising separate programmes on different occasions for some time now. A central executive committee of the organisation was formed when it was floated on October 29, 1991. The tenure of the committee expired after two years but no new committee was formed. The group led by Saidur Rahman at a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club yesterday announced a 25-member central committee with Anwarul Kabir Milu and Hedayet Hossain as president and general secretary. The new committee was rejected by the other group calling it \"unconstitutional and illegal\". Saidur Rahman claimed at the press conference that formation of a new committee become urgent as some office-bearers of the former committee, including general secretary Tawhid Reza Nur had made the organisation inactive by not doing any organisational activities. Saidur also alleged that leaders of the other group had met the Prime Minister without taking any opinion from the then president and majority of the office-bearers of the organisation. Nur, leader of the other group in a statement yesterday alleged that the new committee was formed secretly, ignoring the opinion of the majority and violating the constitution of the organisation. The statement was signed by six office-bearers of the former committee. Nur alleged that leaders of the other group remained inactive due to differences on principles and had been using the organisation for petty personal interest. Nur claimed that they organised Muktijuddaha Mela and Bijoy Mela, observed the death anniversary of Jahanara Imam, donated money to the Prime Minister's Relief Fund and met the Prime Minister after taking opinion from majority of the office-bearers. Under this circumstances, the committee declared yesterday is \"illegal\" and majority members of the Projonmo '71 can not accept it, he said in the statement. The statement was also signed by former vice- president Rabiul Aftab, joint secretaries Ashif Munir and Salma Nargis, publication secretary Farzana Chowdhury Nipa and publicity secretary Babul Chowdhury Dey. At the press conference Saidur also put forward some demands including formation of a Shaheed Family Welfare Trust, housing facility for the families of martyrs, for welfare of the children of the martyrs. The demands include housing facilities for, setting up of separate liberation war based museum both centrally and locally, preparation of a definite list of the martyrs of 1971 and invitation of martyrs families in all state functions, formation of a Shaheed Family Welfare Trust and observance of national mourning day in honour of the 3 millions martyrs of the war of independence.

{"title": "No lazybones in Tigers’ dressing room", "body": "Bangladesh cricket team’s strength and conditioning coach Mario Villavarayan dismisses the notion that the players are indolent when it comes to fitness and appreciates their commitment to look after themselves, especially when he is not around. When Mario became a part of the coaching staff last year, he was under the impression that the Bangladeshi cricketers were lazy and not too keen on fitness. In a matter of months, Tigers’ strength and conditioning coach found out how committed the players were even in the most taxing of circumstances. \"When I was coming here I was given this impression that guys are not that keen on fitness. The biggest thing that hit me was that last year in July during Ramadan, we were doing running sessions at 3.30 pm in the afternoon.” Mario Villavarayan said. \"These boys were fasting but they were running and pushing themselves. Those first few weeks proved I was given a wrong impression about the boys. From that point they have gone on well,\" he added. Although some of the players have suffered injuries, the bigger picture is still bright for Bangladesh says Mario. It takes time for the fitness levels of cricketers to improve markedly, and that also depends heavily on what they do when out of Mario’s supervision. The professionalism shown by Bangladeshi cricketers in this regard has impressed the strength and conditioning coach during his tenure. \"I look after them here. When they go home, they have to look after themselves. That is what I have seen improved. They get into good habits and they are doing it at home. It is the main thing. This is the professionalism coming in,” Mario explained. “If they are not going to do it when I am not around, they are not going to help themselves,\" he said. Mario now has to look after the Bangladesh players as the grueling season continues with South Africa due to play 2 T20Is, 3 ODIs and 2 Test matches in July. The post-World Cup phase included the BCL one-day tournament, Pakistan’s tour and the India series in quick succession.

{"title": "Chauhan, Dharmasena chuck?", "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 3: Off-spinners Rajesh Chauhan of India and Kumara Dharmasena of Sri Lanka can't play international cricket until they rectified their suspect bowling actions, a top official of the International Cricket Council said Saturday, reports AP. The ICC technical committee recently watched the video footage of their bowling actions and ruled that Chauhan and Dharmasena threw the ball, Press Trust of India news agency quoted ICC chief Jagmohan Dalmiya as saying. The ICC acted on a complaint by Bob Simpson of Australia who was the match referee for the recent three-Test series between India and Sri Lanka. The ICC will provide a specialist to help Chauhan and Dharmasena correct their bowling actions and resume playing for their countries, Dalmiya said. Dharmasena is the second Sri Lankan player to be involved in such a controversy. In 1996, Sri Lanka's off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan was no-balled several times by an Australian umpire for suspect bowling action. But he was later cleared to play international cricket. Cricket selectors on Saturday dropped a spin bowler from the Indian cricket team because of his faulty bowling action, Press Trust of India news agency said. The decision followed a ruling by the technical committee of the International Cricket Council that off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan threw the ball, said J Y Lele, secretary of Indian cricket control board. ICC had communicated the finding of its sub-committee to BCCI and the selectors, on the basis of that letter, omitted Chauhan from the 14-man squad for the January 10-18 Bangladesh silver jubilee independence cup tournament as they did not want the bowler to be no-balled there for his action, Lele said. Lele said the ICC match referee for the India-Sri Lanka Test series, Australia's Bob Simpson, had reported to the world body about his and several umpires' concern over the legitimacy of the bowling action of Chauhan. The ICC letter would have gone everywhere and Chauhan could have been called by an umpire at Dhaka, Lele said while adding that BCCI would support the bowler in correcting his action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/chauhan-dharmasena-chuck", "date": "1998-01-04T00:00:51+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 340},

{"title": "Former President Biswas says", "body": "Former President Abdur Rahman Biswas yesterday said that during his presidency, his speeches in the Parliament were endorsed by the Prime Minister and her office. Talking to UNB in the wake of a controversy kicked up by the opposition over the issue, he said, his presidential speeches used to contain two parts - objective and subjective. The objective part, mainly containing accounts of various development programmes and achievements of the government, was prepared by different ministries, while the subjective one, on matters like one Liberation War, contribution of national leaders to democracy and independence, was drafted by the President's Office. \"However, finally the entire speech of the President used to be seen and cleared by the Prime Minister and her office,\" said Biswas, who was president from 1991-96 and was elected as a BNP nominee. The former president said he found nothing wrong in the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, endorsing the draft speech. Biswas, however, said that any additions or omissions from the draft speech were done on the basis of understanding between the head of state and the head of government. Biswas declined to make any comment on the opposition boycott of his successor's speech, delivered in Parliament yesterday, on objection that it was endorsed by the cabinet eulogising the government's programmes and performances. Praising President Shahabuddin Ahmed as a neutral and respected man, Biswas said Shahabuddin was accepted by all. \"Even BNP gladly accepted him although he was nominated by Awami League.\" Asked to comment on whether a president could make his personal comments aside the scripted address to the Parliament, Biswas said as a matter of fact the President has nothing to say in addition to the prepared speech cleared by the Prime Minister and the cabinet. As per the present Constitution, the President is to act on advice of the Prime Minister, excepting imitating the leader of the majority party in forming government and giving appointment to the Chief Justice and to other constitutional posts. Biswas, however, recalled that while addressing the first session of the 6th Parliament, elected through a controversial election on February 15, 1996, as President he made certain comments which were little critical of BNP. And those comments earned protests from the BNP government as well. \"BNP had raised objection to certain parts of that speech, but I insisted that those points should be there,\" said the former President. About the opposition boycott of municipal elections, Biswas refrained from making comment since he is no longer in active politics. \"It is difficult on my part to comment since I was associated with a political party,\" Biswas said on the opposition boycott of President Shahabuddin Ahmed's speech in the first Parliament session of this year. He, however, suggested that both the ruling and opposition parties should close the gap and settle all differences through discussion. \"Otherwise, parliamentary democracy would fail,\" he forewarned. \"I love to call a spade a spade. Had I been in active politics, I would have suggested that both the government and opposition should thrash out the differences because democracy means discussion and settling all differences.\" The former President added: \"It would not be good to push the country towards a stalemate.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/former-president-biswas-says", "date": "1999-01-26T00:00:16+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 534},

The intermediate-range surface-to-surface Hatf-V missile, known as Ghauri, was presented to President Pervez Musharraf in his capacity as army chief during a formal ceremony at a nuclear research plant on the outskirts of Islamabad on Wednesday. General Musharraf said it was \"a proud day for him to be accepting the Ghauri system on behalf of the Army's Strategic Force Command,\" military spokesman Major General Rashid Qureshi quoted him as saying. The Ghauri's induction into the army \"would radiate the necessary effects of deterrence,\" Musharraf said. With a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles), the missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead deep into Indian territory. It was handed over by the directors of A.Q. Khan Research Laboratory (KRL), named after Abdul Qadeer Khan, the scientist who developed Pakistan's first nuclear weapon. \"It is the first time a nuclear-capable ballistic missile has been inducted into the army,\" political observer Mohammad Afzal Niazi told AFP. The Ghauri was first tested in April 1998, one month before Pakistan and India conducted tit-for-tat underground nuclear tests. It was test-fired again in April 1999 and as tensions between Pakistan and India peaked in May last year. The missile is named after a Muslim warrior who defeated Indian ruler Prithvi Chauhan in the late 12th century. The induction ceremony, closed to the media, was attended by top generals, nuclear scientists and engineers. The Ghauri, painted in camouflage khaki and grey colours, was wheeled out of a workshop mounted on a truck and driven past Musharraf and other top brass, military-issued photographs showed. The KRL laboratory is involved in enrichment of weapons-grade uranium, used to build nuclear weapons, and missile development. The Dawn newspaper on Wednesday reported that US officials believe Khan initiated contact with North Korea in 1992 to obtain a dozen medium-range Nodong ballistic missiles.

The judge made the observation in response to a reported statement of Deputy Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Mollah Nazrul Islam that they (police) will have the DNA of five detained NSU students tested if necessary. Mollah's statement was published on the daily Prothom Alo yesterday.

{"title": "Clinton's 'New Age' Diplomacy", "body": "Moral precepts are absolute and make no allowance for historical evolution. When thwarted, they allow no fall-back. But foreign policy must deal with nuances and processes rather than terminal points. Public relations myths - or worse, self-delusion - cannot serve as a substitute. New Age diplomacy has not abolished the need to strike a balance between a society's ideals and the necessities of its place in the world. The end of the millennium coincides with the moment when America's pre-eminence turned into predominance. Never before has a single country achieved a comparable ascendancy on a global basis and in so many fields of endeavour, from weaponry to entrepreneurship, from technology to popular culture. The American ascendancy finds the United States acting as the bulwark of stability, mediating the key trouble spots and stationing troops around the world in peacekeeping missions that shade into near permanent occupation duties. America dominates the international financial system by providing the most attractive haven for investment capital as well as the largest single pool of it. Yet America's dominance has expressed itself less as a strategic design than as a series of seemingly unrelated decisions taken largely in response to specific crises and driven less by an overarching concept than by responses to domestic pressure groups. It came about in an administration preoccupied with domestic politics, the views of many of whose leading members were shaped by the protests of the early 1970s deprecating the role of power and seeking to replace it with \"New Age\" issues like the environment and humanitarianism. Ironically - and perhaps because of this ambivalence -- the Clinton Administration has found itself drawn to a more frequent use of military power than any other post-war administration. In the heyday of their pre-eminence, the Roman and British empires managed to transform their power into consensus and their governing principles into widely accepted norms. The United States has not yet achieved such a position. Its decisions shape international events to an unprecedented degree but they have often appeared, especially to non-Americans, as either arbitrary or random responses to domestic constituencies. One result has been to spur groupings of nations at least in part designed to reclaim a greater freedom for regional or national decisions. To some extent, this is an inevitable reaction to our dominant position. Yet, while regional groupings may turn out to be the building blocks of a new international order, it makes a great deal of difference whether they seek their identity in cooperation with America or in opposition to it. The problem goes beyond the biases of the Clinton Administration. A society that has never known a permanent threat has been tempted by the end of the cold war to impose its preferences unilaterally, without calculating the reactions of other peoples or the long-range costs of such a course. A vigorous and highly competitive media has compounded the tendency for foreign policy to become a subdivision of domestic politics. In part as a reaction to this unilateralism, the European Union has emerged from the successful Kosovo war with a determination to forge an independent defence capability, calls for an Asian bloc have multiplied, and even Mercosur in Latin America is veering toward a more confrontational rationale. A dominant power unable to define a general concept fails in its principal potential contribution to world order. Administration diplomacy has been most successful where the challenge was most comparable to domestic politics, as in the Arab-Israeli negotiations. It has not managed to integrate either Russia or China into a workable international order. And it has failed to develop a strategy for the two most fundamental issues of global order: how to deal with rogue states and how to translate our moral values into an operational diplomacy. Iraq has been a test case for America's policy toward rogue states. But we have been in retreat since December 1998. Then British and American planes attacked Iraqi military installations in retaliation to flagrant Iraqi violations of the UN inspections system, imposed by the Bush Administration as the price for permitting Saddam to extricate his army and his rule from defeat in the Gulf war of 1991. Coupled with tough sanctions, the inspections system was supposed to eliminate Saddam's ability to pose a military threat to Iraq's neighbours and to stability in the Gulf. The Clinton Administration codified this into a containment strategy designed, in the words of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to \"put Saddam in a box.\" Implemented in the style of the \"New Age\" diplomacy, it alternated the rhetoric of conciliation with ineffective spasms of military confrontation. For his part, Saddam moved tenaciously to wriggle out of international restraints. In 1996 he moved his army into the Kurdish autonomous zone heretofore, at least tacitly, under American protection. By 1998 he felt strong enough to challenge the UN inspections system frontally. Nevertheless, on Nov. 15, 1998, President Clinton still spoke of giving Saddam an opportunity \"to become honourably reconciled by simply observing UN resolutions.\" Predictably, Saddam accelerated the pursuit of the three objectives that have guided his policy: 1) to shift the world's attention away from Iraq's flouting of UN obligations and to the alleged harm being done by UN sanctions to Iraq's population; 2) to magnify and force into the open the latent disagreements among the permanent members of the Security Council over Iraq, and 3) to involve the Secretary General of the UN as a mediator, thereby placing Saddam's grievances on the same level as his adversaries. President Clinton reacted to Saddam's defiance by ordering airstrikes. But the Administration's ambivalence with respect to the use of power for strategic or political objectives turned that enterprise into a cover for abandoning the inspections system rather than for enforcing it. Unrelated to any specific political demand, such as the restoration of an adequate inspections system, the bombing lasted but three nights (there was no daylight bombing), earning us opprobrium without political benefit. Clearly, these events have left Saddam far closer to his objectives than the United States is to its own goals. The UN inspectors evicted by Saddam have not returned. And UN diplomacy has focused on the removal of sanctions, so that their end, supported by three of the five permanent members of the Security Council - Russia, France and China - or their emasculation seems only a question of time. As a result, the victory of the Gulf war is in danger of unravelling. None of the Gulf states believes in the possibility of reconciliation with Iraq. The Islamic Republic of Iran watches amid its own domestic debate over the relative merits of moderation and intransigence. When Tehran's hard-line leaders see how a defeated neighbour succeeds in defying a multilateral coalition ostensibly headed by the United States, their incentive for moderation will surely diminish. A political vacuum is emerging in which an ambivalent United States will be obliged - without significant allies - to defend the weak Gulf states against the two strongest states in the region - hardly an ideal example for deterring rogue states globally. The strategic and political paralysis in dealing with the rogue challenge in the Gulf has been overshadowed by the most dramatic use of NATO military power since World War II - the 78-day bombing campaign over Kosovo. Nothing could show more clearly the emotional priorities of the Clinton Administration than the fact that it devoted 78 days to destroying the infrastructure of Serbia, a country representing no strategic threat, and only three nights to overcoming Saddam's eviction of the UN inspections system, heretofore considered the key to stability in the vital Gulf. For weeks during and after the Kosovo crisis, both Washington and London trumpeted their humanitarian foreign policy as the progressive alternative to traditional diplomacy based on equilibrium. But life has been far more complicated. Multiethnicity in the Balkans has proved far more difficult than \"progressive\" exhortations to that effect.Nor has the Kosovo intervention solved the political problem that gave rise to it. NATO occupation of Kosovo is based on a UN resolution that explicitly describes Kosovo as an autonomous part of Yugoslavia (Article 5) and reaffirms the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all of Yugoslavia (Article 8). There is even a provision for a token number of Serb administrators. To underline the UN commitment to a multiethnic state, the KLA (the armed forces of the Albanian resistance) was supposed to be disarmed by NATO. None of these provisions has been implemented or has a prospect of being implemented. The KLA has not been truly disarmed; the opposite of a multiethnic society is coming into being; Yugoslav sovereignty can only be exercised at the price of a bloody Serb intervention. In the name of a humanitarian foreign policy, NATO has manoeuvred itself into a position where it is condemned either to the permanent occupation of Kosovo or to seeking to find a different UN rationale - a change Russia would probably veto - to permit the emergence of an independent Kosovo. But an independent Kosovo is precisely what all NATO states have sought to avoid. They have evaded their own principle of self-determination because they know that an independent Kosovo would evoke claims for a similar status for Albanians in Macedonia, adjoining Kosovo. Yet a break-up of Macedonia could unleash another Balkan war and lead to another NATO protectorate, continuing a process whereby either NATO becomes the heir of the old Turkish and Austrian empires or the Balkans continue in a state of permanent crisis. America and its allies were right in resisting Serbian ethnic cleansing. But their means were inappropriate to the objective. The NATO demand at Rambouillet for unlimited right to move its forces across Yugoslav territory and occupy a province of a sovereign country - before ethnic cleansing had started on a large scale - guaranteed the most bloody outcome. Not even a reasonable Yugoslav government could accept such terms. Less emphasis on domestic politics and more thoughtful understanding of history would have produced a better balance between the humanitarian and political challenges, saved more lives and created better conditions for a long-term political evolution. And it would have avoided the uneasiness caused in many parts of the world by NATO's drift from defensive to offensive missions. The same tendency to seek immediate solution to an historic problem has also exacerbated the situation in East Timor. The West pressed an interim unelected Indonesian government that had already granted full autonomy to East Timor to move toward independence - in the midst of Indonesia's first democratic election. This perversely reduced that government's ability to restrain its dissident military. And the lack of sensitivity to Indonesia's concern with the precarious unity of its state and of the religious issue involved has mortgaged not only the fledgling democracy but Indonesia's historic partnership with the West. Six months after the proclaimed triumph over Kosovo, the West's reaction to Russian repression of Chechnya showed that Kosovo had established far from a general principle. Russia, as Serbia, is trying to impose its rule on a dissident province; as in Kosovo, the conflict between the Orthodox Christianity of the rulers and the Islamic faith of the rebels is religious in origin; and, as in the Balkans, the rulers seek to break the will of their subjects by making their lives in their home province unendurable, generating mass migration. What differs is the reaction of the Western allies. The apostles of the so-called ethical policy can bring themselves to utter criticisms of Russia only in a shamefaced form designed to placate critics at home rather than affect decisions in Moscow. Both in official statements and in the media, the \"freedom fighters\" of Kosovo have been transmuted by tacit abdication into the \"rebels,\" or \"militants,\" of Chechnya. Moscow is criticized, if at all, for inflicting excessive casualties, not for the purpose of the operation - which, in fact, President Clinton endorsed as protecting the integrity of Russia's borders and fighting terrorism. The reluctance to jeopardize relations with a potentially powerful Russia is understandable. But just as, in Kosovo, the absence of historical perspective caused us to veer too far in the direction of moral crusades, we have now erred by adopting too narrow a definition of the national interest. Even granting that blocking Russian intervention was impossible, it nevertheless was important to discourage Russia from future attempts to rely on force in regulating its relations with its many neighbours - already fearful about being forced back into a new Russian empire. And this required a less timid response. Moral precepts are absolute and make no allowance for historical evolution. When thwarted, they allow no fall-back. But foreign policy must deal with nuances and processes rather than terminal points. Public relations myths - or worse, self-delusion - cannot serve as a substitute. New Age diplomacy has not abolished the need to strike a balance between a society's ideals and the necessities of its place in the world. Oscillation between over-commitment and abdication will vitiate our power and our capacity to shape a stable international order.

{"title": "Independence Cup notebook", "body": "NO COMMENT NOW Record breaking batsman and former India captain Sunil Gavaskar arrived in the city on Saturday to witness the ongoing Coca-Cola Independence Cup as one of Bangladesh Cricket Board's special guests. First man to reach 10,000-run mark and the scorer of most centuries in Test cricket , the legendary opening batsman however will not be a mere guest and perform another role during his stay. Recently in the centre of controversy for his remark about present Indian captain Azharuddin, 'Sunny' as he is known in the cricketing fraternity, refused to make any comment on Azhar's superlative batting effort yesterday saying he is under a contract with a vernacular daily to write a column regularly through the Independence Cup. It was during the 23rd over of the Pakistan innings when this reporter came across this batting colossus near the WorldTel commentary box. When asked about the match Gavaskar who apparently was not at first aware of the questioner's journalistic connection reacted quickly, \" Good match. I think it is going to be a pretty close contest.\" What does he have to say about Azharuddin's century ? \" No comment now\" by now the maestro had found out the identity of the person he was talking to though rather curiously but the caution was obvious , \" No, I can not make any comment because I am under a contract. I will write that in my column.\" PAKISTAN CAPTAIN The newly appointed Pakistan captain Rashid Latif is likely to lead his country until the 1999 World Cup, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official revealed. Tariq Aziz, a Karachi-based Pakistan Cricket Board coordinator who is now covering the ongoing Coca-Cola Independence Cup as a commentator of Radio Pakistan , yesterday told The Daily Star that Rashid Latif enjoys the reputation of being the most honest and disciplined cricketer in Pakistan. \"There prevails a notion that Rashid only concentrates on cricket. The main consideration behind his appointment as the captain was his honesty and simplicity which are in short supply in Paskistan cricket these days,\" said Tariq . SHAME! An unknown girl in the gallery raised a placard during yesterday's match reading \"Shahid Afridi, please marry me\". This shameless exhibition of marital inclination caught the public eye when the TV camera dwelt on the ladies' gallery in the course of the live coverage of the India Pakistan match. State Minister for Information Abu Sayeed gave commentators of Bangladesh Television a piece of his mind yesterday. The otiose professor paid a surprise visit to the roof top box of the BTV 'bunglers'. The State minister was reportedly annoyed with the standard of commentary in course of the opening match of the Independence Cup between India and Bangladesh on Saturday. He instructed them not to 'air' things they were not properly informed of.

{"title": "Africa's nations renew rivalry", "body": "JOHANNESBURG, Feb 3: The African Nations' Cup comes of age this week in Burkina Faso with the 21st edition of the biennial 16-country showpiece, reports AFP. Apart from Olympic champions Nigeria, suspended for refusing to defend the title in South Africa, the giants are present, including World Cup qualifiers Cameroon, Mrocco, South Africa and Tunisia. Morocco are the popular choice to lift the trophy because they can field a settled side, employ an experienced coach in Frenchman Henri Michel, and have been ranked No 1 in Africa since last May. But the 41-year history of the competition is littered with upsets and the lions of the atlas could face formidable challenges from holders South Africa, Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Tunisia and Zambia. The four previous tournaments staged in west Africa were won by countries from the region and footballers used to first-class accommodation and facilities may struggle here. While the organisers have spared no effort to host a memorable 22-day event, Burkina Faso is one of the poorest nations in the world and cannot hope to match the glitz of South Africa two years ago. Ouagadougou, the capital city in the heart of the landlocked country, and the south-western town of Bobo-Dioulasso play host to teams from the north, west, centre and south of the continent. The Chinese-built, 40,000-seat August 4 Stadium stages the opening ceremony, they first game between Burkina Faso and Cameroon Saturday, and the final on February 28. Matches in Ouagadougou are divided between the National Stadium and the smaller Municipal Stadium while Bobo-Dioulasso boasts the new, French-built Omnisport Stadium. Crowds at games not involving Burkina Faso are expected to be much larger than in South Africa, where only fixtures featuring 'bafana bafana' (the boys) drew big attendances. Expectations are high that the finals could match those of 1984 in Ivory Coast, where the 'indomitable lions' of Cameroon won what is widely regarded to be the most exciting of the 20 tournaments. If the presence of stars guarantees success then Burkina Faso can hardly fail as veterans, established internationals and young hopefuls strive to capture the attention of spectators and a worldwide television audience. The 'old guard' includes Abedi Pele of Ghana, who collected a winners' medal in Libya 16 years ago, and fellow-midielder Kalusha Bwalya from Zambia, the strongest team never to have finished first. Noureddine Naybet of Morocco and Hani Ramzy of Egypt in defence, Moussa Saib of Algeria and Zoubeir Beya of Tunisia in midfield, and 'Paulao' of Angola and Patrick Mboma of Cameroon in attack are proven performers. No continent encourages youth more than Africa and much is expected of strikers Benni McCarthy of South Africa, 'Akwa' of Angola and Ibrahim Babayoko of Ivory Coast. Only Group B, where four-time champions Ghana and 1996 runners-up Tunisia should have the measure of the ill-prepared Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and limited Togo, appears clearcut. A dramatic improvement by Burkina Faso since the arrival of French coach Philippe Troussier could spell problems for Cameroon and Algeria in Group A with Guinea the outsiders. Ivory Coast borders Burkina Faso and the 1992 champions can expect huge support in Group C against South Africa, without a win in seven matches, potential giantkillers Angola and dark horses Namibia. Every tournament has a group of death and a pool containing Morocco, Zambia and Egypt certainly fits the bill with Mozambique completing the Group D line-up. Each team plays its three opponents once on a league system with three points for a win and one for a draw and group winners and runners-up advance to the quarterfinals.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/africas-nations-renew-rivalry", "date": "1998-02-04T00:00:56+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 598},

{"title": "Banks reject BFFEA proposal for cash incentives", "body": "The central bank and the commercial banks have rejected the frozen food industry's proposal for cash incentive and blanket transfer of 40 per cent of all its arrears into the \"blocked account,\" says UNB. To keep the frozen food export uninterrupted, the banks, however, have decided to give some \"special facilities\" temporarily only to those food-processing units which are still in production. At a recent meeting, chaired by Bangladesh Bank deputy governor Khondker Ibrahim Khalid, the bank executive also assured Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters' Association (BFFEA) of giving \"packing credit\" on the basis of \"case-to-case\" study of the status of individual unit. Frozen food export accounts for 10 per cent of the country's total export earnings and contributes 5 per cent to the GDP. The bankers endorsed the Association's concern about the staggering situation of the frozen food industry, hard hit by the abrupt fall of price in international market. But they categorically said the proposal for giving any cash financial assistance on export was beyond their jurisdiction and felt that the government might take necessary steps regarding the issue. Fall of price, import restriction by the EU, currency devaluation by the competing exporter countries have altogether made the Bangladesh's frozen food export very tough and competitive, resulting in huge stockpile of frozen food and shortage of fund for loan repayment. Failure in repaying overdue loans led many exporters to face fund shortage as they are not getting fresh loans, thus leading to closure of many food processing units and stoppage of export from many others, the meeting observed. The units, which exported frozen foods in last few months, and have export orders in had will be fit to be chosen for special consideration. But no defaulted unit will get any consideration. Fifteen per cent of the real stock price of the chosen frozen food exporters may be kept as \"blocked account\" for three years. Concerned banks will realise the amount directly from export bills within the stipulated timeframe. As an alternative, packing credit may be granted but a unit cannot avail of both the opportunities at a time. The frozen food exporters and processors will have to pay 9 per cent interest on blocked account while the banker-customer relationship will decide about the guarantee. Earlier, Bangladesh Frozen Food Exporters Association (BFFEA) president Golam Mostafa made two proposals to help the frozen food industry recover from the present crisis, caused by factors beyond its control The two proposals were: Transferring 40 per cent of the actual loan into interest-free blocked account and realising it at 1 per cent rate on export bills after a three-year moratorium; and giging 15 per cent alternative partial cash incentive. Golam Mostafa gave the meeting a detailed picture how crisis engulfed the frozen food industry, despite its bright prospects. Prices of frozen shrimp dropped by 40 per cent in international market during July 1997 to December 1998 period, he said, leading many exporters to lose their running capital. Besides, the EU clamped a ban on export of frozen food from Bangladesh in July 1997 on the plea of quality control, compelling many processing units to invest Tk 1.5 crore to 2 crore for overhauling and to suspend production for seven to eight months. As a result, the industry developed a huge backlog of frozen food and was forced to sell those below the usual rate. The 1998 flood gave another blow to the industry, inundating many shrimp plants. On the other hand, several frozen foodexporting countries, including India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Pakistan, devalued their currency against the dollar to boost their exports. Country's export target of frozen food during the current fiscal year has been fixed at Tk 1500 crore, which is Tk 217 crore higher then the export in 1995-96. Some 1.2 million people are directly involved with the industry while another 12 million indirectly. If a proper policy is adopted and implemented, the frozen food export can be raised to 1.5 billion US dollar in four years, Golam Mostafa hoped.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/banks-reject-bffea-proposal-for-cash-incentives", "date": "1999-01-17T00:00:33+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 668},

Such was the impact of the Pujara-Vijay effort that India managed to cross the 500-run mark despite losing their last nine wickets for only 116 runs.

{"title": "Glimmers of hope for troubled US newspapers", "body": "A news vendor is seen at Manhattan's Cooper Square, New York City. The US newspaper industry sees some positive signs after being battered for years. Photo: AFP The US newspaper industry is seeing some glimmers of hope after being battered for years, a prominent study concluded Monday. While the industry is about half the size it once was, there are some positive signs, including new revenue streams from digital paywalls and a general economic improvement which is aiding newspapers, the study found. \"For the first time since the deep recession that began in 2007, newspaper organizations have grounds for a modicum of optimism,\" said the authors of the study by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism. The 2013 State of the News Media report said newspapers \"have started to experiment in a big way with a variety of new revenue streams and major organizational changes.\" Some of these, such as using social media to help advertisers, are too new to be measured, but are part of a trend which suggests stabilizing revenue, the researchers said. Among other positive signs, the report said: - Digital pay plans have been adopted at 450 of the 1,380 dailies US and \"appear to be working not just at The New York Times but also at small and mid-sized papers.\" These are helping add new revenues and reduce dependence on advertising. - Publicly traded newspaper companies saw their share prices rise in 2012, albeit from a reduced base, with several up 30 percent or more. - Newspapers coming onto the market are finding buyers. Among the notable investors are Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway bought a group of 63 newspapers and several others. - The modest improvement in the economy has eased pressures on the industry, with auto advertising reviving and real estate and employment ads recovering in some markets as well. Nonetheless, the authors say these positives \"are, for the time being, mostly promise rather than performance\" and that the basic indicators remain grim. Print advertising fell for a sixth consecutive year in 2012 -- by a significant 7.3 percent or $1.5 billion. National advertising is especially weak, suggesting that corporations are shifting to other platforms. The Pew research shows digital advertising now represents 15 percent of total newspaper ad revenue, but has grown anemically the past two years and does not come close to covering print ad losses. The study indicates newsrooms are still being slashed and that readership from mobile platforms is failing to generate significant revenues. \"Though the great majority of newspaper organizations are profitable on an operating basis, many companies continue to struggle with debt and pension obligations assumed in better times,\" the report said. \"In a symbolic indicator of decline, newspapers are abandoning the grand headquarters buildings that used to help anchor downtowns in favor of smaller, less expensive offices. Those that stay are starting to rent excess space to other businesses.\" Some dailies have cut print frequency to three times a week, which has sparked a heated debate in the industry. The most prominent of these was the New Orleans Times-Picayune and its parent Advance Publications. In Pew interviews with executives at 13 major newspaper companies, the most common prediction was that more papers would soon adopt the three-day-a-week publication schedule. The report said newspapers continue to slash staff, making it harder to cover news in the way readers have expected. \"This adds up to a news industry that is more undermanned and unprepared to uncover stories, dig deep into emerging ones or to question information put into its hands,\" the report said. And a public opinion survey released in the report showed that 31 percent had \"deserted a news outlet because it no longer provides the news and information they had grown accustomed to,\" Pew said. Overall, Pew said media organizations -- including newspapers, broadcasters and cable news operators -- were shrinking further, driving consumers to seek information elsewhere. \"There are all sorts of contributors in the evolving landscape of news and, in many ways, more opportunities for citizens to access information,\" said Amy Mitchell, acting director of the Pew Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism. \"But there are more signs than ever that the reduced reporting power in the news industry is having an effect and may weaken both the industry's capacity to produce in-depth journalism and its credibility with the public at the same time that others are gaining more voice.\" Pew said that Google has become a dominant force in digital news, impacting traditional media groups. \"News organizations are increasingly dependent on Google and a handful of other powerful tech firms for the tools and platforms needed to reach their audience,\" the Pew report said. \"They also are increasingly vulnerable to the changes the tech firms are introducing. The shift to mobile, for example, is making news an ever-more expensive arena in which to operate, but it is not yet producing the kind of new revenues to back up news organizations that will allow them to support those expenses.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/glimmers-of-hope-for-troubled-us-newspapers", "date": "2013-03-19T00:15:57+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 838},

Held at the Osmani Memorial Hall under the auspices of the education ministry, the function was also addressed by State Minister for Education ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Deputy Minister Mohammad Abdus Salam Pinto as special guests. Presided over by Education Secretary Mohammad Shahidul Alam, the inaugural function was also addressed, among others, by Director General of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Directorate Abdur Rashid and Joint Secretary of the ministry Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. Dr. Osman Farruk said the education administration had become weak and full of irregularities and the managing committees almost \"non-functioning\" because of \"personal\" and \"coterie\" interests. \"Our government does not believe in politicisation of school and college managing committees,\" he said adding that to improve the prevailing situation, both responsibility and accountability of the governing bodies had to be enhanced. The education minister said the responsibility to improve the standard of education must be carried out jointly by its stakeholders -- teachers, students, guardians, civil society members and the government. The education minister said the curriculum as well as syllabus of the text books must be \"life-oriented\" and realistic so that real nation-building architects come out from the country's 107,000 educational institutions. The main work to attain this goal has to be carried out by 750,000 teachers employed in these institutions, he said. Turning to the quality education, the minister said \"We do not want to engage police to remove note books from the market, nor do we want to close down the private coaching centres right now.\" \"We have to go to the root of the problem and ask ourselves why students have become dependent on note books and coaching centres,\" he said, adding that teachers must perform their sacred jobs of imparting education and wisdom to their pupils in the class room for the full period of their contract hours before heading for coaching centres. \"We have to recast our education system so that the new generation can be injected with human and moral values and are well-educated,\" he said. He stressed the need for introducing an education system that is capable of achieving the basic objectives of education, like enlightening the learners, making them wise, knowledgeable and good citizens and capable of innovating new skills and strategies for nation-building purposes. Making a departure from his written speech, the education minister raised some important issues like adopting unfair means in examinations, misuse of funds and facilities, sufferings of the teachers in the corridors of education directorate and national university to get their problems addressed. At the same time, the minister hinted at some important measures his ministry is going to take to streamline this very important sector of national life. He said the education directorate and the national university would be further decentralised so that the teachers and others concerned could get their services without undergoing much hazard and inconvenience.

{"title": "Agri Credit and Fate of Cultivator", "body": "The objective of establishing Agriculture Bank in the country is to assist the cultivators and boost agricultural production. From the then Pakistani period up till now huge amount of money has been disbursed among the cultivators and the credit programme is still running in the country. The agriculture credit is essential to help the farmers during or after damage of crops by natural calamities like flood, drought etc. There are different types of credit being disbursed among the farmers like short term, medium term, long term, crop loan, fishery loan, loan for purchasing agricultural tools, machinery, inputs etc. All types of small, medium and large farmers are entitled to take loan from the bank after fulfilling the necessary formalities. Sometimes, taking loan from the banks becomes difficult. The uneducated farmers are cheated by some corrupt bank officials and middlemen who take illegal gratification from the farmers. As a result the farmers are compelled to go to the private money lenders bracing exorbitant interest. Monitoring: Is there any monitoring or follow up system on the utilisation of the credit taken for a specific purpose? Nothing effective. In many cases it has been observed that the farmers do not use the credit in productive purposes rather they use the money in social purposes like, payment of dowry or to meet up the expenses of son's/daughter's marriage or sometimes even in household consumption. If the loan is not used for productive purposes it may be really difficult to repay it in time. Repayment: The repayment of agricultural loan is mainly dependent on the production of crops. If the farmers do not have a good harvest, normally they are not interested or in a position to pay back the money. Even they do not walk near the bank and try to evade meeting the bank personnel. Due to non-payment of loan in time, the amount becomes bigger by addition of interest in compound rate. In the process, after some years, it becomes really difficult to repay the loan by the poor farmers. Moreover, in rural Bangladesh there prevails a belief government may rebate all the loans some day considering the borrower's incapability. Due to wait-and-see perception of the farmers and increase of loan amount with addition of compound interest, the farmers become eventually discouraged to repay. But on the other hand, loan taken from private source can not be kept unpaid for long time due to pressure from the lenders and in fear of losing property as well as social status in society. Repayment is made or has to be made quickly. The realisation rate in private sector is always higher than in public sector. Dealing with Defaulters: According to reports in the daily newspapers, \"banks are hostage to 87 defaulters\" in the country. These defaulters are very rich. They have borrowed heavily from the banks and just did not pay back the money. Whereas in the rural areas, many certificate cases have been filed against the farmers for non-payment of bank loans. The poor farmers are willing to repay but they do not have any capacity to pay back the amount. It may be mentioned that in rural areas of the country many farmers have taken crop loan, fishery loan some 15-20 years back, but are yet to repay those. Several notices have been given from the banks but the collection rate is not satisfactory and the progress that has been made through recovery system is not always socially encouraging. It may be mentioned that some of the bank-mortgaged lands have been sold out and the previous owners of those land have either migrated to the city or to other countries. Considering the number of defaulters and amount of outstanding credit, there must be a huge number of mortgaged plots in the whole country. To whom these will be sold or how, or will it be a wise decision? How to solve this problem? This is a vital question of the social/political leaders and reputed economists of the country. Moreover, what action will be taken in case of those famous 87 defaulters who do not have any intention to repay the bank loans? Are they out of the law of the land? Do they provide special privilege to the government or do they have two votes per person? The citizens of the Republic want to see every citizen is treated equally in the eye of law of the land and dealt with accordingly. To deal with the defaulter farmers it may be suggested that the interest of all outstanding agricultural loans up to Tk 10,000.00 per farmer should be rebated fully and only the capital amount realised in instalments, by which, both the farms and farmers will be saved. In near future interest-free agricultural credit programme should be initiated experimentally with the sanction of Tk 15,000.00 to each interested farmer. Only service charge at the rate of 3 per cent to 5 per cent on the capital amount can be charged. Through this programme, the marginal and medium class farmers are expected to benefit largely.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/agri-credit-and-fate-of-cultivator", "date": "1999-01-11T00:00:50+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 842},

{"title": "Oil dips as hopes for output cutback extension dwindles", "body": "LONDON, Jan 29: Oil prices fell back this week amid profit-taking of recent sharp gains, as hopes dwindled of an extension to producer output cutbacks, says AFP. The Brent North Sea reference crude fell to 25.70 dollars a barrel for March delivery on the International Petroleum Exchange in London from 26.76 dollars last week for February. On the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), light sweet crude for February delivery fell to 27.62 dollars from 29.66 dollars last week. Prices peaked at new nine-year high points early in the week as a US cold snap increased demand, eating into already low stock levels. But prices fell after Norway and Saudi Arabia both said that crucial output cutbacks should remain in place until the end of March as planned, but said nothing about an extension to the cuts. A pact last March to rein in global supply by 2.1 million barrels a day, including 1.7 million from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Counties, helped oil prices more than double, but now the market is looking for indications of what will happen once the agreement expires in March. OPEC will take a final decision on the production quotas in Vienna in March. Rubber: Bounce. Rubber prices gained ground this week in a calm market. The arrival of winter in some Asian producer regions could limit supply, helping prices in coming weeks, one London dealer said. The London rubber index jumped to 482 pounds per tonne (for February delivery) from 455 last week. Meanwhile, in Kuala Lumpur, the RSS1 index rose to 2.64 ringgit per kilo from 2.46 ringgit, while the SMR20 index for material used in tire-manufacturing rose to 2.85 ringgit from 2.74. Tea: Weak. Demand fell away in the Mombasa auction houses but picked up in Colombo.

{"title": "Rony was drunk while shooting", "body": "A counsel for Bakhtiar Alam Rony, son of ruling Awami League lawmaker Pinu Khan, yesterday told a Dhaka court that his client was drunk when he shot dead two people in the capital on April 14. His client had no intention to kill any people, claimed advocate Kazi Nazibullah Hiru, adding that Rony committed the offence when he was drunk. So, he should not be placed on remand. Moreover, his client is sick, and he should be given proper treatment in jail custody. The lawyer said this while moving a petition seeking bail and cancellation of the seven-day fresh remand prayer by detectives. But the prosecution opposed it, saying Rony committed the offence with his full knowledge because he knew that if he shot a man, he would be killed. So, the accused should be remanded. Rejecting defence pleas, Metropolitan Magistrate Mahbubur Rahman put Rony on a four-day fresh remand for gleaning more information about the double murder in the city's New Eskaton. The jail authorities yesterday produced Rony before the court. In the remand prayer, Dipak Kumar Das, a sub-inspector of Detective Branch (DB) of police and also the investigating officer of the case, said he had earlier quizzed Rony intensively for four days and got vital clues about the killings. On June 13, Rony was sent to jail on expiry of his remand. But Rony, the prime accused in the double murder, was trying to conceal information vital to the investigation, Dipak said in the petition submitted on June 21. His driver and three friends had given statements before magistrates where they said Rony had killed the two people with his licenced pistol. So, he needed to be remanded again to find more information about the killings, the petition said. The three friends of Rony and his driver in their statements before metropolitan magistrates said Bakhtiar lowered the window of his sport-utility vehicle (SUV) after it got stuck in a traffic jam in New Eskaton and fired four to five shots around 1:30am, hitting rickshaw-puller Abdul Hakim and CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver Yakub Ali.

{"title": "Hingis' missed chance!", "body": "MELBOURNE, Jan 24: World number one Martina Hingis said today that she was disappointed her rival Serena Williams failed to make it past the fourth round of the Australian open because she wanted to knock her out herself, reports Reuters. Speaking after she bundled French hope Sandrine Testud out of the Australian Open 6-1, 7-6, the confident Swiss teenager said she had been looking forward to renewing her rivalry with Williams, who beat her in last year's US Open final. They were due to meet in the semifinals at Melbourne Park but their reunion was put on hold after Williams crashed out to Russia's Elena Likhovtseva. \"I thought I would have a good chance to beat her right here right now, especially because it has been my tournament for the last three years,\" Hingis said. \"She's one of the top players out there, you always want to compete against.\" Hingis was in determined mood against the French 12th seed Testud on Monday, winning her match in 72 minutes to keep alive her hopes of winning the women's singles and doubles titles at Melbourne for the fourth time. She broke Testud's serve twice in the opening set and calmly fought back from a 3-0 deficit in the second to force a tiebreak, which she won 7-3. \"It's been long days for me at the office,\" she said. \"But you have to be ready every single time you go out there.\" Her quarterfinal opponent will be Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, who beat Austrian Barbara Schett earlier on Monday. If she wins, she will play either Likhovtseva or Spaniard Conchita Martinez. With Williams out of the way, Hingis unsurprisingly nominated second seed Lindsay Davenport as the hardest to beat and said she hoped to play her in the final. Although they have been ranked number one and two for most of the past three years, Hingis and Davenport have only played each other once in a Grand Slam final.

{"title": "4 lakh drug addicts detected in 8 N-dists", "body": "PABNA, July 25: Number of drug addicts in eight northern districts of the country have been increasing day by day and a huge quantity of various narcotics are being smuggled through different border points everyday, reports UNB. According to a survey conducted by a non-government organisation, about four lakh people of Nilphamari, Rangpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon and Panchagarh districts have been consuming drugs regularly. Majority of them are college students and unemployed youths while the others are rickshaw-pullers, small traders, smugglers, floating people and frustrated lovers. Due to easy availability of the drugs including wine, phensidyl, ganja, heroin, opium in abundance more and more youths are getting addicted everyday. The drugs worth about crores of taka are being smuggled into the country through Burimari and Mugulhat in Lalmonirhat, Chilhati in Nilphamari, Nanglabandha in Panchagarh and Hilly in Dinajpur districts. About 1.5 lakh men and women in the bordering districts are engaged in smuggling of the drugs with Saidpur in Nilphamari district as the main centre for distribution to the interior, the survey revealed. A source of the Narcotics Control Department said manpower shortage was responsible for their inability to successfully curb the illegal drug trade and abuse. The sources said in five districts under the Rangpur zone of the department 27 posts of Deputy Director, Inspector and sepoy have been vacant for long. The drugs are available in most of the medicine shops in these districts and the owners of the shops are making money. According to the report, out of total 4,700 medicine shops in these districts, 3,500 shops are running their business without licence. Meanwhile, there is a counselling committees headed by Deputy Commissioner (DC), at district level for creating public awareness and taking action against the drug addicts. Decisions for enforcing different measures to control the menace are being taken at the committee meeting each month. But in practice the menace is on rise, the report said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/4-lakh-drug-addicts-detected-in-8-n-dists", "date": "1997-07-26T00:00:28+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 322},
{"title": "All the President's Women...", "body": "Here is what happened. The accusers: To establish a pattern of Presidential sexual harassment, the Paula Jones sexual harassment case prosecution subpoenaed a deposition under oath from a former White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. In the deposition, Ms. Lewinsky, who is no longer an intern, testified that she had had no sexual relationship with the President. The betrayer, and the devil: How did the Paula Jones' attorneys find out about Lewinsky? Courtesy Linda Tripp, a Bush White House employee, a hold out at the Clinton White House until 1994, who intensely disliked President Clinton. Tripp befriended Monica Lewinsky. Tripp's friend, \"literary agent\" slimy Lucianne Goldberg, whose hatred for Clinton exceeded Tripp's, came up with a devious scheme. Goldberg told Tripp: \"Encourage Monica to divulge her relationship with Clinton over the phone and record it secretly. This could result in a best selling book!\" Intensely partial \"independent\" Council: Instead of writing the best seller, Tripp took the tapes of twenty hours of conversation with the unsuspecting Monica, in which she bragged of sexual relationship with Clinton, to the staunch Republican Kenneth Starr, the \"independent\" council, appointed by his Republican cronies to investigate the Democratic President. Starr was appointed to investigate the President's \"shady\" Whitewater land deal in Arkansas four years ago. Finding no Presidential wrong doing there, he expanded his investigations to include the White House travel office mismanagement, the suicide of the President's friend Vince Foster in 1993, and now Clinton's sexual life. Sexual relationship with a consenting adult is not a crime in the USA; although it is not good for domestic tranquillity. What Starr is attempting to do is to grant Monica Lewinsky immunity from prosecution, in exchange of her changing her sworn deposition, and testifying that the President and his friend Vernon Jordan asked her to lie about the relationship. If Starr can prove that, then he can indict the President for obstruction of justice, and attempt to have him removed from the Presidency via impeachment or resignation. That would be the crowning achievement for the Republican partisan Starr, who could then justify spending over 30 million of the tax payers' money and having the government agencies such as the FBI under his disposal for four years. The American public: Those who dislike Clinton reacted the quickest. Clinton has been receiving letters that began, \"Listen, lover boy...\" However, in the aftermath of all this, Clinton's approval rating remains virtually unchanged around 60 per cent. Seventy-one per cent of the Americans believe that he should remain President, even if he had a sexual relationship with the now 24-year old Lewinsky. However, if it is established that the President asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie about their relationship, then a majority of the Americans would want him to leave office. Majority of the Americans also believe that Starr is partisan, and out to get the President! Luckily for Clinton, the country cares much more about Dow Jones (the economy is doing great) than Paula Jones or Monica Lewinsky. The President's character: Granted, the American people elected Bill Clinton the President, not the Pope. They were aware of his 12-year affair with a woman named Gennifer Flowers. (Tapes of their phone conversation have been made available to the public by the Republicans.) Half the Americans do believe that he propositioned Paula Jones in an Arkansas hotel in 1991. But all of these episodes took place before Bill Clinton became President Clinton. What is difficult to understand is how such an intelligent man, leading the country at a time of unprecedented prosperity and peace, could \"risk it all on a dalliance with a White House intern.\" Clinton is hardly the first politician or man with a testosterone problem. Nevertheless, one had the right to expect that he would postpone his dalliances until after he left the White House. Hiding behind semantics - that the relationship with Lewinsky was an \"emotional\" relationship, a \"special\" relationship, a \"not improper\" relationship, or a some sort of \"back room clothes-on\" relationship - will not help him. The fact is that the President let a lot of people down who believed in him. In 1963, as a brilliant High School student from Arkansas, Bill Clinton got to come to Washington and meet his idol, President Kennedy. He did not have to emulate Kennedy to the letter! Hillary Clinton: She went on national television and vigorously defended her husband. She accused Starr of spearheading a right-wing plot to get her husband, and to annul the result of two Presidential elections. She may have a point. Paula Jones is financed by the Republicans. Kenneth Starr is a lifelong Republican, appointed by the Republicans to investigate the President, had opposed Clinton's policies on behalf of clients such as the tobacco lobby and is a close friend of Clinton-haters, Republican right-wing Senator Jesse Helms, and Moral Majority Leader Jerry Falwell. Monica Lewinsky: In her senior year in high school Monica Lewinsky was voted \"most likely to have name in the lights.\" People who know her say that she has a tendency to exaggerate and fabricate. She is easily star-struck. The Republicans: Pretending to take the moral high road now, the Republicans are jumping with joy. This is one battle they believe they cannot lose. There is a saying that given money and time, anyone can be prosecuted. They have empowered Kenneth Starr with unlimited power and money. And the best news for the Republicans is that the Democrats cannot get back at them. The \"special prosecutor\" statue, enacted after Nixon's Watergate, comes up for renewal next year. Not a single legislator will vote for the renewal! Innuendo: Ms. Lewinsky is Jewish. The story broke on Tuesday, January 20, just as the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was about to meet with President Clinton. Palestinians say that the affair was deliberately leaked at that precise moment so that President Clinton could be prevented from pressuring Mr. Netanyahu. Militant Jewish settlers in the West Bank say that it was divine intervention through Lewinsky that saved Netanyahu and Israel. The Europeans: Several European leaders are under tremendous economic pressure. The Europeans mock America's fake puritanical streak. What they find more incredulous is that the inflation and unemployment is the lowest in America in decades, the economy is the strongest in the world, and yet the Americans want to throw out the leader who presided over this enormous success, only because a young woman threw herself at him! Jokes: Comedians are having a field day. Some samplings: \"Want to know why Al Gore is not visible these days? He is working on his inauguration speech.\" \"All the previous Presidents are known as ex-President. Bill Clinton will be known as Sex President!\" \"American public is willing to forgive Bill Clinton as long as he sees a therapist - a male therapist!\" Prognosis: The \"Comeback kid\" will survive. Unless Starr can prove that he lied and asked Monica Lewinsky to lie. Clinton's 75-minute State of the Union speech on January 27 was his best ever. It was interrupted 40 times by bipartisan standing ovation. Watching him deliver his speech, it was hard to imagine that he was in any kind of trouble. President Clinton will have to lick his wounds for a while, but the prognosis for a complete recovery is good.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/all-the-presidents-women", "date": "1998-02-03T00:00:10+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1216},

{"title": "Are the Fundamentals too Difficult to Comprehended?", "body": "George Bernard Shaw had asserted in the Preface to his play Arms and the Man that \"I am no believer in the worth of any mere taste for art that can not produce what it professes to appreciate.\" In the backdrop of continuous assertions that \"terrorists have no party' or that 'everything is being done according to law' (in reference to certain murder trials); and so forth, it seems that our rulers are fond of taking stances contrary to what GB Shaw had posited. The rulers are clearly fond of constantly talking about something, i.e., the rule of law, which they can hardly understand, let alone produce. They do seem to have a taste for the rule of law but this taste is not sustained by worthwhile efforts for it's realisation. Hence, the taste is worthless. Or so it would seem to GB Shaw, were he familiar with such pretensions. The primary onus for creating a society based on the rule of law is clearly with those in whom we have entrusted the executive powers of the state. Hence some reference to the highest executive authority is not uncalled for. The Daily Star's huge front page picture of a few days ago showing the prime minister's motorcade going through the wrong side of the road has been widely noticed. The prime minister's office hasn't issued any clarification or explanation; for example, whether such a recourse to the wrong side of the road was justified under the Special Security Force Ordinance, 1986 or any other legal dispensation. Lets assume that driving on the wrong side of the road was legally justified (as the rulers may have written a lot of privileges for themselves of which we citizens are not always informed) - fine. If not, has the prime minister taken any action against those who were responsible for violations of laws by her motorcade? Since there hasn't been any clarification or explanation, shall we assume that the PM's office hasn't found any justification or they have not simply bothered. In many a country such a violation would have, at least, diminished the moral authority of the chief executive to rule the country, since in those countries it is axiomatic that the chief executive governs according to the rule of law. Another ready example of glossing over the core premises of the rule of law would be the prime minister's suggestion, not so long ago in the parliament, that terrorists be 'shot at sight'. That no such thing can ever be done is very clear as the Constitution provides in Article 33 (3) that \"Every person accused of a criminal offence shall have the right to a speedy and public trial by an independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law.\" When you authorise police to shoot at sight, you turn the police into both the prosecutor and the judge. I wonder whether any one can think of an example as derogative of the rule of law as collapsing the prosecutor and the judge into one person. Long long time ago, back in the zamindari days, a zamindar used to accuse, determine the guilt, prescribe and inflict the punishment, all by himself. In our present terminology, a zamindar was the prosecutor, the judge and the jailor - all in one. The rule of law, however, is premised upon a complete separation of these three functions as well as the mandatory provision for defence against any accusation (Art. 33 of the Constitution states - \"..... nor shall he be denied the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice\"). If you go back to the zamindari days of collapsing all into one, you inevitably end up with Rubel kind of situation where police both accused Rubel of committing crimes and also meted out the punishment (brutal killing). Are these premises so difficult to understand? Then there was the widely reported recent statement implying that it may depend on the decision of the prime minister whether the leader of the Jatiya Party would again end up in jail or not. A large number of advocates have already protested that statement. The central premise of the rule of law that law takes it's own course, irrespective of the wishes of the executive, is probably beyond the realm of understanding of the chief executive. What is more disturbing is that all prosecutions against the leader of the Jatiya Party seem to be at a standstill. He is on bail, pending final determination of his appeals against the numerous convictions. The only explanation for this, one may hazard to venture, is that the office of the Attorney General may be under instruction from the government to 'go slow'. The prime minister's pronouncements can not but lead to such an assumption. Just a few months ago a lot was made in a BTV programme about the pardoning of the convicted killer of AL leader of Savar, Mr Moizuddin, by the then CMLA General Ershad and the fact that the convicted killer joined General Ershad's bandwagon with a lot of fun fare not far from the killing ground. The saddest part of all these is that we the citizens will continue to suffer because the rulers will not, if it suits them, allow the law to take it's own course. If one were to expand such examples, one must also include the prime minister's recent inauguration of one type of special courts in Dhaka. The rule of law also includes simple proposition that one organ of the state is separate from the other. How would the prime minister feel if the Chief Justice were to occasionally preside over the cabinet meetings or how about the Speaker sitting in as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court? If these are not acceptable then why did she had to inaugurate a court which, constitutionally, is under the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice (will reading articles 114 to 116 of the Constitution - I have counted, four short sentences in all - be too much to ask for?). The above, I must concede, are rather pedantic examples. Nevertheless, these have to be mentioned from the simple supposition that if one doesn't understand such simple fundamentals of the rule of law, it may not be wise, nay pointless, to write or elaborate on more serious aspects of the rule of law. Will it be too much to ask of our leaders to read at least Article 7 of the Constitution and hope that they understand it? \"All powers in the republic belong to the people....\" Power does not belong to the executive. The executive only exercises those powers which the people have permitted them to exercise, within the limits laid down in the Constitution. One more digression into Shaw. He was baptised in the faith of England (he was an Irish) and he grew up believing that \"God was a Protestant and that Roman Catholics went to hell.\" Will it be too wrong to suggest that the central premise of our politics is strongly influenced by such visions of right and wrong; hell and heaven. I and my party are Protestants and the rest will go to hell. Hartals are good examples of such stark black and white perceptions. The Constitution states that all citizens have the right to freedom of movement (Art. 36), freedom of profession or occupation (Art. 40) and right to property (Art. 42). A citizen can not be deprived of these fundamental rights. There is, however, one exception - Proclamation of Emergency. During the time when the Proclamation of Emergency is in force, these above rights, along with some others, can be suspended. Now we are threatened with a series of hartals in the coming weeks. Hartal virtually means suspenson of these rights. A citizen is denied his right to movement, can not exercise his profession or occupation and his right to property is at peril if he defies the orders issued by the hartal authorities. All these, therefore, virtually amount to a Proclamation of Emergency with the difference that the Proclamation is made not by the President but by the hartaling political parties. Thus, the fundamentals of the rule of law that no one can exercise power beyond what is authorised by the constitution is cast aside. A virtual proclamation of emergency is made to, ostensibly, facilitate the rule of law (for proper election, voting or whatever) by totalling losing sight of the fundamentals of the rule of law. Again, I can not but infer that it is very difficult for such persons to comprehend the very fundamentals of the rule of law. The hartalwallas will graciously exempt, for example, ambulances, journalists, pharmacies, hospitals and some others from the ambit of hartals. In other words, freedoms of movement, profession or property of some selected persons or bodies are most kindly recognised. Do they understand that it is not for them to determine which of my freedoms or rights I can exercise and which I can not. If they did, surely we would be living in a different country where 70% of the under-five children are not malnourished and, consequently, whose physical and mental growth are stunted for the rest of their lives (no amount of voting or political rights will ever enable these children to regain their lost health and intelligence and grow up to their full human potentials); where everyone at least the three square meals a day; and where the government makes at least half-decent efforts to provide education, health and employment for the citizens, irrespective of their political opinions. In the meantime all we, the citizens of this country, can hope that some day they will grow up and begin to comprehend the fundamentals of the rule of law and then, may be, we shall have better days. And until then we don't have much of an option but to continue to listen to their sermons about law, order, morality, development, bridges and culverts, and what not.

{"title": "Akhtar's action illegal", "body": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has banned Pakistan express bowler Shoaib Akhtar from international cricket over his bowling action, a Pakistani board official said Friday, reports AFP. The decision immediately rules Akhtar out of a tri-nation series involving Pakistan, Australia and India, starting in Australia on January 9. \"We have been informed by the ICC about this unfortunate decision. We have been asked to work on Shoaib's action,\" Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) secretary Shafqat Rana told. \"We have not been given any time frame,\" Rana said, adding he hoped the \"Rawalpindi Express\" would be available to play Sri Lanka in February. The ICC is to reconsider Akhtar's case in a month. A nine-member ICC committee outlawed Akhtar after an hour-long teleconference on Thursday. Waqar Younis would replace Akhtar in Australia and would depart in a couple of days senior PCB official Rameez Raja said. Raja, who heads PCB's advisory board, told the Associated Press of Pakistan that Younis had apologised for recent objectionable utterances. Younis was dropped from the squad for the second leg of Pakistan's recent Australian tour as according to selectors he was out of form. Pakistan subsequently lost the Test series 3-0. His omission led to outbursts from the bowler, who blamed skipper Wasim Akram. The decision on Akhtar was communicated to Pakistan team manager Brigadier Mohammad Nasir in Australia just hours after the side returned there for the tri-nation series. Last month they suffered an inglorious 3-0 Test series defeat in Australia. \"It is a big blow for the team and cricket. He is great attraction for cricket fans all over the world. We never found anything foul in his action,\" Rana said. During the October-November Test series, questions were raised by Australian umpires about the legitimacy of Akhtar's action. Officials said selectors would hold a meeting to decide for the replacement of Akhtar who is expected to return home from Australia. \"When the whole world was waiting for a Bret Lee-Akhtar clash for 100-mile thunderbolts this decision has ruined all,\" Rana said. \"It's a very harsh decision,\" former Pakistan captain and chief coordinator of PCB newly oppointed advisory council Rameez Raja said. Rameez was in the panel of experts who watched the footage of Akhtar's bowling sent by the ICC. \"His action when he bowls a bouncer is a little different but ICC had objected on one ball and has now banned him on his entire bowling,\" Rameez said. Rameez, however, ruled out any official protest to the ICC, saying: \"We do not want a head-on with ICC but we condemn the decision in a way that its on his entire bowling.\" Former captain and a member of advisory council Javed Miandad called upon the ICC to look into the law of illegal delivery. \"Its time now that ICC should change this law. Do all the bowlers with bend arm chuck, its unfair,\" said Miandad. Former chief selector Hasib Ehsan criticised New Zealander umpire John Reid. \"Its more of a personal decision and an attempt to run down the career of a popular cricketer.\" The issue cropped up when the bowling action of the 24-year-old fast bowler, dubbed as Rawalpindi Express, was questioned by international match referee John Reid of New Zealand after the test series against Australia earlier in the month. Akhtar earned international fame during the World Cup in England this year when he was tipped to become the first bowler to break the 100-miles-an-hour (160-kilometre) barrier. His action was first questioned during the limited overs game in Australia when Australian officials sent video footage to the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) claiming his action was suspect. Pakistan cricket officials had mainatined Akhtar's action was correct. A national panel of experts viewed video footage from the ICC last week and gave him a green light for Australia. In October, the ICC also advised tearaway fast bowler, Shabbir Ahmed, to improve his action. Shabbir was initially selected for the Test tour of Australia but was pulled out after the ICC's directive.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/akhtars-action-illegal", "date": "2000-01-01T00:00:29+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 666},
{"title": "New millennium dawns across the world", "body": "LONDON, Jan 1: Spectacular celebrations united millions of people across the globe on Saturday, as the new millennium was ushered in untroubled by computer failures, terrorist attacks or mass suicides, reports AFP. In London, fireworks and the traditional rendition of Auld Lang Syne marked midnight GMT at Millennium Dome, directly over the Greenwich Meridian. The midnight sky above the British capital was lit up Saturday by a spectacular display of pyrotechnics, when on the stroke of midnight, more than 40,000 fireworks were set off in a carefully-coordinated movement along a five-kilometre (three-mile) stretch of the River Thames. Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Tony Blair, his pregnant wife Cherie and thousands of others toasted each other with champagne at the dome, the showcase of festivities in London. One hour earlier Paris brought in the millennium with an explosion of light and sound that made the Eiffel Tower appear to take off like a rocket and shook the entire city to its foundations. With three minutes to go before midnight, the base of the century-old structure exploded in a white star-burst, as the first of 20,000 flash-bulbs and 5,000 fireworks erupted in in a synchronized frenzy. Traditional street parties and hi-tech firework displays captured the imaginations of revellers in Madrid, Rome, Vienna, Berlin and in towns and villages across the continent. On a truly global night of celebration while 700,000 Swedes braved freezing temperatures to attend a open-air party in Stockholm's old town the citizens of Kinshasa, capital of the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo greeted midnight with bongoes and cries of \"Bonana.\" Most police forces in Europe reported that crowds had been well behaved during what was seen as a family event. The only major outbreaks of violence took place in Denmark where a skirmish between stone-throwing leftist youths and Copenhagen police lead to four arrests, and the now traditional spate of arson attacks on parked cars in Paris and some regional French towns. In Tromso, Norway, a man died when he fell from a rock while watching fireworks. After the enthusiasm in Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific and much of Asia a strong dose of politics and religion intervened as the Middle East only partially joined in the festivities. In Bethlehem in the West Bank, 2,000 doves soared into the air to the crackling of fireworks in an unprecedented party for the Palestinians, coinciding as it did with the night-time feasting of the final Friday of Ramadan. In Israel rumours were rife that Christian sects could perform a mass suicide, but as midnight passed Jerusalem, in the grip of the Jewish sabbath, was one of the quietest cities on the planet. The other main celebration in the Middle East was in Egypt, which ushered in its eighth millennium with a \"cyberconcert\" by French musician Jean-Michel Jarre at the pyramids. Elsewhere the overwhelmingly Muslim Middle East largely turned its back on the festivities, with a Saudi prayer leader sternly warning that it was strictly forbidden to mark the occasion. Further west in Moscow's Red Square, at least 50,000 revellers digested the surprise of President Boris Yeltsin's resignation earlier in the day and gathered to see fireworks lighting up the sky. The nuclear energy systems of Russia and Ukraine passed the critical date-change without any problems, Russian Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov said. In Colorado Springs, where the United States and Russia are monitoring each other's missile systems for possible Y2K glitches, Russian Colonel Sergey Kaplin said Yeltsin's resignation showed that Moscow was not concerned about Y2K problems. But the goodwill which brought Russians out into the streets in Moscow did not extend to their forces in Chechnya which continued to bombard Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic, reported an AFP photographer situated 10 kilometres (7 miles) from the city. The New Year had got underway hours earlier, on tiny, uninhabited Millennium Island, off Kiribati, and moved across the South Pacific to be welcomed by vast crowds packing cities across New Zealand, Australia and East Asia. In Auckland the new century's first baby, a boy, was reportedly born and not even looming clouds could hold back the biggest crowds Sydney has ever seen for a massive 3.8 million-dollar firework display. The scene was repeated across East Asia as millions took to the streets of Tokyo, Manila, Seoul, Hong Kong, Beijing, Bangkok, Singapore, Taipei and Kuala Lumpur for parties, fireworks extravaganzas and official ceremonies.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/new-millennium-dawns-across-the-world", "date": "2000-01-02T00:00:10+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 729},

{"title": "How are the Omens for South Asia in the New Era?", "body": "As all look forward to a better political, economic and social climate across the world in the new century, we in South Asian region too are longing for a better future for understandable reasons. Here, \"century\" and \"new year\" are more pronounced than \"millennium\" since a controversy does yet exist whether the new millennium begins this year or next year. Despite the euphoria all over about the \"New millennium\", fact remains that many authoritative quarters have claimed that the new millennium does not exactly begin this year, but next year. Without going into the controversy, one can conclude that millennium is an occasion that comes once after 1000 years, so celebrations surrounding it can still be justified a year before even if it starts next year. Anyway, the point I am seeking to drive home is that all eagerly feel and hope that the new year, new century and for that matter the new millennium will witness lesser hostility, belligerence and acrimony in the world. But, while a happy and healthy society devoid of all these dangerous elements that are presently afflicting peace and stability is certainly the most desirable thing, it will be height of folly to expect that such a happy situation will surely emerge. Political philosopher Plato's \"Ideal State\" remains a utopia but there is no denying that a nearest substitute of this can definitely be achieved provided wisdom, sanity and judgement for the good prevail replacing the conditions that batter the pitch of tranquillity and stability. The pious hopes notwithstanding, the new phase that has begun with the first day of the current year does not seem to augur well for many parts of the world. Despite the hopes for a better future being expressed on this occasion by personalities ranging from Bill Clinton, president of the most powerful nation on world to the leaders of tiny nations, some of the indications that synchoronised with the advent of the new year appear to bode ill as well. It seems particularly applicable for the South Asian region where the hopes for a better environment is craved for more than anywhere else. For, the political and even the social conditions here are certainly showing distressing metamorphosis while economically most of the people are mired in abject poverty. The island state of Sri Lanka, reeling under a prolonged civil war on the issue of the demand by minority Tamils for an independent state, witnessed another attack by a suicide bomber in the first week of the new year claiming 13 lives. Coming close on the heels of a similar attack on president Chandrika Kumaratunga on December 18 in which she narrowly escaped but many others were killed, this attack was aimed at probably prime minister Mrs Srimavo Bandarnaike, mother of the president, and other ministers. This time also the main target seems to have been missed out but the woman suicide bomber killed security personnel and others when challenged before the prime minister's residence and blew herself off. Certainly, the civil war in Sri Lanka is one of the main trouble spots in the world and hopes for a solution of this seemingly intractable imbroglio in the coming days, following the recent presidential elections, are unlikely to bear any fruit since the separatists have sent a clear signal through the latest attack about their thoughts. Barring a near-miraculous positive development, the island state appears destined to experience more and more bloodshed as the settlement of the Government-Tamil confrontation remains a distant goal with both sides hardening their stances. The fall-out of the hijacking episode of an Indian Airlines passenger flight is likely to further sour the relationship between two powerful neighbours in South Asia- India and Pakistan. After seven agonising days, all passengers, except one killed earlier, were released by five hijackers but not before extracting their main demand - release of three Kashmiri militant leaders from jails in India. This issue has further worsened the hostile relationship between the two neighbours. Indian prime minister A B Vajpayee called upon different nations to consider and declare Pakistan as a \"terrorist state\" while Pakistan's military ruler General Pervez Musharraf rejected charges that his country had encouraged the hijacking. Islamabad has also stiffened its position on \"Kashmir\" and says no improvement of the ties is possible without addressing the crux of the problem which is \"Kashmir\". This is a kind of departure from the policy followed by dismissed elected government of Nawaz Sharif which believed that overall relations can be improved and various forms of cooperation between New Delhi and Islamabad can continue while efforts would continue to solve the main \"Kashmir\" problem. Obviously, the hijacking drama has come as a bad omen in their already belligerent ties and it can be said with a large degree of certainty that new year bodes no encouraging signs for peace and friendship for the two. It goes without saying that tensions in the region stem from Indo-Pakistan ties and this tendency has exacerbated since both countries detonated nuclear devices in May, 1998. When there is little likelihood of a thaw in their apparently bitter relations and, on the contrary, indications are discernible for bigger animosity. We in Bangladesh are evidently bracing for political unrest in the face of opposition demand of early elections and government's refusal to give in and willingness to stay in power till the term is over. Political turmoil which means more strikes, violence, loss of lives etc. are on the cards. But what is alarming is the break-down in the social security. The incident of molestation of a young woman at the Dhaka university campus area in the midst of the celebrations of the new Millennium is the tip of the iceberg. Such incidents have not occurred anywhere in the region and not even in many advanced countries where wild festivities usually do take place. The much-talked about incident has only signalled the deterioration of social values. An alert home minister Mohammad Nasim has assured that the culprits will be brought to book. But the question is where are we really heading for? How can we respond to the challenges of a new era and identify ourselves as a dignified nation coming through a bloody liberation war nearly three decades ago, if the mental make-up comes down to such lowest ebb! As we have stepped into a new century, four major countries of South Asian region are in news in negative perspective. The dealing of the hijacking by the Vajpayee government has sparked off a debate in India itself. Some Kashmiri militant organisations may seek to draw sustenance from the release of their three leaders. Islamabad and New Delhi are expected to exchange even harsher words and consequently the relations may further nose dive. Sri Lanka is in the despair of an never-ending war. We in Bangladesh are gripped in despondency while also trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel which, however, is not noticeable as such except one being philosophically optimist about the future. South Asia has entered the new year, new century or the \"new millennium\" with more bad omens than good around it. Let us still try to hope that things may change for the good!", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/how-are-the-omens-for-south-asia-in-the-new-era", "date": "2000-01-12T00:00:42+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1204},

{"title": "Musharraf for keeping uniform for 2 more yrs", "body": "Pakistan's government has asked Islamist opposition parties to give President Pervez Musharraf two years to relinquish leadership of the army, a senior Islamic party MP said Monday. The suggestion, revealed by the parliamentary leader of the religious right alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, comes as pressure mounts on General Musharraf to abandon his dual posts. \"A heavyweight government figure last week suggested to the MMA leadership that it should consider giving two years to Musharraf to shed his military uniform,\" Ahmed told AFP. Musharraf's dual role as army chief and unelected president are under fire from the MMA and fellow opposition parties Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Demands that he quit the military and submit to a standard presidential election have brought the seven-month-old parliament -- the first since Musharraf began his three-year military rule -- to a standstill. The suggestion of a two-year deadline came at a meeting Friday between Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman that was also attended by Ahmed and ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) party president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain. The fundamentalist JUI is a leading element in the MMA's six-party religious right alliance. The Islamists had already offered to give Musharraf until August 14, when Pakistan celebrates the 56th anniversary of its creation, to quit the military. They have also pledged to back him in a presidential poll. The PPP and PML-N, taking a tougher line, are demanding he quit both posts immediately. The MMA has threatened to mobilise millions of supporters should Musharraf maintain his two posts. The MMA's Rehman and Ahmed responded to the request to give Musharraf two more years in uniform with a suggestion he step down from the presidency. \"The MMA told government leaders that Musharraf can put a man of his choice into the presidency if he does not want to shed his military uniform,\" Ahmed said, adding the MMA would back the pro-Musharraf PML-Q's Hussain as president. Musharraf, the army chief who stole power in military coup in October 1999 and declared himself president in 2001, last year amended the constitution to unilaterally extend his dual tenure for another five years.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/musharraf-for-keeping-uniform-for-2-more-yrs", "date": "2003-05-27T00:00:41+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 366},
{"title": "HC verdicts on police promotion upheld", "body": "The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court on Sunday dismissed two leave petitions filed by the government challenging a High Court verdict. The High Court upheld an Administrative Tribunal judgement that said promotion of 135 officiating assistant superintendents of police (ASPs) should take effect from 1998 instead of 1991, as the government had ordered. The bench comprising Justice Ruhul Amin, Justice Abu Sayeed Ahammed and Justice Fazlul Haq passed the order terming that promotion of 135 officiating ASPs \"unlawful\". The Inspector General of Police (IGP) in 1998 promoted 135 Inspectors to the rank of ASP with effect from March 20, 1991. But the Public Service Commission (PSC) recommended that their promotion be effective from January 28, 1998. The ASPs recruited directly by the PSC went to the Administrative Tribunal against the order. The tribunal in its verdict said the promotion was not sustainable. Then the government and the officiating ASPs took the case to the Appellate Tribunal, which also upheld the verdict. The officiating ASPs and the government then filed two leave petitions against the order with the Appellate Division. After hearing, the bench upheld the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal. Dr Kamal Hossain, Advocate Khadakar Mahbub Uddin and Advocate Mahbubur Rahman moved the petition for the directly recruited ASPs. Barrister Moinul Hossain and Wadud Bhuiyan stood for the departmental ASPs. Additional Attorney General Abdur Razzak represented the government. Sources said 85 of the officiating ASPs were made Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) during the period.

{"title": "APF suspends 3 refs", "body": "Three Paraguayan referees were suspended Tuesday after being implicated in a corruption scandal following the emergence of recorded conversations featuring late Argentinian football godfather Julio Grondona. Carlos Amarilla, Rodney Aquino and Carlos Caceres were suspended by the Paraguayan Football Association (APF) after the release of the Grondona tapes in Argentina on Sunday. Former FIFA vice-president Grondona, who died in 2014 aged 82, was regarded as one of the most powerful figures in South American football until his death last year. However he was repeatedly linked to corruption allegations during his 35-year reign over Argentine football. Conversations published on Sunday by Canal America TV in Argentina appeared to confirm Grondona's role in corruption, pointing to his involvement in match-fixing, rigging schedules and refereeing appointments. In one of the recordings, Grondona appears to be discussing a 2013 Copa Libertadores match between Argentine giants Boca Juniors and Brazilian team Corinthians which was overseen by referee Amarilla. \"It turned out well in the end. Nobody wanted this crazy bastard, and the guy who gave Boca the best support it had last year was (referee Carlos) Amarilla,\" Grondona is heard to say before bursting into laughter.

{"title": "President's New Year Thought", "body": "PRESIDENT Shahabuddin Ahmed's new year address to the almost half-empty Jatiya Sangsad on Saturday, with the opposition boycotting it, was a regulation annual speech of the head of state in the form of a review of governmental activities in the past year. What was sought to be mirrored thereby is the direction of events in national affairs tinged with the President's insights into how things had gone in the preceding year. It was important for the Opposition to have heard at first-hand the President's new year address to the parliament, more because of the fact that it coincided with the dawn of a new Century. It is one thing to read it second hand from newspaper reports or even go through an officially printed copy of the same, and it is entirely another to serve public interest by critically analysing the speech on the floor of the House itself and pointing out where the government had failed. And that is where the opposition has faltered showing little sensitivity to a routine requirement, not to speak of the special public expectation for their version of things into the new millennium. And there was so much for them to say on the President's address to the Parliament. We would like to be extremely selective with the contents of the President's speech to make our observations on. First of all, in an oblique reference to the exacerbated state of political polarisation in the country, the President urged the leaders of political parties and the people to forget individual and party interests for the sake of greater national good. He has reasoned quite powerfully as to why must the national interest be kept uppermost in our minds. We have collectively sacrificed much too much for the establishment of Bangladesh and preservation of democracy to be self-centred and bitterly partisan now in our approach to what fundamentally are social or national concerns and problems. Secondly, the political culture has become so self-serving that all kinds of institutions, political, administrative, social and economic, have been weakened by it. Thus democracy faces a wider institutional distortion than the mere fact of the parliament working ineffectively. Last, but not the least, proliferation of petty political squabbles has been a stumbling-block to the effort for strengthening the foundations of democracy which is indispensable for achieving economic freedom, an agenda that remains unaddressed even after 28 years of our attaining political freedom.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/presidents-new-year-thought", "date": "2000-01-03T00:01:32+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 402},
{"title": "SEC to lift circuit breaker to revive capital market", "body": "In a major move to revive the market, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to withdraw the circuit breaker, which will allow stock prices to jump or fall beyond the now-imposed band. But a \"case-to-case\" review will be there for scrips behaving abnormally. The decision will take \"immediate\" effect after certain formalities by the bourses, according to a senior SEC official. Two officials, one each from SEC and the stock exchange, will jointly monitor the market and decide on applying a circuit breaker when a particular scrip will rise or fall against market fundamentals. \"It was a necessary step,\" the SEC official said, explaining the regulators' prompt response to brokers' plea made yesterday. \"It is a bold decision to revive the market.\"A 10 per cent across-the-board band was slapped more than a year ago when the market was going through dramatic ups and downs. The market wasn't behaving still, resulting in a reduction of the band to five per cent. It was again raised to 10 per cent when the index kept falling. The prices would, however, be allowed to fluctuate more when companies would make price-affecting disclosures such as announcement of dividends, right or bonus shares, expansion or mergers. The validity would remain for three days within such price-affecting announcements. \"In international markets, in the US for instance, circuit breakers are used only in individual cases when they are behaving peculiarly,\" the official said, giving the rationale behind the SEC decision. Similarly, when prices will fluctuate abnormally, for example without any price-sensitive disclosures, the monitors will intervene based on a general guideline framed by the SEC. DSE councillors, frantically looking for ways to prop up the bearish market, had a meeting with the SEC supremos yesterday as part of their efforts. The discussions which followed a similar meeting with the finance minister the previous day concentrated mainly on creating confidence as a means of market revival. But the DSE bosses are looking for new sources of funds as the key priority. They will meet the commerce minister today to find ways for insurance funds to be chanelled into the capital market. On Thursday, they will see the central bank governor to try to amend banking regulations obstructing flow of funds into the stock market. For the capital market regulators, automation at DSE was set at the top of the immediate agenda, which the SEC officials, in keeping with their current campaign, said would ensure transparency in transactions and trading. The SEC, which had earlier slapped a deadline on DSE to go on-line by March, asked for a status report. The councillors said a task force headed by FBCCI president and DSE councillor Yusuf Abdullah Harun was already working to devise an action plan which should be ready by January 20. The DSE is lagging far behind the CSE, which has already finished its automation work. The SEC officials said brokers should submit periodic statements of transactions on their own accounts, which might be made mandatory after a gazette notification soon. Some councillors' bid to discuss the court cases against some of them was averted citing the issues' being sub-judice. While an early entry of merchant banks was highlighted as a necessity, the fact that many of the firms awaiting licences did not have \"adequate manpower\" surfaced as a problem. A SEC official admitted that a wrong approach guided the SEC evaluators while scrutinising the applications. \"We gave most weightage to companies having two crore taka, but not on their capability to do the job,\" the official said. \"The emphasis was wrongly placed.\"Responding to DSE councillors' plea, the SEC also agreed to examine whether the regulations could be reviewed to bring in more mutual funds. \"Here as well, the essential handicap is professional manpower of the companies,\" the official said. \"It was agreed that the ICB, the top institutional player in the market, was not being able to do it alone. Alternatives will have to be examined to create a facilitating atmosphere.\"They also discussed appointment of DSE CEO, another important step necessary to separate management from policymaking. The process is being delayed as the new Council after taking over sought fresh applications for the job.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/sec-to-lift-circuit-breaker-to-revive-capital-market", "date": "1998-01-06T00:00:03+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 697},
{"title": "Iraqi Kurds prepare for war against Saddam", "body": "Iraqi Kurdish militia, including hundreds of women, are intensifying their training amid the growing prospect of a new war against the forces of President Saddam Hussein. \"Yes!\" exclaimed their commander Mustafa Said Qader when asked if he was impatient for the start of the expected US-led offensive against Saddam's regime, which Washington accuses of concealing weapons of mass destruction. Qader, who says he was held for 15 months and tortured in an Iraqi jail a dozen years ago, would like nothing better than to kill the man he calls the \"dictator\" with his bare hands, though he would accept a due process followed by a hanging. However, like all the other political and military chiefs of Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), Qader has no idea what role US President George W. Bush has in mind for Saddam's domestic opponents. \"Will the Americans decide to attack alone or in partnership with the Iraqi opposition?\" he asked, while rejecting any repetition of the Afghan scenario, where US forces helped the Northern Alliance rebels to overthrow the Taliban. Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which shares control over autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan with the PUK, was quoted by the Lebanese press as saying Monday that his forces would play no part in an upcoming war. Talabani was less clear, saying in Tehran last week that \"the Americans have not asked us to cooperate militarily against Saddam Hussein; we have our own plans.\" He also spoke up against a \"military occupation\" of Iraq and said it was not part of US planning. Both Barzani and Talabani are agreed that they will not accept any attempt by Turkey to take advantage of the situation by entering Iraq from the north alongside US forces. \"No one has asked anything of us,\" agreed PUK official Adnan al-Mufti, who predicted hostilities would begin at the end of February. Asked about the reported presence of US Central Intelligence Agency operatives in Iraqi Kurdistan, he replied: \"The Americans come and go all the time. I don't know whether they belong to the CIA, but we have good relations with them.\" Even though Saddam's troops may be too busy defending their key cities, including the northern base of Kirkuk on the fringes of Kurdistan, the Kurds fear reprisal attacks from them, including with chemical weapons as has happened in the past. \"We are prepared for every eventuality,\" Qader said. \"We have already paid a heavy price, but if we must pay more for a democratic Iraq, we will do it. That is why we have been training harder than ever.\" Qader said the PUK can mobilise 20,000-25,000 guerrillas, known as peshmergas, and the KDP almost as many. With reservists, the numbers might double. But he admitted they have hardly any weapons apart from their Kalashnikov assault rifles and a few rocket-launchers. Among them is Lieutenant Sirwa Ismael, 28, and her battalion of 500 women soldiers, who says she has a \"personal\" score to settle with Saddam. \"His men destroyed my village\", she said, declining to give details, as she drilled her troops in the Suleimaniya training camp.

{"title": "US blames Saddam for 'initiating attack'", "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 26: US military officials says they regret the civilian casualties caused by an American missile attack in southern Iraq, but they say the blame lies with President Saddam Hussein for threatening US pilots patrolling Iraqi skies, reports AP. Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of US forces in the Gulf area, said Monday the American military will continue to hit Iraqi air defence radars, missiles and communications facilities in response to what he called increasingly hostile actions by Iraq. Zinni said Iraq tripled the number of surface-to-air missile, or SAM, batteries in the southern \"no-fly\" zone patrolled by US and British warplanes in recent weeks. He said Iraqi fighter aircraft are trying to draw allied pilots into \"SAM-bushes'' in hopes of shooting one down. Zinni said he could not yet confirm that the extensive damage and casualties to residential areas in and around the southern port city of Basra on Monday was caused by errant US missiles. \"We deeply regret any civilian casualties regardless of what the cause may be,\" he said. \"But these exchanges have been initiated by Saddam Hussein.\" He said the United States wanted its Arab allies in the region to understand that US missile attacks do not target civilians. \"No one can guarantee that these strikes will not have errors or we might not have errant ordnance, but we do take every possible attempt to ensure that doesn't happen,\" Zinni said. The four-star Marine Corps general said it was premature to consider apologising for the civilian losses.

In Iraq, Basra governor Ahmed Ibrahim Hamash said two American aircraft fired five missiles that killed 11 people and injured 59. The official Iraqi News Agency said one American missile hit the Al-Jumhuriya neighbourhood of Basra, a southern port city. Others hit later in the nearby village of Abu al-Khaseeb, as well as the Basra airport and an oil field. US officials said the American planes targeted an Iraqi SA-3 surface-to-air missile battery north of Basra and \"associated integrated air defense systems.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/us-blames-saddam-for-initiating-attack-2", "date": "1999-01-27T00:00:24+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 360},

The defendants of the case include Opposition Chief Whip Zainul Abdin Farroque, BNP leaders Amanullah Aman, Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, AZM Zahid Hossain, advocate Abed Raja, Md Shajahan and Jatiya Ganatantrik Party chief Shafiul Alam Pradhan. The case was filed with Paltan Police Station under the Speedy Trial Act. Masud Ahmed Talukder, a pro-BNP lawyer, told The Daily Star the charge sheet was submitted implicating leaders of BNP-led 18-party opposition alliance to keep them out of the election. According to the provisions of the Speedy Trial Act, the IO has to complete investigation of the case within seven working days and submit the charge sheet against the accused. If all the accused are arrested red-handed or on bail in any case, the trial court must have to complete the trial proceedings of the case within 45 working days, the act says. Sub-Inspector Mahmudul Hasan, who led the investigation, submitted the charge sheet to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court in Dhaka yesterday afternoon. The IO, however, dropped names of six other accused from the charge sheet, saying their involvement in the incidents was not proved. Police are yet to complete the probe into a blast case filed in connection with the same incident before the BNP office on March 11. The law enforcers detained 157 leaders and activists of the BNP-led alliance during a raid on the BNP headquarters on that day after cocktails went off at a rally in front of the office. Of the detained leaders, BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, its vice chairman Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and Dhaka city unit convener Sadeque Hossain Khoka were released the next day. Paltan police filed two cases against the 154 detained opposition leaders and activists the same day. On March 20, 151 opposition leaders and activists except Zainul, Aman and Rizvi were placed on remand for their alleged involvement in assaulting police and blasting cocktails near the BNP's Nayapaltan office. Such a large number of people had never been remanded at a time before in the country's history. Previously, the highest number of accused remanded in any case was 60, according to the court records.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/148-opposition-men-charged", "date": "2013-03-25T00:00:55+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 386},
{"title": "India working on package to help ailing state-run banks", "body": "India is drawing up a comprehensive package to help state-run banks, Minister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha said on Wednesday, as part of efforts to nurse them back to health and improve the flow of credit to industry. State lenders, which dominate India's banking system, were hit hard by a surge in bad loans after a slowdown in economic growth following the 2008 global financial crisis. Stress tests carried out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed that gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a ratio of total loans could rise to 4.8 percent by September from 4.6 percent in March, before dipping to 4.7 percent by March 2016. The last week blamed rising bad loans for making lenders reluctant to pass on cuts in interest rates to borrowers and approve new loans. \"NPAs are simply a symptom of the underlying issues that need to be resolved,\" Sinha told a gathering of private equity investors. \"We are preparing a comprehensive package which we will bring out shortly.\" As part of the package, New Delhi is trying to improve corporate governance and strengthen management at state-run banks, Sinha said. It is also overhauling annual targets for public sector lenders to increase the focus on efficiency. The government has also agreed to inject about $3 billion into the banks this fiscal year and could double that amount next year to shore up their capital. But private analysts reckon the banks need much more. Ratings agency Fitch estimates Indian lenders need more than $200 billion to prepare for the full implementation of new international capital adequacy rules in the next four years. Sinha said he would meet banks over the next two days in Bangalore to fine-tune their capital-raising plans. \"We are trying to understand exactly what's their capital requirement going to be in the next one to three years,\" he said. \"We are there to support and provide them the capital.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/business/global-business/india-working-package-help-ailing-state-run-banks-105943", "date": "2015-07-02T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 320},

{"title": "CWAB on warpath again", "body": "The leading cricketers of the country, under the banner of Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), have apparently launched a fresh movement against Bangladesh Cricket Board(BCB) following the board's decision to refuse seven players from collecting their tokens yesterday for the forth-coming inter-club transfers of the Premier Division League to be held from January 17 to 19. The board had earlier banned the seven cricketers concerned--Minhazul Abedin, Aminul Islam, Khaled Mahmud, Enamul Hoque, Mohammad Rafique, Mahbubur Rahman and Faruque Ahmed-- from taking part in the transfers in its last meeting on December 31 after a complaint from the Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolitan(CCDM), the organisers of the league. The CCDM had accused the players of misconduct and making objectionable remarks against top officials during the CWAB's demonstration for an early transfer last November. The BCB has formed a two-member probe committee to look into the complaint. The committee will submit its report on January 21. On the first day of issuing yesterday, the seven cricketers in question along with some hundred other players went to the BCB office to collect their tokens. According to Minhazul, who is also the president of CWAB, he asked the two CCDM officials in charge for his token. The officials refused by saying that their hands were tied. Minhazul along with some other cricketers then went to the acting general secretary of BCB Mahmud Ul Haq Manu and requested for their tokens. Manu also declined to provide them with tokens by showing the BCB instructions. When Minhazul inquired why they have not been informed by the BCB about this penalty, Manu failed to answer. The cricketers, after being refused by Manu, then gathered at a corner of the BCB office and announced that they would not take part in the transfers unless the board allows all the seven cricketers to take part in the transfer. The CWAB also demanded that if the BCB wants to ban players, it has to ban all the 240 cricketers who took part in the November movement for an early transfer. It was learnt that the CWAB later called on State Minister for Youth and Sports Obaidul Quader at his NSC office in the evening. Talking to The Daily Star last night, Minhazul Abedin confirmed about their meeting with the State Minister and said that the Minister has assured them of a solution. \"We have not been served with any notice by the board. How were we expected to know about the ban?\" said a frustrated Minhaz. \"We have played the National League after getting assurance from the BCB president. Now the board is saying that we shall not be allowed to take part in the transfer. This is not fare. 'We want to take part in the transfers and that is our only demand now. ' We have not yet decided anything. What we want is a solution to this problem immediately,\" Minhaz added. When contacted over telephone, Mahmud Ul Haq Manu confirmed that the cricketers went to him and asked for the tokens. \"On legal grounds, we could not issue tokens to the seven cricketers who have been barred from taking part in the transfers unless the investigation on them is over,\" said Manu. \"If they collect tokens now, they will be in deep trouble because the transfers will be held between January 17 to 19 while the report of the probe committee will not be available before January 21. If they draw their tokens now they will have to stay with their present clubs,\" Manu said. He also disclosed that two players have drawn their token yesterday. They are Pakistani all-rounder Saifullah Maksi of City Club and Hedayetlullah Turki of Wari Club. Meanwhile, BCB president Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who had earlier given his assurance to the cricketers about a rational settlement to the matter is scheduled to return on January 11 from the USA.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/cwab-on-warpath-again", "date": "2000-01-07T00:00:21+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 647},
{"title": "In Waugh's hands", "body": "Steve Waugh has the fate of his cricket career firmly in his control with Australian selectors restating on Sunday that they will judge him purely on form. The 37-year-old Australian skipper scored an unforgettable century to celebrate becoming only the third player to score 10,000 Test runs with an emotional innings in the fifth Ashes Test against England here on Friday. The 'Ice Man' of cricket played the innings of his life against the backdrop of mounting speculation about his immediate playing future. Waugh's 102 was his 29th Test century equalling cricket immortal Don Bradman's Australian record. \"Nothing has changed in regards to Stephen,\" chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said on Sunday. \"I said before this Test that he had our support through the Sydney Test and that he would be judged on form after that. \"The comment still stands. It's up to Steve to let us know what his plans are.\" Waugh has not said what his intentions are beyond the final Ashes Test but the general consensus is that he will be available to lead the Australian team to the Caribbean to play the West Indies in April-May. Australia's squad for the West Indies will be announced in March. The only possible factor that could convince Waugh to quit is that his hundred was so perfect in front of 41,931 home fans that nothing else he ever does in cricket could top it. Waugh told a press conference on Friday after his exhilarating century: \"I've always said that it's desire, commitment and passion that count and age has nothing to do with how well you're going to play. \"If you haven't got that burning desire, that inner strength, then there's no point in playing. \"Age is totally irrelevant, it's what's inside you and I don't believe in age determining whether you should be in the side or not.\" Waugh has already spoken during in recent months of his desire to tour India again, in a series scheduled for 2004. Australia lost the last series on the sub-continent in March 2001 when India pulled off a miraculous come-from-behind victory in Calcutta on the back of VVS Laxman's blazing 281 second innings to square the series and then win the deciding Chennai Test by two wickets.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/in-waughs-hands", "date": "2003-01-06T00:00:54+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 376},

I can remember, every year before Eid holidays; some of my classmates used to bring firecrackers to class and would sell those to us when none of the teachers were around! There was this one time, when I lit a small firecracker and put it inside my desk during the recess period, the cracker obviously exploded with a bang! Everybody ran to the classroom hearing the loud noise. Fortunately, I didn't get punished for this since nobody knew who was behind the mischief! I grew a passion for music from a very young age. I started playing the guitar when I was in school. I was not very interested in sports as I was never good at it. However, I joined the Boy Scout team in our school and enjoyed taking part in jamborees and other Scouting activities. After passing the SSC exam, I got myself admitted into Notre Dame College, Dhaka. I felt very liberated in college as I was finally free from the constant watch of my parents. I still cherish the memories of hanging out with my friends and chatting for long hours. Graduating from the college, I joined Bangladesh Institute of Science and Technology for my BBA. University was overall a new experience since for the first time I felt like an adult. I grew up an interest for acting in university. In fact, I did my first stage performance in a play during a cultural programme in the university. This was also the time when I joined Pracchyanat Acting School. It was a great learning experience as I got in touch with some very good actors. Eventually, I joined the Pracchyanat Theatre Group and I am still acting for them. I believe, for an actor, theatre helps a great deal to learn the basics of acting. I started my career in television with a play called 'Icche Holo' directed by noted director Amitabh Reza. I always enjoy performing for challenging roles. In 2011, I was nominated for the best critic award for a leading role in Meril-Prothom Alo Award Ceremony. I would always like to pursue my passion in acting. Plus, I also want to be an entrepreneur in future. I would like to suggest all the youngsters to follow their instincts.

In an interview with UNB yesterday, Kibria said exports during the first five months of fiscal 1997-98 has been rising \"vigorously\" with a growth of 20.18 per cent over the same period in last fiscal year. \"Since most of the exports go to Europe and North America, I expect the growth momentum to continue and remain unaffected by the Asian economic crisis,\" he said about the short-term export prospect. Cautioning about a possible slowdown in the long-term export prospect due to the massive devaluation caused by the currency crisis in Southeast Asia, he said, \"We have to remain vigilant in this respect.\" The finance minister, who mainly spoke on the economic condition during the first six months of the current fiscal, said the economy has been relatively stable with strong growth in the export sector. \"This is in sharp contrast to the severe economic crisis prevailing in many parts of Asia. Bangladesh has been able to stay out of the wave of economic disasters which have hit the Southeast and East Asian nations.\"Kibria said the inflation rate has been generally low at 4.67 per cent in November, though there has been slight increase in recent months. Imports have also not increased significantly, he added. The finance minister said remittances were growing, but at a rate less than last year's. During the July-November period, the inflow of remittances was 625.17 million US dollars against 580.74 million dollars in the same period of last year. The disbursement of foreign aid has grown during the period by 2.18 per cent mainly because there has been a decrease in food aid, he said. Kibria informed that the foreign exchange reserve was 1662.09 million US dollars on December 30 and said the main reason of the low reserve was the payment of loans under SAF and ESAF taken by the previous government. \"However, I am hopeful that the reserve will be rising in the coming months, though the rise may be slow,\" he said.

He said they will send a delegation of five to six members, headed by Lt Col Abu Jar al Zahid, commanding officer of 42 Rifles Battalion, and the names will be sent by tomorrow morning. According to a top BGB source, the Myanmar's letter reads the flag meet will be held at Maungdaw day after tomorrow. But the BGB officials are unwilling to disclose the date yet as it might change for any unexpected reason. Since BGB Nayek Razzak was abducted by the Myanmar border force on June 17 from the Naf River inside Bangladesh territory, the BGB had been requesting for a flag meeting to bring back Razzak with his licensed arms and ammunition. But Myanmar was dillydallying on the plea, saying some official formalities are the reasons of the delay. On Monday, Myanmar BGP tagged a condition that it will release Razzak if Bangladesh takes in 550 boatpeople found adrift at sea. They are among the 727 rescued by the Myanmar Navy from the Andaman Sea. State Minister for Home Assaduzzaman Khan Kamal today said Myanmar is \"going too far\" by attaching a condition to release abducted BGB Nayek Abdur Razzak. \"Now tagging that with Razzak's issue…we think they went too far and were asking for too much,\" Kamal said while talking to reporters after the 27th meeting of National Acid Control Council at the Secretariat. \"We'll bring them [the boatpeople] back on confirmation that they're Bangladeshis,\" he said, adding that they [Myanmar] agreed to treat the issues separately. Earlier on Monday, BGB Director General Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed also stated that Razzaq will be returned honourably with his personal weapon, ammunition etc unconditionally. Razzak was abducted following what the Bangladesh government says was a shooting in the Naf River at Cox's Bazar's Teknaf on Jun 17 between border patrols. A BGB soldier was shot in the incident caused by a \"misunderstanding\", while Nayek Razzak was abducted by Myanmar's BGP. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam wrote on his facebook wall: \"Nayek Abdur Razzak would be brought back soon. Arrangements are on. There is a Vienna Convention about the relationship of two countries and everybody should obey that. Disobeyed, there are also arrangements. We are aware of the dignity of our citizens, officials and members of the forces. Solving such issues requires patience, strategies and right decision. I know a citizen may not want to understand these facts. Have faith, I would tell them.\" In another development, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) expressed concerns and resentment over the incident of not returning the BGB nayek. In a statement, it said Myanmar authorities did not hand over Nayek Razzak even six days after the incident and that they are dillydallying over the issue. \"The commission thinks such incident is a clear violation of international law and human rights,\" the statement added. Besides, the NHRC believed that the way Myanmar authorities presented Nayek Razzak in the social networking sites; it demeaned his human rights and human dignity. The commission requested the Myanmar authorities to hand over Razzak to Bangladesh in sound physical condition. It also drew attention of the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission so that the Myanmar's commission request its government to send Nayek Razzak back.

{"title": "The Blessings of Capitalism", "body": "In the United States, 80 per cent of funds of political parties come from one per cent of the citizens, according to a US survey just published (reported in the DS of Dec 25), depicting an overall review of the state of prosperity in the world's richest nation, how good is capitalism, and the perils of materialism. While the number of billionaires have increased (202 to 268, and Bill Gates' worth is about the combined output of ten central/South American countries), the average poverty level has gone down, widening the gap between the top and the bottom levels. The earning power disparity is 40:1 at the two extremes; and one in five families using credit cards are in the red (he pays least who pays cash). Six out of every ten women work outside home, and earn less than men do for similar jobs; and 12.5 per cent families still live below the poverty line (as defined in the US). As for political funding in the US, 80 per cent of the party funds are contributed by one per cent of the citizens. What is the figure in Bangladesh? No published figures are available, but the guess is that in poorer countries, the ratio should be higher. That means around 90 per cent of the funds come from less than one per cent of the citizens within a population of 120m. Is there any Think Tank to compile such figures? It indicates the political influence of money over politics, and how politics is controlled by a very small minority of citizens. The election commissions in the LDCs have a tough time trying to control the influx of black money during election campaigns. The welfare of the society is concerned with the enhancement of the lives of the vast majority who have to live on limited and inadequate income; and this game has been going on for years in the third world countries, with revolutions and counter-revolutions decade after decade. Getting out of the vicious circle centrifugally needs great tangential energy, which has to be generated within the system. Democracy is publicised by the western world, and its institutionalisation are indirectly funded by the North donor and funding agencies. This is done in good faith at surface value, but the local environment cannot soak in these political fertilizers and goodies and produce visible fruits. The systems loss for such venture capital is high, which can be partly understood from the moral point of view. The hidden factor, it appears, is the indirect negative effect of the philosophy of materialism, practised so lavishly in the twentieth century, which is believed to be an offshoot of the western type of capitalism. Hedonism is at its peak now, and the stability had flattened out for generations. It is time for the downturn, and the signs should be visible during the millennium period. Man-made systems which last too long invite faster erosion at a later stage. At the other end of the scale, reports as cited above completely ignore the movements at the other end of the scale, namely, the world of micro-credits, which is symbolised by the dollar-a-day life cycle. The cumulative effect is huge, as two-thirds of the global population is involved. That is what the UN system is chasing, the alleviation of poverty, and associated health, education and economic factors involved. Next year, another report will come out, noting only marginal changes in the disparity. Big changes are needed to visibly affect the adverse conditions in the micro world. The world will be as busy as ever, with micro shifts through micro programmes. Today the debt-relief issue in the South has attracted international debate. The sums involved are huge, but, proportionately, the solutions are microscopic. The banks (monetary and flood-water) have to burst, to provide solutions of scale. On the other hand, the WTO is the problem of the richer countries at the other end of the economic scale. Two issues will always remain on the agenda: the problems of the poor, and the problems of the rich.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-blessings-of-capitalism", "date": "2000-01-12T00:00:01+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 676},

She knows this because her mother had told her that she had been only 40 days old when the country was freed and victory was announced. “It was sheetkal I think when I was born” which makes it likely that she was a December child. When you ask her what happened during that time she is a little taken aback; people like her do not have time to dwell on the past. Were people killed in your village? (a good starting point). “Oh yes my mother told me during the Shangram some men in uniform came and then they started taking people and lining them up and shooting them, there were even women among them.” So what is Shangram? Rabeya pauses and gives an embarrassed smile: “Who knows what it is” but then she adds, “But I know from my mother that five of my uncles joined something called the Mukti Bahini and one of them never came back. Who were these Mukti Bahini? 'Who knows, they went through the marshes to fight or something.” This she says in a bland tone before going back to mopping the floor. With a husband who is almost blind after a speck of wood fell into his eye and three young girls to put through school and feed, Independence Day does not have much meaning for her. Rabeya has never been able to appreciate the fruits of this priceless gift called Independence. Her entire life has been one of struggle. Living in a haor area in Shingpur (she cannot say what district it is under) all she can remember is the hardship her family went through. Her parents were poor and the three sisters were married off early. Rabeya and her husband along with their three girls came to Dhaka in search of work. The first time Rabeya came to work at the house in Cantonment she was a lively, attractive young woman; she wore colourful saris and sported an armlet her husband had given her that gave her a Bohemian look. But everything about Dhaka was alien to her – the tall buildings, busy streets, the leering men, even the houses where she worked part time seemed a little scary. In 2008 the entire busti she lived in was cleared out with bulldozers, leaving her and her family staring at the open sky while clutching on to a few belongings. Everything was gone – even the paltry savings she had hidden under some clothes. When she came to say goodbye with her youngest on her hip, she looked like the world had come to an end. Her sari torn, hair disheveled, she couldn't stop crying: “I have lost everything, we have nothing, the rain ruined all our clothes, someone stole most of our cooking pans when we fell asleep...” There were around two and a half lakh people in that area –all of them lost their homes in a single sweep of a bulldozer to make way for residential flats for the privileged. So Rabeya left with her semi-blind husband and three emaciated girls to stay at her husband's village. But there was nothing there for them there – no land, no work, no one to turn to. A housing scheme initiated apparently by the government for the 'ultra poor' turned out to be a scam that left her poorer and heavily in debt. Her only hope was to come back to Dhaka - harsh, brutal Dhaka but where at least you could earn a few takas doing something. Her husband's condition deteriorated over the years giving her the title of sole breadwinner of the family. Unlike her parents though, she made sure all three of her girls went to school. With the help of her employer she has managed to become part owner of a rickshaw – her brother-in-law drives it and she gets around TK 100 a day, enough to buy the daily groceries. She still works at the house in Cantonment and goes through the regular mishaps in her family. Her own health has taken heavy blows, her back is weak, she is heavily anaemic. Her face is permanently creased with worry – she worries about her husband who may go completely blind, her daughters who often fall ill and about when some storm or bulldozer will come and blow away the only home she has now – a tiny shack on a marshland kept up with stilts. She no longer wears the armlet. So do you know what '26 March Independence Day' is? She smiles disarmingly and says: “I don't really know anything but my girls read about it in their books and that day they will get a holiday.”", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/independence-day", "date": "2013-03-22T00:00:40+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 787},

{"title": "Policies and Issues in Resettlement of the Displaced", "body": "UNTIL recently, involuntary displacement of people for development purpose was treated in the national and international policy-making circles as an unavoidable side effect in the way of greater development goals. Therefore, involuntary displacement of people was all along the low priority area of such development projects, infrastructural components being the major focus of attention. Over the years, various studies, environmental and human right activist groups and NGOs have brought the plight of the displaced people to the forefront of development project consideration. New realisation which these studies and actions have generated, compelled the large scale developers bring about policy changes. Both World Bank and ADB now formally pursue policies of discouraging projects which require involuntary displacement of population. Where displacement is unavoidable, they have agreed to keep provision for adequate compensation, and resettlement of evacuees without compromising their previous economic standard. A major infrastructural development project currently being implemented in Bangladesh is the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project (JMBP). This project is funded by International Development Agency, Asian Development Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan. The estimated cost of the project is $ 900m. The bridge will provide direct transport link between north-west and eastern parts of the country. It is meant to end the relative isolation of the agriculturally fertile northwest region of Bangladesh and thus stimulate overall economic growth of the country. However, the project also involves displacement of people from their original land. The construction of the bridge itself has not caused any displacement, it is the construction of the two guide bunds, a hard point and approach roads which involved land acquisition (7,000 acres) and concomitant displacement. Resettlement Action Plan From the inception of the project, potential donors insisted on appropriate compensation and resettlement of the evicted people to be considered as integral part of the project. In view of the fact that donor money would not have been forthcoming without this component, GOB commissioned a Resettlement Action Plan, prepared by Randell, Palmer, Tritton and Bangladesh Consulting Ltd., (1990). The study, however, underestimated the number of the project-affected-people (PAP). In 1992 BRAC was commissioned to undertake a socio-economic baseline survey of the project-affected people (PAP) on the east side of the Jamuna river. The study divided the PAPs into two categories : directly-affected and indirectly-affected. Those who would lose their homestead, land or any other structure were considered to be directly affected people. Indirectly affected people were identified as those who would lose their source of income due to project implementation. This included farm and non-farm workers, tenant farmers, squatters and uthulis. This study came with a figure that 11,945 households with a population of 77,280 will be affected by the project, directly or indirectly only in the eastern side of the Jamuna river. There was, however, a further increase in the number of affected people, during the implementation of the project. According to the latest available information, 16,341 households, with a net population of about 100,000 have been affected by the project. Among them, 3,604 households have lost their homestead land entirely. Alongside, 32 community facilities, 13 educational institutions, 14 mosques, 2 cemeteries and one cooperative building had to be abandoned. A formal Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared in March 1993. Under World Bank's insistence, it was further revised. In October 1993, the revised resettlement action plan was endorsed. The resettlement work for the JMBP began basing on this Revised Resettlement Action Plan (RRAP). The RRAP treated resettlement and rehabilitation of PAP as a separate programme, with its own objectives and budget. It created a separate Resettlement Unit for managing and supervising the project. The budget of the project is Tk 236 crore amounting to 5 per cent of the total JMBP budget. Resettlement, under RRAP, has been conceived as a development programme. It upholds that affected people should be compensated for all quantifiable losses at a full replacement cost, compensation should also be paid to people who were affected indirectly, absence of legal title should not be made bar for paying compensation, proper incentive structure should be developed for host-guest integration, a resettlement site has to be prepared for those who would not be able to resettle on their own, NGOs will participate in project implementation. The October 1993 RRAP is primarily focused on the resettlement requirement of the eastern side of the bridge. The final location of the west guide bund, west bridge end and west bridge corridor, was then still uncertain. Therefore, it was decided, \"consecutive resettlement actions related to other components of the project will be derived by analogy from the RRAP.\" Compensation Fourteen categories of PAP have been identified in the RRAP who were entitled to get compensation. A compensation policy guideline was developed where the categories of losses were defined and entitlements for different kinds of losses, were spelt out. These were transfer grants, house construction grants, owner-cultivator grants, farm worker grants, non-farm worker grants, tenant cultivators' grants, dismantling and removal grants, reconstruction grants for commerce and industry, replacement land stamp duty grants, grants to cover premium, maximum allowable replacement value grants, grants for uthulis/squatters to purchase homestead land. People who were entitled for compensation, were termed as entitled persons (EP). Under the new arrangement, each of them was provided with an identity card and an entitlement card. To keep the process transparent, a computerised database has been created on each EP. The compensation process involved information campaign, group meeting and distribution of leaflets and brochures. A Grievance Committee was also set up. It was authorised with a power to act as a quasi-judicial body to pass order with respect to disputes over land ownership and compensation. The Grievance Committee could only take cases on land title-related disputes, if those were not pending in court. By 1996, all fourteen kinds of compensation have been paid in the eastern side and the EP files were formally closed. The Grievance Committee handled 8400 cases and according to the Resettlement Unit authority 89 per cent of these cases have been resolved by the committee and no EP had to take recourse to court. However, one may note that JMBP land acquisition work began at least two years before RRAP was prepared. By the time the RRAP and Resettlement Unit established, one-eighth of the land was already acquired. The District Commissioner's office handled compensation package for this group of people. According to Director, RU, the difference between the two compensation packages were reimbursed to this group with retrospective effect. However, it is difficult to comprehend that the authorities could track down all persons evicted two to three years earlier. The RRAP also had provision to cover the rights of those affected by river erosion or flooding caused by the bridge project. A $200m additional loan was sanctioned by IDA for compensating those persons who have lost or likely to lose their land, houses and sources of income, due to possible erosion in the area, caused by river training and construction of JMBP. The river erosion and flood-related compensation will be paid up to the year 2000. Area covered under this programme stretches from 8 km upstream and 10 km downstream of the bridge, including mainland and chars. Receiving compensation for loss of land due to erosion or flooding will not affect the land title of a person. If land of a compensated person in accreted again in natural way, within thirty years, the owner will be able to regain possession of her/his land. A baseline survey has been undertaken in this area and 28033 families have been registered whose land could be endangered. Compensation process has begun and satellite imageries are used to verify claims in this regard. If any of these household lose homestead they will be entitled to relocate themselves in the resettlement sites. Women-headed households of char areas will be given 20 per cent more transfer grant. Resettlement Two resettlement sites have been planned on both sides of the Jamuna river. During the initial phase planners were considering of resettling at least half the displaced population at the resettlement sites (1990). But as there was a large time gap between eviction and development of the resettlement sites, not very many people showed interest in resettling at the sites. In the eastern side out of 3604 households, 564 registered for allocation of resettlement plots. So far, 291 families have taken possession. The rest of the displaced households have resettled themselves elsewhere, mostly in the surrounding villages. Under the circumstances, RRAP defined resettlement in a broader term and included in it the task of helping the displaced find suitable homestead land in surrounding villages. It conducted a land market survey and disseminated information among the EPs on land available in the adjoining areas. The Director of RU reported that 90 per cent of the displaced people have been able to purchase homestead land with or without the help of RU. Forty-five per cent of the EPs who lost arable land could replace theirs. He further claimed, this is a major achievement, and is a record for World Bank-financed projects. The western resettlement site has yet to become suitable for habitation. Basic infrastructure such as school, health-care centre, mosque, marketplace, road, community centre are still under construction. RU also undertook some programmes for smooth integration of the evicted people with the host villages. After eviction it was seen that some villages hosted as many as hundred of such households. This naturally overloaded the carrying capacity of some communities and, in cases, created tension. In order to ease such tension and ensure that the host community do not see the PAPs as burden, it developed an incentive structure. This include building infrastructure in host areas on the basis of their needs assessment. So far 16 educational institutions, seven mosques, 80 tubewells, 800 sanitary latrines, 10 km road have been constructed in the host villages. After the construction site was identified in the west bank area, a baseline survey has been undertaken to identify the affected people. A similar type of resettlement programme will begin in the west bank. NGO Involvement Various NGOs have become active partners of the Resettlement Unit in implementing RRAP. It has been stated earlier that the 1992 baseline survey of the east bank was conducted by BRAC. The same NGO was also responsible for the 1996 survey which determined the possible impact of JMBP on the people of surrounding river erosion and flood-prone areas. In the compensation programme of this component BRAC is also working as an implementing partner with RU. While implementing the east bank compensation and resettlement programme RU engaged a local NGO from Sirajganj named Rural Development Movement (RDM). The organization was engaged to provide necessary institutional support in identifying, informing and mobilising the PAPs. It was empowered to issue identity and entitlement cards. RDM prepared computerised EP files and determined individual entitlements. RDM representative was one of the members of the three-member Grievance Committee. RADOL, a local NGO from Tangail, got involved with the resettlement process to look after the nutritional aspect of the displaced people. They mainly provided homestead sapling to the evicted population. Later, the survey of the affected areas of the west bank was conducted by RADOL. Kishan, another local NGO, has been engaged in plantation in the resettlement site. As a part of the resettlement and rehabilitation programme, a hospital was constructed by RU at the east bank resettlement site. RU under an agreement leased out the hospital to Grameen Kalyan, a sister organization of Grameen Bank, for ninety-nine years. Grameen Kalyan has developed a health-care system for the PAPs. The hospital will maintain computerized health record of the PAPs. A contract has also been signed with Grameen Matshya Foundation (GMF), another sister organization of the Grameen Bank, and Shubash. Under the agreement Tk 1 crore interest-free loan has been provided to these NGOs for fish cultivation. They have also been given 25 years lease of derelict water bodies for this purpose. As per the agreement, the NGOs will get 60 per cent of the profit and the PAPs will get the rest. With the broad goal of ensuring the pre-eviction economic status of the PAPs intact, a Tk 5 crore credit programme has been designed. Three thousand EPs have been identified for participating in training and credit programmes. PKSF has been contracted to supervise the credit programme. Two NGOs DORP and ASAUS have been selected through open tender as implementing NGOs. In case of NGO selection as partners it was found that RDM, RADOL, DORP and ASAUS were selected through bidding. RDM, however, was selected through a limited tender, the rest through open tender. BRAC and Grameen Kalyan was approached by RU to participate in the programme. GMF on the other hand approached RU with the fish cultivation proposal. A Preliminary Assessment JMBP resettlement programme is the first planned resettlement programme of Bangladesh. It is understandable that implementation of such a project has been a complex task. Among other problems, cumbersome land acquisition law, non-updated land ownership and absence of updated land document, work as hindrance in the way of delivering the compensation package to the affected people. A problem that the project faced, has been the development of vested interest groups for reaping undue benefits. For example, a group of people who had prior information about land acquisition, raised structures, sometime overnight, in order to qualify for drawing structure loss grant and other benefits accruing from it. Critics point out that such practice could only take place because of collusion of interest of locally influential and local government functionaries. This problem could only be addressed through promulgation of a new ordinance, which authorised the DC to deny compensation to new structures. The Ordinance was later passed by the Parliament in 1995. Another policy which went against the interest of the affected people was the land price fixation system. Undervaluing of land price for tax purpose is a common practice in Bangladesh. But the method followed to determine land price for compensation, was to average the price of a few randomly selected plots at the value shown during registration. This has led to undervaluing of land. Before RRAP became operational, allegations were made by some EPs about malpractice of DC office in paying compensation. They claimed they had to bribe functionaries to draw their compensation money. Time difference between eviction and providing access to resettlement site was another policy lapse. During the initial phase of preparation of resettlement plan, one-half of the evicted people showed their interest for settling in the resettlement site. But not even one-quarter of the displaced households actually purchased plots in the resettlement site. Policy makers see it as a positive sign that people were getting resettled in the surrounding villages on their own. One may, however, argue that preparation of resettlement site took quite a long time and people could not afford to wait for it and got themselves rehabilitated wherever they could find some place. Once resettled, they did not want to move again. It would have been a better deal if they got the opportunity to resettle at the first instance. In case of NGO involvement with the project one may point out that all these NGOs are participating in the project at the implementation level only. They did not demand participation in project planning and designing. NGO policy advocacy role in favour of the PAPs, which has been seen in many parts of the world, is conspicuously absent in the Jamuna Bridge Project. There is, however, no doubt, that NGO participation in the project has improved the quality of the implementation phase of the project significantly. The resettlement action plan of the Jamuna Bridge Project is of immense importance, as it is the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Before this there existed no legal framework for this kind of activities. There is every likelihood that this plan will have a major influence in developing strategies for future development projects. Therefore, it is quite pertinent that there should be independent evaluation of various policy measures under the plan and its implementation.

But a spokesman for Olympics minister Michael Knight said there was no need for such a meeting because board members had been kept fully informed of developments. Sydney businessman John Valder, who represents Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on the games organising committee, said the storm that broke out last week over Sydney's 1993 bid could threaten the funding and conduct of the 2000 Games. \"The principal concern of people like myself is that we have the wherewithal to stage the Games in the way we aim to do so, and these things can jeopardise that,\" Valder told Reuters. He said he was unaware of the details of how the bid was won but his main concern was how the furore would affect fund raising. \"Fairly drastic developments have taken place which could jeopardise the whole funding of the Olympic Games and the conduct of the Games. \"This certainly is a pretty serious situation,\" Valder said, adding that significant funds were yet to be raised for the games, through both sponsorship and ticket sales. Sydney currently faces a shortfall of about 220 million (US 140 million) in its Games funding. Valder said he had formally asked Olympics minister Knight to call the board together urgently. I was surprised to find they hadn't had a meeting (already)\". The committee's board was not due to meet until February 18. John Cates Australia's Olympic committee president said last week he had arranged sports funding totalling 1.2 million for 11 African countries in the weeks before Sydney won the 1993 bidding race by just two votes from Beijing. On the eve of the vote Cates promised international Olympic Committee (IOC) delegates from Kenya and Uganda a total of 35,000 each to sponsor sports projects. The revelations drew Sydney into the biggest scandal to his the Olympic movement in its 105 year history. The Australian Olympic Committee took the calculated risk of revealing its bid tactics just as the IOC was completing an inquiry into bribery allegations surrounding Salt Lake City's successful bid to host the 2002 Winter Olympics. Australian officials have said the Sydney payments were all made though national Olympic committees to fund sports projects - unlike Salt Lake City's bid where IOC delegates were accused of taking 600,000 worth of goods and services. The IOC on Sunday reaffirmed Sydney would be staging the 2000 Games and Olympics chief Juan Antonio Samaranch has said he does not think Sydney did anything wrong.

{"title": "Is This Law Needed?", "body": "AGAIN the apparition of a harsh law is back. Towards the fag-end of its tenure the AL government has felt the need for a draconian law just as the predecessor BNP government had fallen for, close to the half-way point of its term in 1992. With the Cabinet deciding to place the controversial public Safety Bill (Special Provision) in the Jatiya Sangsad envisaging summary trial for certain specified criminal offences through special tribunals the spectre of a strong-arm tactic has been raised by the government, needlessly we think. Inexorably, when in the government the AL is showing that it cannot do without a 'tough' law but when in the opposition the same party had torn asunder with some incisive logic the Suppression of Terrorist Offences Act passed during the BNP rule. The AL had argued then that it was an unconstitutional measure and an onslaught on human rights which was also likely to be abused by the police, if not by the then incumbent PM or the home ministry etc. etc. The supreme irony is that the same logic can now be turned around and used against the AL government, perhaps with a greater vehemence because of the fact that the AL has refused to learn any lesson from the abandonment of the law by the BNP government earlier on. Initially enacted for two years, it was subsequently allowed to fall in disuse without any renewal, albeit as a result of public outcry. But in the present case, the AL government does not even seem keen on a time-bound duration legislate, which makes it look even worse. When there is a long-pending clamour for the removal of the diabolic Special Powers Act itself from the statute book what is so compelling now about a special act of parliament to deal with crimes when laws do exist to tackle them anyhow? Couldn't those, with certain modifications, prove effective? If only we had the will to enforce the existing legal provisions against crimes, if we had taken due care in preparing the prosecution and if we had landed with a rate of conviction that was next to nothing before the number of arrests made and publicised, then surely we wouldn't have any need for such a draconian law. The timing of the bill can be suspect with the opposition agitation mounting and the elections approaching, to say nothing of its overall thrust. If the government presses on with it, then our suggestion will be that before its adoption let the draft bill be circulated to elicit public opinion on it.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/is-this-law-needed", "date": "2000-01-19T00:01:34+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 428},

{"title": "MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE", "body": "A train is set on fire by Jamaat activists during a hartal in early March. Photo: Star File How have we landed in such an imbroglio? There is a vacuum in the legal system centring the next general election, and according to the Constitution, the 10th parliamentary election is supposed to be held anytime in between October 27 to January 24 next year. It means that we have only six full months ahead of the battle of the ballots. And after six months, the Election Commission will ring the bell by officially kicking off the process of holding the polls through which people will determine the fate of the political parties and the politicians. The five-year-long wait for the opposition parties to go to power by obtaining people's verdict is now close to an end. Streets of fire. Photo: Anurup Kanti Das Therefore, major political parties like the ruling Awami League and BNP are supposed to start their election work, including carrying out a field survey to pick competent candidates, to find out their weaknesses, to assess people's expectations and to conduct research to prepare an election manifesto to woo the voters. But what does reality say? Is the country ready for the battle of the next parliamentary election? Or is the country heading towards a grave political crisis centring the election? For the People? Instead of taking preparations for the electoral battle, both the ruling Awami League-led alliance and BNP-led opposition parties are taking preparations to face each other in a fatal fight on the streets. The underlying reason for the fight between them is nothing but to grab power. People's welfare is not that important, rather their lives and properties are going to be put at stake. How are they taking the preparations to retain power or to return to it? Begum Khaleda Zia wants to oust the government from power. Photo: Amran Hossain In a whimsical move, the AL-led government has abolished the caretaker government in June 2011 by amending the constitution, long before the 10th parliamentary election, unsettling the country's political situation. The cancellation of the election time caretaker government, which was an outcome of violent street agitations by the AL and other opposition parties in 1996, has paved the way for the ruling AL to remain in office during the next parliamentary election. Not only that, the latest constitutional amendment has made it possible for present MPs to remain in office when they will seek re-election in the next polls. It doesn't take a political scientist to understand that if a partisan government remains in office during the polls it may get some extra mileage by manipulating the polls in its favour. It has happened in the past. People's perception is very clear about this. Therefore, the ruling AL's political strategy to remain in office during the upcoming battle of ballots will not work. The sooner it reassesses its strategy, the better for the party. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina - in no mood for compromise. Photo: Star File However, there is no sign in the government and the ruling AL to reassess its political strategy. Rather, all signs suggest that the party is gradually engaging themselves in a fight with the BNP-led opposition alliance on the streets in the name of resisting the opposition's ongoing movement. This strategy to counter the opposition alliance will finally benefit the latter as the situation will become even more volatile. And a volatile political situation always favours the opposition parties, not the government and the ruling party. The government policymakers and the ruling party leaders have also been making another blunder of mixing up the issue of the trial of war criminals with other political issues. They have been using it as a shield, which is quite dangerous. Holding trial of war criminals is not the AL's pet project. It is a demand of the people. And unfortunately, the excessive use of the shield has already done much damage to the issue. So, the government policymakers and the ruling AL leaders should immediately reassess this strategy to keep the trial free from further political controversy. All signs of heightened political violence are there. Photo: Rashed Shumon Readying themselves for battle. Photo: Star File The government's strategy has made it clear to the main opposition BNP that the latter's demand for reintroduction of the election time non-partisan caretaker government will not be accepted by the government. And if a caretaker government is not installed, the BNP's chances to win the next parliamentary polls stand very slim. There is no other alternative to the BNP, but to launch a movement for an election time non-partisan government to return to power. Therefore, the BNP in March announced the one-point movement to topple the government as a means to meet its demand. The one-point movement will not be automatically accepted. For this, the BNP feels it has to stage violent street agitations, something similar to what the AL did in 1996 and at the end of 2006 and in early 2007. Enforcing gentle and peaceful political agitation programmes will not yield the results desired, the party high command might think. So it needs to gear up militant street agitations to make the situation more volatile. And for the violent agitations, BNP needs Jamaat and Shibir who have unleashed mayhem in parts of the country for some days since February 28. So, the BNP has minimised its gap with Jamaat and decided to enforce all agitation programmes jointly under the banner of the 18-party alliance. The political strategy is clear. BNP needs Jamaat to wage vigorous street agitations against the AL-led government while Jamaat needs BNP's banner to unleash terror to destabilise the situation to foil the trial of war criminals and to get Jamaat's top leaders freed. Therefore, their goal is the same--ousting the government. And some BNP policymakers have also acknowledged that only the ouster of the government will fulfil all the parties' demands. Will the police be able to tackle the violence ahead? Photo: Star File The BNP has planned to make the April a turning point for its one-point movement to overthrow the government by enforcing more frequent hartals and road blockade. They even may announce the 'march towards Dhaka' programme, urging its leaders and workers to come to the capital and agitate in the city to bring the capital to a standstill. All the opposition's programmes will be aimed at creating a situation which will make the government unable to function properly. The acute political unrest will benefit the opposition. A number of senior BNP leaders have earlier told this correspondent that they have planned to do what the present AL did in 1996 and at the end of 2006, and also early January 2007 against the then BNP-led government and the Iajuddin Ahmed-led caretaker government. On both occasions, the AL had waged violent street agitations by enforcing dozens of hartals, road blockade and siege, making the then governments unable to keep the situation under control. Army Saves the Day? In the third world countries where democracy is fragile, armed forces, particularly the army, play a crucial role in shaping political developments. The political forces also take into consideration the role of the army, the most organised and disciplined force in the country. When the country plunges into a political crisis, the army intervenes to save the day. But sometimes, politicians also take the strategy to use the army for their political purpose. It is interesting to see how both Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her archrival Khaleda Zia have been urging the army to play a 'role to save the country's democracy'. Broken bricks, raging flames and youths with lethal weapons - a common scene in the streets these days.Photo: Star File Addressing the Generals Conference of Bangladesh Army at Dhaka Cantonment on February 3 this year, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina directed the senior army officials to resist any anti-democratic and anti-constitutional activity for the continuation of the country's development. “Stay alert so that no vested quarter can disrupt the country's forward march riding over the army's back. I hope you'll resist any anti-democratic and anti-constitutional activity with your all-out strength,” said, Hasina, who also holds the defence portfolio. Hasina's remark was unprecedented. It was also surprising to many, how an elected Prime Minister could speak this way. By making such remarks didn't she invite the army to play a role in the country's politics? Her remarks might not have been warmly welcomed by the army which has now become more professional than before. But being a disciplined force, it was not possible for them to express their views. Some former senior army officers however have questioned the necessity of the premier's remarks. After more than one and a half months, Hasina's archrival BNP chief Khaleda Zia has gone one step further. Addressing a roadside party rally at Bogra on March 24, the opposition leader said the army would not play the role of “a silent spectator while people are getting killed” and that it would “play its role in due time”. She said members of the armed forces would not be picked for peacekeeping missions if there was unrest in Bangladesh. “But if there was no peace in Bangladesh, foreigners would then say that the army is not capable of maintaining peace in other countries.” Fear and intimidation keep the streets during hartals. Photo: Star File She further said, “The army is a part of our country and therefore it has responsibilities towards it.” Some former senior army officials and eminent citizens have expressed surprise over the BNP chief's comment and said that the comment was “tantamount to provocation.” History will Teach us Nothing The comments made by Hasina and Khaleda have made it clear that both the leaders want to see some role of army in \"protecting democracy\". Their remarks have also fuelled public speculation over a probable role of the army in tackling the current political unrest. Will the army play a role like the way it did in 2007? The way the political situation is developing, diminishing the prospect of any amicable solution before the upcoming parliamentary polls, it may soon reach a dead end. If it happens, where will it lead us? Professor Nurul Islam, a leading development economist and former teacher of the Dhaka University, in his article titled \"Reflections on Democracy and Development in Bangladesh,\" explains why the possibility of army takeover is very slim. Prof Nurul Islam, who is the founding director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, writes, \"It is frequently suggested that risks of political intervention by the army in Bangladesh have declined due to several factors: (1) there has been a significant change in the international climate, in the aftermath of the Cold War, against the political role of the army and in favour of political freedom and democracy; (2) for a heavily aid-dependent country like Bangladesh, the likelihood of an adverse external reaction to any military takeover serves as a restraining factor; (3) years of experience have convinced the army that to solve the development problems of Bangladesh is a very heavy responsibility that is difficult to fulfil; (4) it is far better to enjoy all the comfort and financial privileges far above the civilian level without any responsibility of running the country; and (5) the participation in the recent UN peace keeping missions has given it an additional resource and a measure of prestige and status at home and abroad.\" Prof Islam's analysis proved right in January 2007 when the army did not take over amid a grave political turmoil, rather they installed a caretaker government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed. General Moyeen U Ahmed, who was army chief during the crisis, has also echoed Prof Islam's views. General Moyeen in his book titled: \"In dream for peace: Reminisces of Age\" has described the army's thoughts during the critical times on the eve of the declaration of the state of emergency on January 11, 2007. The former general writes about some alternatives the army was considering at that time. According to General Moyeen's accounts, the army found three ways through a meeting with the then President and Chief Adviser to the caretaker government, Iajuddin Ahmed. One was to hold the parliamentary election [which was scheduled on January 22, 2007], although the election would inevitably be questioned as all the parties would not participate in it. In that case, the country would have to go through an unimaginable conflict. The army would be put against the people if it followed the state's order to hold the election. There was the risk of sending back the Bangladesh army from the UN peace keeping mission for assisting a non-credible election. Refusal to meet each other halfway has resulted in a total deadlock. Photo: Star File The second option was declaring martial law and holding an election at a convenient time. But the army too was against the enforcement of martial law as it does not have any acceptability in the world. Besides, the country would be regressing as a consequence of martial law. The last option was to declare a state of emergency under the constitution to restore democracy by holding parliamentary elections as soon as possible subject to the improvement of the law and order situation. \"Considering all aspects, [we] submitted arguments for declaration of the state of emergency,\" General Moyeen writes. And finally the then President Iajuddin Ahmed declared a state of emergency on January 11, 2007. It was a solution to the political crisis that plagued the nation around seven years ago. So, what will happen this time? Will the AL-led government go for holding a one-sided election the way the past BNP-led government did on February 15, 1996? But holding stage managed polls may spark more street violence as the BNP-led opposition alliance will in no way allow the government to do this so easily. They will deploy their army of workers to resist the polls, carrying out violent street agitations. If more street violence erupts, will the country witness a repetition of the political impasse that took place in January 2007? Upon the advice of the BNP, the Iajuddin-led caretaker government moved to hold one-sided elections, but it could not succeed in the face of violent street agitations by AL-led opposition parties. Finally the declaration of the state of emergency on January 11, 2007 had saved the country from sliding into further chaos. Given the prevailing political situation, it can be said with certainty that if things spiral out of control, a big political crisis awaits the country.

Eight passengers, belonging to a family of Bangladeshis coming from UK, received the first payment of 10,000 Pounds earlier this week, according to Biman sources yesterday. The rest of the 84 passengers who survived the crash-landing along with four crew, have been advised by the airline to immediately get in touch with it to file insurance claims. The Lloyds began the payment after two of its assessors visited the site of crash-landing and filed their report to the head office in London last week. The F-28 aircraft had been insured for six million dollars by the Sadharan Bima Corporation with the Lloyds. The aircraft is beyond salvage, Biman sources said. The sources expressed their optimism that with the start of payment to the passengers, Biman's insurance claim for the aircraft would be expedited. The Biman is hoping to streamline its beleagured domestic service, now limping with only one aircraft, a propeller-driven ATP, by taking lease of an aircraft from the Australian National Airlines. Two officials from the Australian Airlines are expected to arrive Dhaka today to finalise details with Biman officials to dry-lease one of their F-28 aircraft, similar to the damaged aircraft. Biman sources said they are keen on procuring an aircraft for its domestic service because the damaged F-28's twin, now in Amsterdam for D-check, will not be available for at least six weeks. The D-check will cost 0.7 million US dollars. They said per hour operational cost of the F-28 to be taken on dry-lease will be less than that of its own F-28. The airline operated four domestic flights yesterday, cancelling only one due to fog. With the fog hanging on, it has been forced to reschedule a number of its international flights today which will have a cascading effect on tomorrow's schedule. Biman officials said its London flight will leave Dhaka at 3:45 am, Calcutta flight at 4:30 pm, Karachi at 12:30 pm, Kuala Lumpur at 10:30 pm, Tokyo at 10 pm, Riyadh at 8:45 am, Kathmandu at 11 am, Bombay-Dubai-Chittagong and Dhaka at 1 pm today.

{"title": "Rainer the richer", "body": "Rainer Schuettler's routine five-week off-season preparation paid big dividends on Wednesday when he overpowered Argentine 10th seed David Nalbandian to reach his first Grand Slam tennis semi-final at the Australian Open. The German 31st seed swarmed over last year's Wimbledon finalist with his superior court coverage, fitness and groundstrokes to pull off a merited 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 win in 2hr 18min on Rod Laver Arena. Schuettler's reward was his first Grand Slam semifinal on Friday against either Moroccan 18th seed Younes El Aynaoui or American ninth seed Andy Roddick. El Aynaoui and Roddick play later Wednesday. \"Of course, I'm surprised, but I have so far played a pretty good tournament and I deserve to be in the semi-final,\" Schuettler said. Schuettler's five weeks slaving away under a Taekwondo fitness coach had him in superb physical condition when he arrived in Australia early in the new year. He reached the quarterfinals in Madras and semi-finals in Sydney before embarking on his unbeaten run to the Open semi-final. Nalbandian looked a tired and beaten man as 26-year-old Schuettler roared through the final set without losing a game in 32 minutes. \"I played pretty good in the third set and in the fourth it was mentally tough for him because I got the early break,\" said Schuettler. Schuettler, inspired as a nine-year-old by the Wimbledon exploits of German tennis great Boris Becker, has steadily worked his way through the rankings from 111 at the end of 1998 to 33 last year and is rated second in Germany behind Tommy Haas. \"I start preparing for the new season at the end of November, so I like to have five weeks every year to work really hard with a fitness coach,\" he said. \"Over the last two years I've been doing something a little different with a Taekwondo teacher, so I practice a lot and that's why I'm always fit at the beginning of the year.\" Schuettler was far more consistent on the bigger points than lethargic Nalbandian, who was suffering the lingering effects of his five-set fight with Roger Federer in the previous round. Nalbandian levelled at a set-all, but he was swamped by the eager German in the third and fourth sets and lost his last five service games. Schuettler is the fifth German man to reach the semi-finals at the Australian Open in the post-1969 Open era. The others were Karl Meiler (1973), Boris Becker (1991 and 1996), Michael Stich (1993) and Haas (1999 and 2002). Schuettler will be aided in his coming semi-final by the comparative short time he has been on court. He has reserves of unspent energy having been on court for just seven hours 53 minutes to reach the last four, but he received a third round walkover when Marat Safin withdrew with a wrist injury. It was dismal ending for what had been a promising 10 days for Nalbandian. Nalbandian, who made the tennis world sit up when he made last year's Wimbledon final against Australian world number one Lleyton Hewitt, said the Federer win had taken its toll. \"I was a little tired from the match the other day,\" he said. \"I was trying to take my chances at the beginning of the third set, but I didn't really play well there.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/rainer-the-richer", "date": "2003-01-23T00:00:33+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 547},
{"title": "Poor aman signals cruel time ahead", "body": "January and February could prove the cruellest months for the urban and rural poor because of the evolving food scenario. Indications are there that aman is headed for a bad harvest, prompting high prices in the short term and foodgrain imports to well overshoot the target. As a result, growth will be curtailed. A bad wheat season and high international prices will only compound the woes. The picture will be clearer in a week when harvest result becomes available. Across the north and in some areas in the south, farmers have already reported poor harvest. Their spirit nonetheless remains high, with prices keeping buoyant belying a normal trend of lowest prices between end-December and end-January. Overall, the market has shown an abnormal upswing on the back of the aman dip this year. Rice prices kept creeping up from mid-December and increased marginally even in end-December. The foodgrain production target this year was set at 28 million tonnes, six per cent up from last year's 25.9 million tonnes. Aman target was set at 11.46 million tonnes as against last year's 10.73 million tonnes and 11.25 million tonnes of the year before. And experts feel both targets were a bit ambitious as is now being proven. Wholesalers and millers in the north are reporting a slow supply of paddy and rice, resulting in the price increase. \"It is possible that supply has slowed down due to various reasons including late harvesting because of Ramadan,\" said Dr Sajjad Zohir, a senior research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). \"But there are several reasons to argue otherwise.\" Between November and mid-December, the government went for open market sales (OMS) of rice at Tk 11, a rate substantially lower than the purchase price. \"This had a crowding-in effect resulting in slow off-take from the private stock. And as a result, rice price should have dropped even more, which did not happen. This is an indication that aman production has been low this year,\" said Dr Sajjad. The aman shortfall would also mean a dent in the growth. The OMS over, prices increased more rapidly and, during December 29 to December 31, the national average was Tk 12.63 per kilogram. On the other hand, over 80 per cent of the projected private import has been realised within the first five and a half months, once again confirming the production shortfall. This year's target for private sector import is one million tonnes and already 800,000 tonnes have been brought in. More will come during the February-March period, which is expected to push up the total import figure to around 1.5 million tonnes. Meantime, the government began procurement from yesterday with the stock down to 700,000 tonnes from one million tonnes. The government deems a stock of 850,000 tonnes as a satisfactory security level. The procurement might push the prices further up. On the other hand, the finance ministry's rigid position on converting food distribution in kind to cash in the food for work (FFW) programme would also have some bearing on the future market price. Already, 200,000 tonnes of foodgrain have been reduced from the FFW within the broad policy framework of switching over from kind to cash. Wheat production is also looking down this year and wheat price in the international market is also quite high. The landed price is close to Tk 12.5 per kg, which is quite high. Moreover, because of a tightened border, flow from India would also be slow. These factors together would lead to a price-hike in the short term and the rural poor, who would be paid in cash instead of food, would be hit hard. The urban poor and the labourers would also feel the heat. On the flip side, the farmers would benefit from higher prices of produces and be encouraged to use proper inputs. Aman rice varieties Swarna and BR-11 are now selling at Tk 1,150 and Tk 1,100 respectively per 84-kilogram sack on local markets. Only ten days back, the same varieties were sold at Tk 1,100 and Tk 1,050 respectively, according to market sources. In terms of maunds, aman paddy is selling at around Tk 330, which was below Tk 300 a week ago. Farmers blame the funky weather - too much rain first and too little thereon - for the poor harvest this year. And local traders fear that prices might go up a little more because of 'poor supply' and because of the off season between January and mid-March. \"Growers' presence in the markets is much lower this year and the foggy weather has also slowed down the rice drying process,\" Abdur Rashid, a rice trader in Rajshahi's Shaheb Bazar area, said. \"We could not supply sufficient rice to our clients from different parts of the country including Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Barisal and Jessore.\" The situation is the same throughout Natore, Bogra, Dinajpur and Rangpur. Daud Ali, a 65-year-old farmer of Paramandapur, cultivated aman (BR-11 variety) on 10 bighas and returned eight maunds per bigha this year against a standard of 10 maunds. Joynal, Faruk, Abdul Awal, Muntaj and Abdur Rahim Mandal of Paramandapur and Amnura villages witnessed similar shortfall. Arman Ali, a marginal farmer of Paramandapur who cultivated aman paddy on 10 bighas, said scarcity of water and untimely rainfall hindered output. In Berabari of Mohonpur, aman rice grower Abdur Rashid got an average production of six maunds from seven bighas. Rezaul Karim, deputy director of the Agriculture Extension Department (AED) in Rajshahi, hinted at a production shortfall of about ten per cent in the district. \"I will not claim this year's production as a good one but it will be satisfactory as it was last year despite the fact that there was no reasonable causes for the poor production and there was no remarkable incidents of natural calamities and attack of insects\", Karim said. He, however, blamed some of the areas in Rajshahi where there is the irrigation facilities are poor and the growers who planted seedlings in late. The high paddy and rice prices, he said, would encourage Boro cultivation on more areas in the upcoming season. And so, the AED has marked out 57,100 hectares for Boro cultivation villages in the upcoming season. Rezaul expects the targeted area to cross the 60,000-hectare mark eventually. In the immediate-past Boro season, 2.09 lakh metric tonnes of rice was produced from 55,265 hectares in Rajshahi. Poor aman harvest in certain areas will not affect the gross production figures of the district, Rezaul said. \"Rajshahi has fared better in aman production than other districts in the northern region.\" At least 122,640 tonnes of rice and 70,000 tonnes of paddy are expected to be collected at a rate of Tk 1,280 per quintal of rice and Tk 840 per quintal of paddy from 16 northern districts.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/poor-aman-signals-cruel-time-ahead", "date": "2003-01-02T00:00:40+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1135},
{"title": "Violence against women: Time to renew the old thoughts", "body": "Humanity haunts human beings when humane humbleness is lost. Likewise, woman's right haunts woman when female entity is shattered. In compliance with other countries of the world, 'The International Women's Day' has been observed routinely in our country with firm pledge and commitment to uphold the rights of women. But even after 42 years from independence, can we unequivocally raise our voice claiming and ensuring equal right and dignified status of women in our society? Perhaps not, rather violence and inhuman treatment against women has become a serious threat to overall development and enlightenment of the country. Like other South-Asian countries, violence against women has become a very common phenomenon in our country even from the women's perspective. Where the standard of living is booming, the price of daily commodities is hiking, the occurrence of terrorism and crime is on the rise, nepotism and corruption is increasing; does it sound alarming if aggression against women normally grows high? We, the people of Bangladesh, do feel the necessity of establishing women's rightful status and in consequence of this contemplation, several campaigns and initiatives concentrating on rights of women are launched from time to time by both government and non-government organizations including human rights groups and women activist groups. But it cannot be said that the condition of women has been improved to a great extent comparing to our heart-felt initiatives and expectations. Where lies the problem underneath? I think, time has come to have a look at the issue from different dimensions. As for instance, in many cases of violence it was previously believed that framing a strong and harsh legislation would be a prolific solution whereas, it has already been proved that raising massive awareness against such crime or violence is more effective while combating it. “Reducing is far easier than eradicating”- should be our most probable approach. In Bangladesh, women become susceptible to different forms of violence like sexual harassment, sexual assault including rape, murder and grievous hurt, domestic violence, dowry related violence, acid throwing, trafficking, kidnapping and abduction, illegal fatwa and illegal arbitration, minority violence, wage discrimination and social discrimination, health and nutritional deficiency etc. According to a report of 'Odhikar' (A Human Rights Organization), last year (i.e. in 2012), about 760 women including children were raped of which 188 were gang raped while 69 were killed after rape. A total of 479 girls and women were victims of sexual harassment among which 18 committed suicide, three were stabbed to death, 24 were injured, 15 were assaulted, 69 were victims of attempted rape and 350 were sexually harassed in various ways. 822 females were subjected to dowry related violence of which four were minor brides, 273 were killed because of dowry, 535 were ill-treated in various other ways and 14 committed suicide over dowry demands. 78 women became victims of acid violence of which 20 were young girls. About nine women were subjected to violence by whipping, social isolation etc. in the name of illegal fatwa. Some women rights organizations like Bangladesh Mohila Parishad, Karmojibi Nari, Bangladesh Adivasi Nari Network, Bangladesh Nari Pragati Sangha etc. express their deep concerns on the fact that the number of unfortunate and unwanted deaths of women is increasing day by day. According to a press briefing in the Dhaka Reporter's Unity, on an average, five national minority women suffer several types of violence per month. Police data shows that 1,09,621 complaints of various forms of violence against women were lodged during the 2010-2012 (up to August) period. Of these, 18,484 complaints were taken into cognizance, but only 6,875 cases were deemed 'genuine' and 'fit' for further proceedings. According to Health Ministry sources: 70% of women suffer from nutritional deficiency, 67% of pregnant women do not receive antenatal care and 14% of pregnant women's death are associated with injury and violence. But the commitment of the Bangladesh State does not march with the above promises. 'Equality before the Law' and 'No discrimination to women' is constitutionally guaranteed. Women are well represented politically. There is an increase amount of economic opportunities for women that shows a trend towards women empowerment. A number of steps have already been taken to improve the situation of women. Apart from 'The Penal Code, 1860', we have many other Laws that have been enacted to provide punishment to the offenders and protect women from violent acts. We have 'The Prevention of Repression against Women and Children (Amendment) Act, 2003', 'The National Human Rights Commission Act, 2009', 'The Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2010', 'The Guidelines of the High Court Division passed in 2009' (The High Court Bench directed the government to make a law on the basis of its guidelines; until that happened, its guidelines would enjoy the status of Law), 'The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1980', 'The Domestic Violence (Prevention & Protection) Act, 2010', 'The Pornography Control Act, 2011', 'Human Trafficking Deterrence and Suppression Act, 2012'. Besides, Bangladesh is also a signatory to many International Conventions designed to protect women and their rights. Despite all these, women's rights fail to come out from the circle of failure and violence against women is running at a pace. Reconsiderable factors: issues that need to take into consideration on priority basis regarding violence against women in Bangladesh The members of the Parliament and framers of legislation should put utmost emphasis on the above issues for the purpose of initiating any endeavour in the process of protecting womenfolk from any violence and thus ensuring their rightful status. Positive change of the outlook of men towards women and showing profound respect to them can bear significant improvement in this respect. For the accomplishment of this objective, massive protest by both print and electronic media campaign should be ensured in order to create awareness among mass people. Judicial activism should be exercised more and legal aid activities must be enhanced so that destitute victims can easily have access to justice. Otherwise, amendment of legislation, three-tier strategies, all government and non-government policies will carry zero outcome. As a result, this gender based violence will make fun of our judicial system. It is desirable that the organs of the government, the human rights organizations, other benevolent organizations and the civil society must be true and sincere to their commitment required for curbing the incumbent violence. Finally, we need to determine what should be the stand of us common people towards violators and miscreants? “Zero tolerance towards violence against women.” The writer is an Assistant Professor, Faculty of Law, Premier University, Chittagong, Bangladesh.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/violence-against-women-time-to-renew-the-old-thoughts", "date": "2013-03-16T00:00:42+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1087},

Crompton was giving evidence to a special hearing of the Pakistan judicial commission which is investigating allegations of bribery and match fixing by Pakistan players. Crompton read a prepared statement to the commission, detailing how the ACB learned in early 1995 that the two Australians had taken money the previous year from an Indian bookmaker during a tournament in Sri Lanka. Warne and Waugh were fined by the ACB, but the matter was not made public until last month. Later, under cross-examination by Pakistan Cricket Board legal advisers, Crompton said the Board did not make the fines public because of its policy. \"I deny in the strongest terms there was a cover-up,\" he said. \"The discipline of players for matters other than those in the public arena are private and that procedure was followed.\" Warne and Waugh testified to the commission Friday and strenuously denied they had been involved in bribery or match fixing. They said they had only provided the mystery bookmaker, known only as John, with match and pitch information. The commission decided to visit Australia after the revelations about Waugh and Warne, who had previously accused Pakistan batsman Salim Malik of offering them money to play badly during Australia's 1994 tour of Pakistan. The other Australian player who had made accusations against Malik, retired spinner Tim May, also testified Saturday to the commission. The commission will return to Pakistan on Sunday and sit again on January 16, with its findings expected by the end of the month. May said that Malik had invited Warne to his hotel room the night before the last day of the first Test between the two countries in 1994, which Pakistan won. May said Warne returned after spending about 10 minutes with Malik and said he had offered Warne and May 200,000 dollar each if they were prepared to play badly. Reading from the affidavit he originally gave to the ACB in 1995, May said Warne was clearly shocked when he returned to the hotel room. \"He said 'you're not going to believe this' and told me he and mark Waugh had been offered 200,000 dollars each,\" said May. \"I asked Shane if he had told The Rat (the nickname the Australian team gave to Malik) to get...\" \"I have never talked to Malik about the issue.\" May also recounted how the Australians learned later in the tour that Mark Waugh had also allegedly been approached by Malik with another offer of 200,000 dollars for Australian players to perfer badly in a one-day match.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/alan-claims-innocence", "date": "1999-01-10T00:00:47+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 453},

But the trend of this sector in recent years is not encouraging which is manifested by the gradual declining of crop production during the first half of the present decade. Different factors are responsible for this negative trend which may require a comprehensive study to find out. Although 'self sufficiency in food' is the common aim of all the Five-Year Plans of the government yet still the target remains unachieved. Many development projects with the main objective of increasing agricultural production, farm incomes and employment opportunities have been taken in this sector and most of the projects are of flood control, drainage and irrigation (FCD&I) type. Various types of interventions like embankment, canal digging, river dredging, sluice gate, fish pass, boat pass etc. are common in most of the FCD projects. Each year a major part of our development budget is spent on implementing these projects. But the lesson learned from the past is very frustrating except the case of minor irrigation schemes. Even the FAP (Flood Action Plan) studies of recent years which introduced many innovative ideas and technological developments to make the projects environmentally sound and sustainable can be accredited for the findings that helped the projects to be more sound but failed to remove the existing bottlenecks still threatening their sustainability. This is the general view regarding most of the FCD projects and the recent FAP studies as well. Although adequate corrective measures have been proposed in FAP studies against the lacking of the past but all the studies have been found defective at least in one crucial point which may not be conducive for the proposed projects to be sustainable. Operation and maintenance (O&M) stage is the most crucial part of a water resources development project. After the successful implementation of any FCD project the smooth operation and maintenance play a key role in the sustainability of that project. The O&M must be self-sustaining and for this, among other factors like proper institutional and organizational set-up, the issue of cost-recovery has become a prime concern. This is a long-standing bottleneck in the planning and decision making process of the projects. Unless it is prudently addressed the benefits envisaged cannot be realized. Now it is realized that traditional O&M works will never bring the targeted achievement of the project. The reason generally quoted by the organization concerned (BWDB) for the poor O&M status is the non-availability of the required funds. In some cases, annual O&M budget allocation to BWDB are used mainly for paying staff salaries. Breaching of embankment, silting-up of drainage canal, non-functioning of sluice gate, etc. are the very real and common features of these projects. Due to lack of proper operation and maintenance the system so built suffers throughout its life-time and in the end the investments are lost. The capital expenditure incurred to build the project becomes meaningful only if the beneficiaries take over O&M responsibilities. The government, appreciating the importance of cost recovery for project sustainability, has initiated number of studies through its relevant agencies to identify suitable mechanisms for achieving it. All the efforts to devise a self-sustaining mechanism through which fund can be created for smooth operation and maintenance of the project have failed. The main hindrances identified in O&M cost recovery are the general unwillingness of the users to pay and non-deposition of the amount collected by the middlemen to BWDB. A new suggestion about O&M cost recovery has been made in a very recent study report of an FCD type project. According to the suggestion, a flat rate land improvement tax on all holdings within the project area is to be imposed and the Union Parishad will be empowered to assess and collect that tax with necessary cooperation and help from the revenue Tahsil offices. The ministry concerned seems to be satisfied with this suggestion. The suggestion to impose a flat rate land improvement tax on all holdings within the sub-project area is workable but not justifiable on the ground that the impact on different lands due to the project will definitely not be flat or be of same degree. Therefore, benefit derived by different land holders will be different within the project or SPs area. The suggestion of flat rate tax is very likely to cause serious social repercussion. So it is only justifiable to collect tax from the beneficiaries proportionate to the benefit they derive due to the project intervention. Secondly, the suggestion made in the report regarding the mode of cost-recovery is not workable, therefore, cannot be relied on for sustainability. The reason is that the Union Parishad is not an efficient body specially for tax collection. It has some goodwill in the reconciliation of social disputes which can be used in the settlement of conflicts arising during any stage of project implementation or beyond but this local body is very inefficient in tax realisation exercise which is manifested by the precarious condition of their own tax collection. Long time arrear is a common phenomenon for all UPs of the country; even many of their own taxes remain unrealized for good. Therefore, they cannot be entrusted or empowered to collect those project related taxes. As the beneficiaries get their benefits in indirect way so it will be judicious to recover the cost in an indirect way. If tax is collected in an indirect method it will be most sound, sustainable and would not create any social unrest. This idea is not a new or unprecedented one, it is practiced in other sectors of the government. SUGGESTION: Instead of tax collection directly from the beneficiaries an arrangement is to be made so that the fund necessary for the O&M of the project, after its implementation phase, will be provided from the Hat/Bazar leasing fund of the respective Thana Parishad (TP). Water Management Committee (WMC) of the project or SPs will prepare a need based budget and submit it to the respective TP. Thana Parishad will allocate the amount from their leasing fund. For this additional allocation TP will increase the rate of tax (khazna) at certain percentage on listed commodities/products impacted positively due to the project interventions. The decision of increased rate of tax will be informed to the prospective bidder prior to the bidding for leasing out of Hat/Bazar within the project or SP areas. Consequently bidding will be higher and the TP will get additional money required for such new allocation. The Lessees, the most efficient agents of tax collection will collect tax with their own mechanism, manpower and traditional practice. This mechanism of tax collection will be more proportionate to the benefit derived by the beneficiaries because most of the benefit due to the FCD project will result in higher agricultural production. If the tax is imposed on the products it will be justifiable on proportional ground. An additional tax for project with the existing tax (khazna) on these products in Hat/Bazar will not be difficult to realise by the lessees. This is the system of fund procurement by which collection cost can be totally avoided, regular cash inflow will be ensured, the long-standing problem of project operation and maintenance due to the lack of required fund would be solved and in turn, sustainability will prevail. If the suggestion is taken into account a study in this respect will be needed and if the study result shows that the suggestion made is workable, most sound and sustainable, a recommendation should be made and put forward to the government for approval backed by necessary legal framework.

{"title": "Water project to mitigate arsenic poison may get new term", "body": "The Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP) may be extended for another three years, officials said yesterday. The World Bank (WB) credit for the US$ 44 million project is closing on June 30. Earlier, it was extended for nine months after its expiry in September 2002. A team of experts from the WB headquarters in Washington, US, left the city last week after examining different aspects of the four-year project. Officials said a three-member team of the WB reviewed recent progress of the project and expressed satisfaction but the officials are still unhappy with the pace of the project, which is supposed to provide alternative source of safe drinking water to arsenic affected areas. However, mitigation activities are still very limited and only a few upazila have been provided with mitigation services. Tubewell testing has been completed in 147 out of 268 upazila. According to sources, the WB and its co-financiers have placed two conditions for lending further credit for the project. The conditions are giving priority to the community demand for safe water options, instead of imposing mitigation services, and leaving financial management to the community leaders themselves. The government has already accepted the first condition but expressed doubts about the community leaders' ability to handle financial resources effectively since the question of accountability will arise. It has proposed that community leaders be trained on handling financial resources and only then given the authority to handle such matters. According to sources, the WB mission held several meetings with the government officials and stakeholders including the secretary of the local government division and the chief engineer of the Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE). The WB experts also visited several arsenic affected areas where BAMWSP intervention is going on. The spots include Brahmanbaria, Narayanganj, Chapainawabganj and Chandpur. The extended BAMWSP project is expected to receive about Tk 80 crore including funds from the government exchequer. Sources also said a separate fund might be allocated for mitigation of arsenic in water supplied in towns. More than 80 million people in 62 districts are now exposed to drinking arsenic contaminated water, mostly from hand-pumped tubewells. Surveys show in many areas naturally occurring arsenic has been found in concentration more than the WHO-approved permissible level of 50 parts per billion (ppb). There are many upazila where all tubewells have been painted red to prohibit people from drinking water from the tubewells.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/water-project-to-mitigate-arsenic-poison-may-get-new-term", "date": "2003-05-28T00:00:06+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 400},
{"title": "Indian SC bans discharging factory waste into Jamuna", "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 24: India's Supreme Court today banned thousands of factories from discharging untreated industrial effluents into the Jamuna River in New Delhi and the neighbouring state of Haryana, reports AFP. Judges BN Kirpal and S Rajendra Babu said river pollution in north India had reached an \"alarming proportion\" and had to be checked. \"We direct every industry in Delhi not to discharge their effluents either into the river or into drains leading to the river which have the effect of polluting the river.\" The judges added that factories in the neighbouring state of Haryana would also have to heed the ban. State-run pollution control boards welcomed the move. \"It is a major victory for us,\" said RC Trivedi of the Central Pollution Control Board, which has been waging a three-year-old campaign to reign in factories polluting the Jamuna, one of the main rivers in north India. \"We supplied the apex court with studies to show the dangerous level of toxins released into the Jamuna every day by some 15,000 to 20,000 factories in Delhi alone,\" said the senior scientist. Trivedi said small to medium size soap and detergent, textile, electroplating, small engineering, and auto factories were the main culprits. \"Tests conducted in our laboratories on water samples collected from the Jamuna show that toxin levels are dangerously high and as a result, the water unsafe for drinking.\" Rajat Banerjee, from the Centre for Science and Environment said the ban would give \"more teeth\" to pollution-control agencies. \"State pollution control boards and the police can now crack down and seal thousands of hole-in-the-wall workshops and factories that are spewing poison into the Jamuna,\" said Banerjee. \"It cannot be business as usual for them. This ban, if seriously implemented, will force businessmen of medium size factories to invest 500,000 rupees (11,820 dollars) to 100,000 rupees in water effluent plants.\" Banerjee, however, said implementation was the tough part. \"It will not be easy to track down small-scale industries who discharge effluents slyly into municipal drains. Their whole business is covert,\" said Banerjee. \"Most of them are not registered establishments so they can close shop for a month or so if there is a crackdown and resurface later when the heat is off.\" India's Water Act, 1974 has been amended several times to give government agencies powers to deal with growing river and ocean pollution.

He was carried by a surrogate mother. He's the baby of a couple in their 40s. \"He's the clone of a baby boy who died at the age of two about 18 months ago. This baby died after an accident. We had the time to preserve cells before his death,\" she said, noting the dead baby had been the couple's child. The so-called cloned baby, who weighted seven pounds (3.2 kilos) at birth and whose name was not released, \"is doing fine as well,\" Boisselier said, noting that a surrogate mother was used because the mother was 41 and her age could make a miscarriage more likely. Clonaid has refused to give evidence for its claims to have produced three human clones, and international scientists have expressed widespread skepticism. Boisselier said the previous two babies -- both girls -- were born to North American and European parents.

{"title": "Innocent acts can be illegal if taken together: Prosecution", "body": "Prosecution lawyers said yesterday the same group of people were behind the curtains of the associate companies that were active in the 1996 share scam that rocked the country's capital market. On the third day of hearing on charge framing against Shinepukur Holdings and its three directors in the court of First Additional Sessions Judge, Dhaka, SEC lawyer Dr M Zahir said, \"Their individuals act may not seem illegal but their combined acts led to the manipulation.\" Only the prosecution lawyers in Shinepukur case argued yesterday as the defence had already made their arguments on the previous day. The hearing continued from 12:00 to 1:30 p.m. yesterday. The accused were in the dock. But the day began with defence arguments on Beximco Pharma, which remained \"part heard\" and will resume January 11. The prosecution lawyers then responded to previous day's defence points. Judge Mia Mohammad Sharif said verdicts of all the three cases regarding Doha Securities, Shinepukur Holdings and Beximco Pharma would be given together. Zahir began his arguments by drawing attention of the court to press reports that quoted defence lawyer Rafiqul Huq as saying, \"People were high on ganja and purchased shares in 1996 and ultimately lost money.\" \"This seems to be the purport of defence argument. It's a typical contemptuous attitude of the rich who make money by exploiting the poor...\" said Zahir. However, he could not finish as Huq from the next row tried to deny his previous day's statement. At this stage, the court witnessed a noisy scene as both the prosecution and the defence started arguing over the issue. An angry Zahir then drew attention of the judge, Mia Mohammad Sharif, saying there is a different law for the securities market. \"Ten things can accumulate and become a fraudulent act. The individual act may not appear that much illegal.\" If three people shout on the streets saying \"pukur, pukur, pukur\", it might not be considered an offence. But if the same people are found to be employees of a company then it becomes something different. The accused in this case took advantage of SEC loopholes. \"You (defence) said that the shares were deposited with sister companies and there is no such law that prohibits them from doing it. I will prove that there are such laws,\" Zahir said. \"The share markets' heavenly rise became a boon for you (the accused). And when the wise men came to buy after taking 'ganja', you handed them your (sponsors and associate companies') shares. What prompted them to come? The rumours about cement and ceramic factories,\" he said. Zahir pointed out that the defence had said \"rights (shares) were not illegal ... charging high premiums were not illegal. \"But I say if someone takes advantage of the situation, it is illegal\". Zahir disagreed with defence lawyers that there were no names in the complaint petitions, pointing to copies of the petitions. They (defence lawyers) said that the two accused are chairman and vice-chairman but in the petition they were mentioned as directors and that they only chaired meetings. When the advertisement about cement company was published in the press, the decision must have come from meetings of the board of directors of the company which were chaired either by the chairman or the vice-chairman, Zahir continued. \"I thank defence lawyer Rafiqul Huq for saying they merely chaired the meetings. If we take the defence arguments, it means that they (chairman and vice-chairman) must have known as they were part of the meetings.\" He pointed out that the probe committee in its report said some employees of the associate group of companies' sales department employees were engaged in selling Shinepukur shares. Zahir referred to earlier defence arguments: \"They are paid employees and my clients are the ones who chair meetings. They are not responsible for day to day affairs of the company.\" But, he added, we have to see who the employers are. \"My friends in the defence are trying to establish that the employees were out of office and were engaged in share trading without informing the office,\" Zahir argued. \"You (judge) have to see the real people behind the scene. The people who are sponsors and directors of the associate companies. You will find the same group of people. You may not find a link if you do not remove the curtains. But once you do that you will find common faces and names.\" The 'common faces', he said, schemed to manipulate the market. All their activities collectively aimed at one objective -- manipulation. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court went through the report and found prima facie evidence, Zahir argued. He then tried to produce a letter to the judge but the defence lawyers objected saying they had not been allowed to do the same the previous day. But the judge overruled the defence objection when prosecution lawyers argued that the reference of the letter was there in the probe committee report. \"The connection papers can be shown,\" the judge said. Zahir read out a letter by Salman Rahman who had given a reply to SEC queries as director of Beximco Investment Company Ltd (BICL) on behalf of Shinepukur. Drawing attention of the court to the content of the letter, Zahir read out a part of the letter stating that \"he (MD) does not know. So I am responding.\" \"Wasn't there an MD of Shinepukur to reply? Why Salman as director of BICL. But his lawyers are saying he only chairs meetings and knows nothing. And the company's day-to-day affairs are run by the management. Where was the management of the company in this case?,\" he asked. Zahir then pointed to the probe committee report saying \"this itself is a prima facie evidence ... and it's not a false report as I have produced the supportive documents\". These illegal acts are only a \"pointer\" to what happened in the UK and Australia, he said. \"It's a classic example of manipulation.\" The list of witnesses is there and would be produced when required, he said. Zahir then read out a section of the probe committee report stating \"the committee interviewed a good number of people directly or indirectly related to share market operations. Almost all expressed their opinion that at the peak time some major shareholders, some associates having large shares and some sales department employees of the group and few brokers operated directly and indirectly in a big way in the sale of Shinepukur shares and some other shares of the group namely Beximco Pharma, Beximco Ltd, Beximco Fisheries, Padma Textiles etc etc.\" \"The ingredients of offence are very much there. And by saying 'we (the accused) are not the employees of the company', liabilities cannot be avoided.\" Zahir then replied to defence arguments regarding Singer and BD Lamps prices which had also gone high. \"Should they be charged? They did not give public disclosures to manipulate the price from Tk 73 to 754.\" \"Singer price was just doubled but the Shinepukur share price rose manifold ... Singer gave 85 per cent dividends ... BD Lamps also gave high dividends ... how much did you give?\" He said an application was filed with the SEC to set up Shinepukur Ceramic Ltd. On May 22 1997, through a letter, they withdrew their earlier application seeking consent. \"Please be informed we do not intend to continue with the subject application any longer and therefore, you are requested to treat our application as withdrawn from this moment onward,\" Zahir quoted the letter as telling the SEC. He said that they withdrew the letter because the market crashed. He also read out another SEC letter to a director of Beximco Group dated November 11, 1997 which said that \"as you have not complied with the Commission's requirements, nor communicated with the Commission since March 6, 1997, we regret to inform you that the Commission has to reject your application of 15.01.1997... The file has therefore been closed at our end.\" Zahir presented the contents of the letter in response to defence claim that the authorities had refused permission to set up the cement factory. \"The ceramic industry and the cement idea was already spread out in the market as mentioned in the committee report and the applications were filed to justify those rumours. These were withdrawn because the market had crashed and the purpose had already been served. It was therefore no use to continue with these things as the man who came to buy share has come after taking \"ganja\" and had already bought shares,\" Zahir said, referring to Rafiqul Huq's statement the previous day. Zahir then said that a visitor came to him yesterday morning. The visitor, he said, showed a newspaper to say: \"Sir, I am the man who took \"ganja\" and bought shares. If buying Beximco means taking ganja, yes, I had ganja. Please tell this to court.\" At this stage, Zahir concluded his arguments, pleading to allow prosecution of the accused. Special Public Prosecutor Syed Rezaur Rahman said it was a matter of regret that a person like Serajul Huq (defence lawyer) made indecent remarks about Bengalis. \"How could he say 'Bangali hujuke mate' (Bangalis pay heed to rumours)? Similar statements were made in 1971 when Bengalis were fighting for freedom.\" \"I was astonished to hear such a remark from such a person who fought the War of Liberation in 1971. In 1971, (some) people said such things but we won our Independence. Such innocent acts of the general public should not be described in such a manner,\" Rahman said. He also said that the defence lawyers were trying to pass the blame on to the SEC, the government and the finance minister. \"What does the probe committee report say?\" he asked. He also said there was no such precedence of such a lengthy hearing on charge framing. \"And I thank the court for sparing so much time.\" The court was adjourned at this stage. Hearing on charge framing of Beximco begins Earlier, defence lawyer Rafiqul Huq began his arguments on the case of Beximco Pharmaceuticals and said the first two charges against the Beximco were similar to Shinepukur's, which had been discussed. It neither falls under section 17 nor under section 24 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance 1969, he said. He said that the accused in this case were chairman Sohel F Rahman, vice-chairman Salman F Rahman and managing director DH Khan. In this case also, the chairman and the vice-chairman are accused, he said, repeating his argument that \"they only chair meetings and are not responsible for day-to-day affairs of the company\". \"The rights share issue in this case was also a matter of 1994 which was raised after two years.\" Regarding high premiums, he said, In 1994, the SEC gave permission for charging premium \"and in 1996 they are saying the premium should have been Tk 800 not Tk 1100\". He also produced, and drew attention of the court to, documents relating to approval of charging such premiums. \"So where is the criminal motive?\" Regarding share split (Tk 100 into Tk 10s), he said, everything was done with the consent of SEC and shares were split as demanded by the shareholders in an extra-ordinary general meeting (EGM). Even now, the defence lawyer said, many companies are splitting their shares for the benefit of the shareholders. \"The law also permits so. Where is the offence in splitting shares?\" Regarding probe committee report on trading of 60 per cent of the company shares by certain brokers, Rafiqul Huq said, \"It is the brokers who traded the company shares ... why should my clients be charged?. My clients have not committed any offence that attracts section 17 or 24, yet they are accused. Why?\" As Rafiqul Huq concluded, Dr Zahir stood to argue that it was unprecedented that the defence lawyers opened arguments before the prosecution. \"Anyway, it was good for me as I know what they have in mind. It has put me in an advantageous position.\" The judge at this stage said it was the request from the prosecution side asking permission to allow the defence to open the Beximco Pharma case. Dr Zahir said the defence had already talked about the case on the previous day. Zahir then started his arguments on Shinepukur.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/innocent-acts-can-be-illegal-if-taken-together-prosecution", "date": "1999-01-07T00:00:30+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 2053},
{"title": "Forgotten Bhagat Singh", "body": "STRANGE, there was no meeting or seminar to remember Bhagat Singh, who still lives in the memory of every Indian. I was still in a primary school when the revolutionary Bhagat Singh was hanged 82 years ago, to be precise on March 23, 1931. Even though more than eight decades have passed, the feeling of his loss has not lessened. An uproar against the British united the country and so strong was the feeling that nobody was willing to name his comrade (Hans Raj Vohra), who agreed to be the official witness. Hans Raj Vohra was a close companion of Bhagat Singh and spilled the beans as soon as he was arrested. Although his version is different, he said that since Sukhdev, one of the persons who were hanged along with Bhagat Singh, told everything to the police, Hans Raj told the British the whole thing in detail, where the revolutionaries would make the bombs and where some among them were located in the country. Although he had not forgiven his father for making a written request to the tribunal saying that his son was innocent and that he had nothing to do with police officer John Saunder's murder, he knew his father was a sincere patriot who had devoted his life to the cause of independence. His father's filial affection at times had embarrassed Bhagat Singh the revolutionary. But he knew the harrowed look in his father's eyes was his way of saying sorry. Bhagat Singh had chided his father through a letter. He wrote to Hans Raj, saying: \"I have not been able to understand how you could think it proper to submit such a petition at this stage and in these circumstances…You know that in the political field my views have always differed with those of yours. I have always been acting independently without having cared for your approval or disapproval.\" Head jail warden Charat Singh indicated to him that the time allotted for the mulaqat (meeting) was over. But Bhagat Singh lingered. His family's love had overwhelmed him. He was pensive. Charat Singh told him to hurry up. His relatives embraced Bhagat Singh one by one. He touched his mother's feet. It was a gesture of reverence but it brought tears to everyone's eyes. His sisters sobbed openly. Bhagat Singh was greatly upset. \"Stay together,\" were his last words to them. Then he folded his hands and left. On his way back to his cell he saw Sukhdev and Rajguru still standing behind iron bars, forlorn and lonely. Despite Charat Singh asking him not to, he stopped to chat with them. It will be any day now, he told them. The last meeting with his family was indicative of it. They nodded in assent. Back in his cell, Bhagat Singh touched his kurta which was damp with the tears of his family. Little Kultar, his youngest brother, had wept incessantly. As he clung to his older brother and said goodbye he had sobbed, \"Life will not be worth living without you.\" His innocent, grief-stricken face haunted Bhagat Singh. As the cell door closed behind him, he reached for his pen and wrote him a letter in Urdu, the language he normally used in personal letters. The letter to Kultar was done. He hoped his words would soothe his brother. But what about the millions of people who believed in him? After writing to his brother, Bhagat Singh reached for a notebook he maintained. It was neither a personal account nor a record of his reactions. He just jotted down his favourite passages from the books he was reading. They were passages, mostly in English, by thinkers like Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Hobbers, Locke, Rousseau, Trotsky, Bertrand Russel, Karl Marx and Engels. Among the Indian authors he read were Rabindranath Tagore and Lajpat Rai. Bhagat Singh was also fond of poetry. He would recite even from Wordsworth, Byron and Omar Khayyam. But his favourite was Ghalib, whom he quoted frequently. The meeting with his family had shaken him emotionally but Bhagat Singh took it in his stride and immersed himself once again in his books. As the news of his execution spread, the nation went into mourning. There were processions throughout the country. Many went without food. People wore black badges and shut down their businesses to express their grief. The British stayed indoors. Among the Indian political leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru was the first to pay his tributes. Nehru said that Bhagat Singh was a clean fighter who faced the enemy in an open field. He was a young boy full of passionate zeal for the country. He was like a spark that grew into a great flame in a short time and spread from one city of the country to the other, illuminating darkness everywhere. Mahatma Gandhi was profuse in his praise for the courage of the executed heroes. He said: \"Bhagat Singh and his companions' death seem to have been a personal loss to many. I join in the tributes paid to the memory of these young men…\" But these words were lost on many people who were angry with Gandhiji for not having done enough to save Bhagat Singh and his comrades. Faced with the public's ugly mood, Congress leaders tried to come up with several explanations for their failure to rescind the sentence. But nothing worked to soothe the frayed tempers of the public. For the past three years, we the Indians and the Pakistanis have been celebrating Bhagat Singh's birthday at the very crossing where he was hanged. We have been lighting candles and garlanding his life size photo at the site. We have recalled the hanging of Ashfhaqullah, who went to the gallows with the Koran dangling from his neck, by reciting one of his couplets which reflected his patriotic sentiments, not religious.

Although the estimated cost of the bridge itself is about Tk 987 crore, the maximum expenditure is being incurred for river training, which is about Tk 1204 crore. The second huge amount is being spent on the construction of the 32 kilometre link road, rehabilitation of 10,000 families displaced by the bridge, the link road and other programmes including environment protection. Metergauge and Broadgauge rail tract, 232 KVA electric transmission line, gas pipe line and most modern telecommunication system of optic fibre will be set up over the 60 feet wide 4-lane bridge. It is the 11th longest bridge in the world and the longest road bridge in South Asia but its technological aspects and the construction process bear extraordinary features, according to experts here. When completed the bridge will span the river in a semi-circle unlike the commonly seen straight bridges. The authority takes the help of satellite in the construction of the bridge and necessary equipment have been set up to observe and monitor the flow, nature and behavior of the river. Another feature of the bridge is strong base of its pillars. Average depth of each pillar is 83 metres or 90 yards and 121 such pillars have been set up. Hydraulic hammers were used for setting the pillars. Average weight of a hammer is about 234 tons which accelerates upto 1700 tons in operation. The floors of the bridge is constructed in pieces which is called segment and out of 1214 such segment, 1000 have already been set up. Two embankments have been constructed on both sides of the bridge to protect the banks from river erosion. To protect the embankment geo-textiles have been placed from the bottom of the river. The synthetic geo-textiles are so strong that it cannot be destroyed in one hundred years by water, soil, iron and other materials. On the western end of the bridge, 17 kilometres of approach road from Nakla to Saydabad and on the eastern end, 15 kilometres from Srifabad to Alenga are being constructed along with 22 culverts and 12 small bridges. Construction work has already been completed on the western side of the approach road while work of the eastern side will be completed by April next. About 9,000 acres of land have been acquired for the construction of the bridge, embankment and roads. Now the last phase work of the bridge is going on day and night in a very disciplined and methodical way. About 2600 people from home and abroad are working on the project.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/work-on-in-full-swing-for-opening-on-schedule", "date": "1998-01-01T00:00:02+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 509},
{"title": "New coalition govt formed in Japan", "body": "TOKYO, Jan 14: Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi formed a new Cabinet on Thursday to launch a coalition government with a major opposition group in a move designed to strengthen his administration's hand in Parliament, reports AP. The announcement of the new Cabinet line-up came just hours after a last-minute breakthrough was struck late Wednesday which ended a dispute over security issues that had threatened to scuttle the partnership between Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Liberal Party. Despite the deal, the Liberal Democrats still lack a majority in the Upper House of Parliament. But by joining hands with the Liberals, Obuchi hopes to help smooth the passage of key bills aimed at reviving Japan's economy and upgrading its defence alliance with the United States. \"I formed the coalition government and reshuffled the Cabinet because it is necessary to share the responsibility with the Liberals... to overcome the crisis we face today,\" Obuchi said at a press conference. The coalition partners are both viewed as conservative forces in Parliament. In fact, many Liberal Party lawmakers were once members of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Liberal Party is the sixth largest party in the Upper House of Parliament, and the third largest in the more powerful Lower House. Liberal Party Secretary General Takeshi Noda landed the post of Home Affairs Minister. Noda had served as a Cabinet minister twice with the governing party before leaving it in the early 1990s. Two Cabinet posts - the National Land Agency and Science and Technology Agency - were eliminated under the coalition pact and incorporated as part of the Construction Ministry and the Science and Technology Agency, respectively. The number of ministers in the new Cabinet was cut to 18 from the previous 20, in line with concessions that the ruling party made to the Liberal Party on streamlining the government. The three outgoing ministers have submitted their resignations to Obuchi. The latest coalition comes a year after the ruling party's previous deal with two liberal-leaning opposition groups was officially disbanded. Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa declined Obuchi's offer of a Cabinet post, saying he wanted to devote his energies to running his own party, Obuchi said. A political maverick, Ozawa bolted from the ranks of the LDP in 1993, vowing to offer a real opposition alternative and to end four decades of political dominance by Liberal Democrats. The coalition talks had been stalled for weeks over the Liberal Party's demand to expand Japan's international military role, a move the LDP and many other opposition parties said was unconstitutional. The two sides agreed Wednesday to allow the Self Defence Forces, Japan's military, to \"actively participate and cooperate\" in UN peacekeeping missions if asked by the global body. Japan's Constitution prohibits the country from participating in missions that use force to settle international disputes.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/new-coalition-govt-formed-in-japan", "date": "1999-01-15T00:00:22+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 471},

{"title": "AN UNHAPPY HOMECOMING", "body": "When Mamun came back after nine years of illegal work in Manchester, UK, his body went on a strike. He had a high fever which refused to go away, and he had to be hospitalised. The doctors could not find out what it was. “My sadness made me ill,” Mamun says. He has been back on his homeland for a few months now, but the returned migrant still cannot handle the weather in his native land: he often faces breathing difficulty. “I know that this is my country, but I cannot feel it anymore,” the 31-year-old says and wipes the sweat off his forehead. Mamun's physical suffering is the visible expression of his despair. But there are problems even worse than his. In order to finance his travel to the UK, Mamun's parents sold their house. Now, they expect him to pay back the money. But Mamun has come back – like many of the returning migrants – with empty pockets. Workers often paint a rosy picture to their families back home, hiding the harsh realities of their living conditions abroad. Photo: Zahedul I Khan He did not have a proper job all this while. An unscrupulous broker took heaps of cash from Mamun, promising a well-paid job in the UK. Upon his arrival, Mamun realised that there was no such job waiting for him. He illegally worked as a cooking help in restaurants to make ends meet. He earned around Tk 28,000 every month, a decent sum for a family living in Bangladesh. But because of the high living expenses in the UK, he could not send any money back home. Then a few months ago, Mamun's illegal resident status came under the nose of the UK Border Agency. After three nights in detention, he was deported. Now he lives in Dhaka with some friends. “I didn't even dare to go back to my village, I feel too ashamed,” he says. Due to lack of education, Mamun is facing troubles finding a job. With the help of an NGO, he is trying to set up a second-hand car business. But if there is a possibility to go back abroad again, he will take it, the young man adds – “I have nothing to lose.” Waiting for a better life in a foreign land. Photo: palash khan Mamun is not alone. In spite of many success stories, there are tens of thousands of failed migration in this country. Like Mamun, they cannot share their experiences with their communities. This behaviour is natural, says Shakirul Islam, chairman of Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Programme (OKUP), a grassroots migrants organisation. “If someone shares his difficulties, he lowers his social status,” he explains. OKUP and other organisations support the returned migrants with various offers such as medical assistance, psychological treatment, skills training, economic reintegration, legal assistance to file cases against cheating agencies and so on. The needs are tremendous, they say. Help at the airport The helplessness begins at the airport. “When you come back, you see so many changes that you even have trouble finding your way home,” says Syed Saiful Haque, chairman of the Welfare Association for the Rights of Bangladeshi Emigrants (WARBE). He was a migrant himself in the 1980s. Keeping it in mind, various organisations offer a meet-and-greet service at the airport, to help the migrants organise their trip back to the villages. But not all of the migrants expect a happy welcome party. “Especially the female domestic workers who were abused or tortured abroad come back highly traumatised,” says Islam. Therefore, sometimes the families are not ready to receive them. His organisation provides those women with shelter and medical assistance and mediates with their families. Once they are rehabilated, the women can go back to their relatives. High expectations Another challenge for many migrant workers is to face the high expectations of their families. “Many returnees cannot fulfill all the wishes and requests,” says Haque. As a consequence, instead of heading towards their villages, some hide in the capital after their return. However, in most cases, the expectations are created by the migrants themselves: because they do not want to show how dirty and dangerous their workplaces in the Middle East or elsewhere are, they pretend to be rich and happy. “They send photos of themselves in front of expensive cars, instead of pictures of the dirty and crowded dorm they sleep in,” Haque adds. Despite tiring ordeals they still want to go abroad and try their luck. Although most of the migrants remit all their earnings, their families still expect them to come back with pockets full, Haque says. All that they have worked hard for is spent by their family, leaving them with next to nothing to bank on when they return. The 34-year-old Walid has gone through this experience. “If you go abroad, you will become a money-making machine for your family,” says the returned migrant who spent five years in London. Domestic worker Mahmuda, too, has been used like a “cash cow” by her husband, she says. The 41-year-old, who went to Abu Dhabi in 1989, is a very successful migrant. The migration had been her husband's idea, as the migration cost for women is lower, he had argued. Migrant workers who fled Lybia wait for their plane back home. Now, many of them want to go back. Photo: Palash Khan Mahmuda worked for 19 years as a domestic worker in the United Arab Emirates, with hardly ever facing any problem. Every two years she came back to Bangladesh to see her husband and the three children she had left behind. “I sent all my money to my husband. I bought two cars, a house and also financed the two weddings of my daughters,” Mahmuda says. Thinking she had secured a comfortable life for her family with her toils of 19 years, she decided to come back to her land – and finally enjoy life. But a nasty reality greeted her in Bangladesh. “I discovered that my husband had sold all the properties, wasted all the money and married another woman,” Mahmuda says. She – the woman who had financed all her husband's wealth – was literally thrown away. Now Mahmuda lives in misery and without family. “For the sake of money I sacrified my life as a mother. And now I am alone,” she says. But there is still some hope: Mahmuda is filing a case against her husband. She wants to get divorced and – first of all – retrieve her money back. At the moment, Mahmuda is saving money to go back abroad again. “People in my village have spread nasty rumours about my character and I have no prospect here of finding a job similar to my work abroad,” she explains. Poor Job Prospects Due to low education, the job prospects are bleak for many returnees. “Before they leave the country, the migrant workers don't care about their skills,” says Shakirul. They only dream of making money. Bangladesh traditionally exports unskilled labourers, says Grégoire Crettaz from the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Only 30 percent of the migrants have skills, he estimates. An yet-to-be published survey of more than 7,000 Libya returnees by the IOM gives an idea about the education level of the average migrant to the Middle Eastern countries: almost 40 percent of the surveyed migrants said they had no formal education or incomplete primary school experience. Only four percent of the migrants had completed their higher secondary education. If migrant workers left with better skills their job prospects abroad would significantly improve. Photos: Prabir Das The unskilled people not only carry a higher risk of being exploited abroad, they also struggle hard with the reintegration, Crettaz says. Back home, they are not able to find a job nearly as well paid as abroad. There are mainly three options for unskilled returned migrants, he says. Either they start a small business like a grocery or a garment shop, they go back abroad again or they start selling their dreams. The latter means working for one of the many migrant recruiting agencies – to perpetuate a vicious cycle. The same migrant workers who have learnt how unpleasant and hard working one's life abroad can be, start telling their neighbours in the villages how successful and nice their time was. And the impressionable unskilled people are likely to believe any positive story about migration. In their euphoria, they forget about the risks such as high loans and cheating agencies. Unscrupulous agents and middlemen have often left migrant workers jobless or in foreign prisons And even then, a migration does not always guarantee a better life. According to the Bangladesh Households Remittances Survey 2009, over 70 percent of migrants paid between Tk 100,000 and Tk 300,000 to migrate, while average salaries ranged between Tk 5,000 to Tk 20,000 a month. This means the migrants often are forced to sell their lands and take on high interest loans to afford the cost of migration. If they cannot stay abroad for several years, they do not come back with pockets full of money – but with huge debts. Twenty-four-year-old domestic worker Maksuda shares this bad experience, too. After being tortured and badly injured by her mistress in Lebanon, she managed to come back to Bangladesh after 14 months. But her situation has not improved, she says bitterly. “Now my husband blames me for the debts from the migration costs and beats me every day.” Because her broken arm still has not healed, Maksuda can only work one-handed as a tailor. “As a disabled person I earn even less than before my departure,” she says. Sick at Home Another crucial issue is the health of the returnees. The Bangladeshi workers destined for low-skilled jobs abroad are also at high risk of workplace injury. About 60 percent of the migrants experienced workplace injury while abroad, while 34 percent reported to have ended up with a physical disability as a result of that injury, says a survey of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR,B). “This diminished their usual level of activity,” concludes ICDDR,B. They come home sick, too. “Many of the migrants who lived illegally in the UK and were forced to return suffering from breathing problems, asthma, high blood pressure or diabetes,” says Quamrun Naher, programme officer of Caritas. Others go through severe bouts of depression. “They don't understand what has happened to them and become perplexed,” she explains. Photo: Zahedul I Khan Migrant workers also run the risk of being infected with serious diseases. In the Middle East countries, migrants must prove that they are healthy in order to get a visa extention. People who are pregnant, infected with HIV or suffer from tuberculosis are sent back immediately, says Anita Davies, chief migration health officer of IOM. Often, the ill migrants are not informed about the exact reason for their return and come back without any knowledge of their health problems, she adds. Due to absence of health insurances, the majority of the returned ill migrants cannot afford a proper medical treatment – neither abroad nor at home. In the case of HIV, the unawareness is also very dangerous for the wives or husbands of the infected persons, she emphasises. At the end of 2011, the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) reported 2,533 registered HIV cases in Bangladesh. Over half of the infections in 2011 were migrant related – either returning migrant workers, their spouse or partners. Besides these official statistics, experts estimate a growing number of unreported cases. After unimaginable hardship women migrant workers may return home where they are no longer welcome. Photo: Star File “All migrants should have access to affordable pre- and post-departure health assessments and treatments when requested,” claims Davies. At the moment, IOM is analysing the situation and – in cooperation with the Bangladeshi government – is developing a national health strategy for migrants. Among other conclusions, IOM recommends strongly that migrants have comprehensive health insurance coverage. If 28-year-old domestic worker Sharifa had had a health insurance, her life would be much easier now. Sharifa went to Lebanon as a domestic worker in 2009. “My husband sent me to Lebanon after a thief had stolen all his property,” Sharifa says. The domestic help was working in Lebanon for three years, when the accident happened: she fell from a ladder and got badly injured. For the surgery of her leg and her back Sharifa spent all the money she had earned before. Due to the injury Sharifa could not stay in Lebanon and came back to Bangladesh. “We still have to pay back the whole loan,” she says. Sharifa still suffers from headaches and is not able to walk like she used to before. But the family cannot afford further medical treatment. Sharifa has two jobs at the moment: she works as a cook and in her free time she sells saris and fabrics for salwar kameez. “I really don't know how we will pay back the loan of Tk 90,000,” she says. Migrant workers who have had to come back often find themselves in huge debt and with no assets left to sell. Photo: Enamul Haq Go back again If Sharifa could, she would go abroad again. “For an unskilled person like me, this is the only solution to paying back the loan,” she says. The IOM-survey of Libya returnees draws the same conclusion: 61 percent of the returned migrants stated they want to go back abroad. Shakirul Islam is not surprised by this result. “There is a lack of reintegration by the government and as a consequence a lack of prospect in the villages,” he says. Even bad experiences abroad cannot stop the migrants to try their luck again, he adds. Shakirul, too, would never stop anyone from remigrating. “Migration should always be a personal and free decision.” But according to him, a decision should be made only by well-informed people. If all the migrants were aware of the risks such as injury and illness or exploitation and cheating by the agencies and employers, the reintegration of the migrants would become much easier. Therefore, the government should not only provide the returning migrants with better reintegration support, but also raise awareness before the people make the decision to migrate, Islam says. “And if the migrant workers leave our country with some skills, they run less risks to be cheated abroad,” he adds. The government is working hard to improve the situation, the Minister of the Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, recently said at the inauguration of a migration project office of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). “We have learnt from our mistakes and we still are learning,” he added. More than 30 skill training centres for migrants are under construction. In a few months, there will be more than 60 centres in the whole country, the Minister promised. It is about time the government and society at large recognise the importance of taking care of those who contribute so much to our economy, whether they are going abroad or coming back home.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/an-unhappy-homecoming", "date": "2013-03-22T00:06:08+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 2519},

The gates at the crossing were not closed at the time of the accident, he added. Of the injured, Ripon Miah succumbed to his injuries after he was rushed to Enam Medical College Hospital in Savar. Two other injured passengers were admitted to a local private clinic, sources said. Rafiqul Islam, sub-inspector (SI) of the government railway police in Kamalapur, said there was no gateman at the crossing when the accident happened. Quoting Atol Halder, 27, an injured passenger, Rafiqul said there were eight passengers in the three-wheeler. \"We urged the driver to stop before passing away the crossing.

{"title": "Overseas trade wings sputter", "body": "Operations of about 50 per cent commercial wings of Bangladesh missions abroad have almost come to a halt, as posts of trade officials remain vacant. Official sources said 10 posts of trade officials, who include economic minister, commercial councilor and first secretary (commercial), have been lying vacant for about a year against 20 designated posts. In London, Beijing, Brussels and Los Angels, Washington and Moscow posts of commercial councilors are lying vacant. Posts of first secretary (commercial) are vacant in London, Kuala Lumpur and Ottawa while the post of economic minister in New York is also lying vacant. Sources said the vacant posts are not filled due to lack of cooperation from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). There is also an acute shortage of efficient officials in the Ministry of Commerce, resulting in delay of appointment, the sources added. They said Bangladeshi envoys have made several requests for appointment of officials in the vacant posts. Bangladesh has 20 commercial wings. A high-powered committee headed by the Commerce Minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury recently recommended names of commercial councilors for the commercial wings in Brussels and Beijing, but it was rejected by the PMO without assigning any reason, sources said. The committee included Commerce Secretary Suhel Ahmad, Foreign Secretary Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury and Establishment Secretary AB Chowdhury. In November last year, the committee nominated two persons who secured highest score out of 44 applicants for Beijing and Brussels. The committee had sent its nominations to the PMO, which asked the commerce ministry to propose a total of three names for each mission. As per the instruction, the commerce ministry again sent fresh proposals to the PMO at the end of December 2002, which were also rejected by the PMO in March this year, saying the candidates were not qualified. The PMO also directed the commerce ministry to nominate fresh officials in place of previously short listed ones. As per the fresh instructions the commerce ministry through newspaper advertisements sought applications for appointment of commercial councilors for missions in Brussels and Beijing. Previous applicants were barred from applying. Talking to The Daily Star, one of the disgruntled applicant, who was short listed as per the recommendations of the high-powered committee, said it is a sheer injustice to bar previously qualified applicants from applying them again. The delay in appointment of the key position in the commercial wings is hurting the country since 85 per cent export destinations of Bangladesh fall in the European Union (EU) and USA. Besides, early appointment is deemed important as the post-MFA (multi fibre arrangement) regime draws near. Many fear situations in the trade wings will worsen in near future, as the tenures of commercial councilors in Canberra, Tehran and Moscow expired about a year back. The formalities of the new recruitment for the posts have not been completed yet, sources said. \"Any further delay in filling the posts may hit Bangladesh export hard,\" a top frozen food exporter said. In the absence of adequate and qualified officials in the commercial wings in Brussels where the European Commission (EC) and the World Customs Organization headquarters are located, the Bangladeshi mission there is failing to cope with the work pressure, sources said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/overseas-trade-wings-sputter", "date": "2003-05-26T00:00:20+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 533},

{"title": "Sad stories from NU", "body": "The National University hurries on to hold yet another haphazardly arranged examination from January 24, refusing to look into some seemingly realistic problems and reasonable pleas of the Honours Final examinees of 1998. Hundreds of students from different city colleges thronged the NU campus in Gazipur on December 26 and demanded that the January 24 examination be deferred. They were alleging irregularities, hassle and mismanagement done both by the NU and their colleges. Students, laying siege to the office of the NU pro vice-chancellor, said their colleges were way behind schedule in completing the courses for which they would be tested in the examinations. They alleged that most of the colleges could hardly finish 50-60 per cent of the Part-III course. Moreover, knowing the intention of the NU, colleges also were also not taking any step to help students finish the courses on an emergency basis. For the yearly courses, it is customary that the colleges should complete the courses within six months and give the students a three-month space to prepare before they write their final examinations. Responding to the agitating students, the NU authorities assured them of rescheduling the examination, possibly sometime in March. But then, four days later, the university announced on December 30 that the Part-III examination would start on January 24 and run up to March 3. The announcement came in a low-circulation Bangla newspaper. Meantime, the NU and the carefree colleges went off to long Eid vacation, forgetting that they had one important business to do. About 100,000 students haven't received their admit cards as yet. \"Nothing goes right in our schools, colleges and universities. I have seen it for years,\" said one angry parent, who came with his helpless daughter to the NU campus in Gazipur. Indeed, thousands of students across the country were caught off guard. \"Once more they have been left to suffer this year because of the authorities' indifference,\" said the parent, speaking on condition of anonymity. The NU would not open until January 18, only six days before the examination starts. \"Our nerves will be tested till then. But who cares,\" fumed a student yesterday. Very recently, the BA (pass) examinees went through a similar trial. Students were seen scrambling for their admit cards in city colleges even the day before they were to sit for their examinations. While university officials privately admit their mismanagement, nothing has changed. \"It was the same story when Dhaka and other universities used to administer the examinations. The National University, the very purpose of which was to straighten out the messy affair, hasn't changed anything,\" said one NU official. Senior NU officials, available, would not say anything. After repeated attempts, the vice-chancellor and the controller of examinations could not be reached for comment. In most colleges, student counseling doesn't simply exist. \"There aren't many teachers around to ask for assistance,\" said a frustrated examinee from the Eden College to The Daily Star. \"Those of us going to a NU-affiliated college are faced with peculiar circumstances. We are taught mostly by guest teachers from either Dhaka or Jahangirnagar University who wouldn't care if the courses are done in time or not,\" said a Lalmatia College student. One can imagine that things are far worse in colleges outside the capital. \"In most cases, the whole process is just a farce. You're a good teacher if you allow the students to resort to whatever means needed to pass the examinations. Whether a teacher is regular in his/her classes is immaterial,\" said a government college teacher from Comilla. \"I have seen it everywhere outside Dhaka.\" This may have spared the non-Dhaka college students of the nerve tests, but those from the capital pay the price. Even in better-known government colleges such as Eden College, younger teachers speak of a pathetic lack of coordination between the NU and the affiliated institutions. \"NU never bothers to know how things are going in colleges. Colleges do not care to finish the courses on time since there's no pressure on them,\" adds the Eden teacher. Then again, the students are paying more in fees, often for non-academic purposes. A Lalmatia College student alleged that each had to pay nearly Tk 14000 for the Part-III Honours course, which included only Taka 650 for examination fees. The \"college fund\" gobbles up the rest. A student pays again the similar sums if she has to get re-admitted for some reason, often for the authorities' mismanagement. Sad stories abound. One English Literature student, who hit the top position in the first two years of her Honours course among all students in Bangladesh, was ironically placed in the third class. She cannot run the risk of going through the process of correction as the results came barely two weeks ago. She is confident of getting it all corrected if a proper review is done, but does not have the confidence in the system. \"If for some reason I don't get it right, I miss another year!\" said the hapless girl, sobbing as her family shares her trauma. Another, who made second all through, is in the dark if she has passed at all. If both have to sit again, they face a new syllabus. But their teacher, Professor Guljar Begum, is in the dark too. Reached by phone last night, she said she had no knowledge of such irregularities nor did she receive any complaints. \"I am new to this college,\" said the head of English at Eden College who took over in January last year. As mismanagement becomes the norm, one only looks back at the story behind the NU's birth. \"The NU itself was born in haste,\" recalls an education ministry official, referring to its ways of doing its sole business -- administration of examinations.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/sad-stories-from-nu", "date": "2000-01-06T00:00:11+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 961},

{"title": "Extract: Kamila Shamzie", "body": "Here is an extract from Kamila Shamzie's novel Kartography, one of the latest Indo-Anglian novels on the market. Shamzie was born in Karachi in 1973. She is the author of In the City by the Sea--winner of the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize--and Salt and Saffron. She teaches creative writing at Hamilton College in New York. It is 1987. Raheen, the narrator, and Karim, her closest friend, both thirteen-year-olds in Rahim Yaar Khan, a town in the Punjab, for the winter holidays, staying on lands belonging to their parents' friends, Laila and Asif. Karim has just announced, much to Raheen's surprise, that when he grows up he wants to be a map-maker. We were without obsessions at the time, a rare occurrence in our lives. A few months earlier it had been birds. We became buyers of bird books, spouters of bird-facts ('the hummingbird eats 50 or 60 meals a day,' 'the Gila woodpecker lives in the desert and never sees wood, only cactus'), imitators of bird-walks (moving through the world on our toes, heels in the air), though the fascination with feathered creatures was necessarily short-lived since all we could see in our gardens were crows and sparrows, and what's the point of being bird-obsessed if you can't bird-watch. Prior to that, we'd filled our lives with disguises. We'd wander under loose shirts, stick black paper over our teeth, and even collected hair clippings from Auntie Runty's beauty parlour and attempted to glue straight long tresses to the ends of our own hair. How each of our obsessions started, and how they ended, and who instigated their beginnings and ends we never remembered or cared about. But I cared deeply when Karim started pulling atlases out of Uncle Asif's bookshelf, the day after we arrived in Rahim Yar Khan, and traced distances and routes with his index finger, without any regard or concern for my total uninterest in the relationship of one place to another. 'You can't be a map maker anyway,' I said to him one morning when I found him in Uncle Asif's desk poring over a large map of Pakistan with creases where it had been folded and re-folded into a neat rectangle. 'Because all the maps have been made already, right? What are you going to do? Discover a new continent and map it?' I hoisted myself onto the desk and sat down in the 'disputed territory' of Jammu and Kashmir. 'Better way to occupy yourself is to come outside and lose a game of badminton to me. Or we could walk to the dunes. Or leap around the cotton mountain.' He took the glass of orange juice I held out to him, and gulped it down. Bits of pulp clung to the inside of the glass and to his upper lip. 'If you had to give someone directions to Zia's beach hut, what would you say?' I looked out the window. It was a beautiful day, winter sun beckoning us outside. 'I don't know. I'd say, go towards the beach, and when you come to the turtle sign take a right and...' 'No, idiot.' He wiped his mouth on his sleeve. 'How would you give directions to someone who didn't know the way to the beach. Maybe someone who'd left Karachi, years ago, and couldn't remember the way there any more.' 'Oh.' I considered this. 'Well, I'd just say, 'don't worry, we'll meet somewhere and go to the beach together.' Karim glared at me. 'That's not helpful.' I glare back at him. 'There's something you need to know.' I lifted him up by the collar and slammed him against the chair back. 'You hated geography!' 'Yeah, so? Every map maker has his quirks.' I couldn't help laughing. 'Fine. By the way, map makers are called cartographers.' 'Cartographers.' He wrote down the word, forming a circle with the letters, and we both bent our heads over the paper. 'Go rap her carts,' I suggested, re-arranging letters in my head. 'Strap her cargo? Crop rag heart?' Karim grinned.

{"title": "Flawed vehicles make safe air a distant dream", "body": "Removal of two-stroke vehicles is yet to offer city dwellers respite from air pollutants as thousands of faulty vehicles and brick kilns are still emitting black smokes. Officials of the Air Quality Management Project (AQMP) said with the removal of two-stroke vehicles, the city air does contain less gaseous pollutants but particulate matters have reached alarming levels and are increasing. But no initiative towards stopping unfit vehicles plying the roads is being taken. When asked about the issue, Assistant Director of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) official, Mahboob-e-Rabbani said they check the vehicle fitness once a year and that they do not allow any vehicle older that 20 years to ply. He said it is the traffic department's duty to nab unfit vehicles, not theirs. However, Deputy Commissioner (South) of Traffic Department Abu Musa Md. Fakhrul Islam Khan said they apprehend lots of faulty vehicles everyday. \"We do file cases against those vehicles, but the owners just pay Tk 200 fine and the vehicles hit the roads again\" he said. On March 27, 2002, the High Court ordered the installation of filters in the city's diesel-run vehicles within 6 months to stop particulate emission. But the directive is yet to be carried out as government has asked for a year's time to comply with the order. Experts say, diesel-run vehicle exhausts are one of the major contributors to air pollution. Thousands of unfit vehicles with faulty engines, such as pickup vans, overloaded trucks, buses and government vehicles are constantly pumping oxides of carbon, sulfur oxide and other toxic components into the atmosphere. Moreover, almost the entire government fleet of vehicles, particularly the ones run by diesel contribute to air pollution because of faulty engines. Another major source of pollution is the hundreds of brick kilns around the city that burn coal, firewood and used tyres round-the-clock between September and April of each year. Meanwhile, the particulate matter measuring equipment of the AQMP detected an extremely high density of pm10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) and pm2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) in the capital's atmosphere. This winter particulate matter in the air is very high -- an average of 140 micrograms per cubic meter and rising up to 300 microgram per cubic metre at times in the Sangsad Bhaban area. Too much exposure to particulate matters has been linked to premature deaths from respiratory and cardio-vascular illnesses, higher rates of bronchitis and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory tract infections. Other impacts of air pollution include crops and ecosystem damage, degraded visibility, soiling of buildings and water quality deterioration because of pollutant deposition. Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) officials said as many as 2,800 buses and minibuses are permitted to ply in the capital. Thousands other buses shuttle through the city from peripheral towns every day. According to a World Bank report of Feb, 2001, as many as 15,000 deaths, a million cases of sickness requiring medical treatments and 8.5 million cases of minor illnesses can be avoided if pollution levels in the air of the four cities of Bangladesh is reduced to standards set by the WHO. The report says, the economic cost of these avoidable deaths and sicknesses is estimated to be about 200 to 800 million U.S. dollars every year in Bangladesh. Interestingly, it not possible to convert diesel engines to CNG engines. When asked, Engineer Rezaul Karim, general manager of Rupantarita Prakitik Gas Company Ltd. (RPGCL) said the conversion is not economically viable. Director Operation of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) Dr. S. M. Salehuddin said some unfit diesel-run vehicles are plying the city roads illegally. It is very difficult to stop them. DC Traffic (south) Abu Musa Md. Fakhrul Islam Khan said they need pollution detector machines to mark the faulty vehicles.

{"title": "UN to adopt rules to halt cybersquatting", "body": "GENEVA, Jan 14: A UN agency may adopt new rules by this summer to stop profiteers from registering Internet addresses resembling the trademarked names of famous companies, an agency official said Wednesday, reports AP. The World International Property Organisation, which coordinates international patents, copyrights and trademarks, has begun receiving comments on the proposed rules issued last month, said Francis Gurry, legal counsel of the UN agency. The new rules aim to stop people from cybersquatting - paying the $100 fee to register, say, microsoftwindows.com as their World-Wide Web address and then trying to get Microsoft to spend thousands of money to buy the site. The rules could be finalised by the end of March and handed over to the fledgling Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the California-based group the Clinton administration chose last year to oversee the assignment of Internet addresses, Gurry said. If the Board of the international group accepts the rules, they could be implemented by this summer, he said. Under the proposed rules, ICANN would require that people registering a domain name provide details of where they can be contacted. If they cannot be reached in the case of the dispute, they would automatically be \"switched off\" from using the Internet address. Applicants would also have to agree to submit to arbitration, which could be conducted over the Internet. Decisions would be binding. Comment to WIPO's Internet site tends to be positive, Gurry said.

{"title": "The Month of Abstinence", "body": "THE holy month of ramadan has begun in Bangladesh and across the Muslim world with a message of piety, tolerance, perseverance and that to be aloof from all evil deeds. Ramadan is a month of abstinence from acts contrary to the sublime teachings of Islam. Concerted efforts are being made to inculcate the spirit and the significance of this holy month imploring enthusiastic Muslims not to indulge in extravagance, pomp and splendour while breaking the fast and indulge without any valid ground on frivolities. Sermons, posters, pamphlets and rallies have so far failed to infuse in us all the true and inner meanings and teachings connected with the month of fasting. Preserving the sanctity of the Ramadan largely depends on those who declare to observe the month in accordance with the defined principles enunciated in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah. But the most unfortunate part is that we vociferously talk, discuss and sermonise on the importance of the holy month, but, on the contrary, deliberately refrain from following the injunctions. Why this hypocrisy? Equally vital to ponder is: Why prices of essentials have marked jolly jump in the city's kitchen markets on the eve of Ramadan? Beef price jumped to Taka 80 per kg from Taka 65-70 a day before. The Consumers Association of Bangladesh in a press release said mutton was being sold at Taka 120-140 against the Dhaka City Corporation setprice of Taka 110 per kg. Price of gram, the main item for Iftar increased by Taka 5 to 6 per kg and was being sold at Taka 28-32. Price of pulses so far remained stable. Consumers are learnt to be paying Taka 3 to 5 more for one litre of soyabean oil which was sold at Taka 55 to 58. Prices of onion and garlic have registered and will, as feared by the consumers, register a sharp rise. The government as usual will pursue the wholesalers to maintain stability in prices, but who cares? The commerce ministry reviewed supply and price situation of the essential commodities in the wake of the Ramadan. The Commerce Minister made a clarion call to the businessmen and others concerned to maintain the price at the normal and subsistence level. The worst affected are the poorest of the poor who are under the yoke of grinding poverty where most of the days they even forego two morsels of food. Another vexing matter is the rapid growth of Iftar-Sehri culture which is totally anti-Islamic and repugnant to the basic principles of Islam. Fri-volity, extravaganza, competition in having large number of Iftari items, hosting Iftar receptions even by our political parties are very much agonising and puzzling too when the majority poor are struggling for bare survival. This is not Islam. How long should we continue to follow big and hefty people with ill-gotten money? We are under the wrong impression and in a fool's paradise that if every one can indulge in Iftar-Sehri spree, then why not others? It is imperative to remember that Ramadan is the month of piety, self-purification, fellow feeling, charity, cultivating the \"finer qualities in human character and above all complete surrender to Allah\". Let good sense prevail upon our political leadership and the Opposition parties as well to abstain from all evil machinations, give up hypocrisy, practice tolerance, patience and perseverance and heed to the tenets of Islam in letter and spirit. Those who are responsible and obliged to mould the life-pattern and style of the much exploited people should invariably respond to the call of this glorious month of Ramadan and refrain from false promises, catchy slogans to entice the people, and work for the welfare of the broad masses. It is incumbent upon every Muslim to keep in mind a Hadis relating to our Holy Prophet Muhammad (SM) which says: There are people who derive nothing from fasting except the pangs of starvation. They have been identified as those who cheat in weight, manipulate market prices, demand excess fares and prices from travellers, customers, patients, donations from guardians for admission to educational institutions during this holy month of Ramadan. Fasting is not at all an end in itself but a means to an end. And that end is: transforming a believer into a practising Muslim. We cannot deceive Allah. This unflinching faith in our Creator and the constant fear of accountability to Him for all our acts of omission is enough to turn the faithfuls into bonafide \"Insan\" (human beings). And to be more explicit, Ramadan is the most opportune month to regain what we have so far lost, unite once again to earn the spiritual reward.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-month-of-abstinence", "date": "1998-01-06T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 772},
{"title": "Pakistan open tour today", "body": "GWALIOR, Jan 22 (Reuters/AFP): A threat from Hindu militants behind them, the touring Pakistani cricketers finally get down to serious business on their Indian tour here Saturday. The three-day opener against India's second-string provides Wasim Akram's tourists their only chance to tune up for the first of two back-to-back Tests starting in Madras on January 28. Coach Javed Miandad said on the team's arrival in New Delhi on Thursday he would field a virtual Test-strength side for the first match so the players could get used to Indian \"conditions, crowds and security.\" Miandad himself played three Test series here in 1979, 1983 and 1987. But only Akram among the current team was part of Pakistan's last Test tour 12 years ago. \"Most of the others have played one-day cricket here, but a Test match atmosphere is very different, very tense,\" the coach said. \"They must get used to it first.\" Tight security awaits the Pakistanis when they arrive in this central Indian city late today despite firebrand Hindu leader Bal Thackeray's decision to call off violent protests against the tour. Guard dogs, troops and police were enlisted to guard Gwalior's Roop Singh Stadium. Officials in Gwalior, some 350 km (220 miles) south of New Delhi took no chances putting up a security cordon to check all vehicles coming into the city. Police said some 2,000 police and paramilitary troopers would guard the cricket ground. Sniffer dogs are being used to detect explosives and patrol dogs to guard the pitch, Durgesh Madhav Awasthi, police commandant at the stadium, told Reuters. \"They will be let loose at night, if intruders come they can kill them (intruders),\" he added. Some 15 patrol dogs from the Border Security Force were brought in to guard the pitch. Paramilitary troops in green fatigues and police armed with batons rehearsed near orange and yellow bucket seats at the 25,000 capacity stadium. \"We have been told not to relax the security,\" match organiser Prashant Mehta said. \"There's no problem here, but we are not taking chances.\" The irrepressible Miandad, who created a stir two years ago by inviting Thackeray to Pakistan for the World Cup, had another dig at the Shiv Sena supremo. \"I hope Thackeray-sahib remembers that invitation,\" he said. \"He has not invited me this time but we are his guests and it is his duty to look after us.\" Miandad, one of Pakistan's finest batsmen, made light of a suggestion that India would prepare slow wickets to blunt his team's feared pace battery of Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar. \"Don't forget we also have some of the best spinners in Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed. We have the power to counter any wicket.\" On Thursday the 16-man squad, surrounded by gun-toting commandos, was whisked away from the airport to a downtown hotel, which resembled a fortress. Pakistan, who last played a Test on Indian soil in March 1987, will play a two-Test series, the Asian Test Championship opener against the hosts and triangular one-day series also featuring Sri Lanka. Akram, who played in the 1987 series, said he was happy to be back in a country where he had always enjoyed touring. \"I have some pleasant memories of India, but what I remember most the slow wickets,\" the lethal left-arm fast bowler said. He brushed aside a question whether recent losses to Australia and Zimbabwe and a match-fixing scandal at home will affect his team's performance. \"I have left the controversy behind at home. I am here to do a specific job and that is to win the series for Pakistan,\" said Akram, who took over from Aamir Sohail as captain for this tour. \"As for losing to Australia and Zimbabwe, even India were beaten by New Zealand, so we should be starting the series on an even note.\" Commenting on the Indian team, Akram said he respected a side that has players of the calibre of Sachin Tendulkar, Saurav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Mohammad Azharuddin. The Indian team returned from its tour of New Zealand and landed in Calcutta, instead of Bombay as originally planned, in a cloak of secrecy and tight security. It was prompted by the ransacking of the BCCI headquarters in Bombay on Monday forcing the Board to decide to shift its office to Calcutta.

{"title": "Economics and money a big concern for 1998", "body": "Money will be on a lot of minds in 1998. Asians are anxious about shoring up their humbled currencies. Europeans are debating how to give up their national money and switch to a single currency. Russians just want to make some. The world's perennial problems remain. Arabs and Jews enter another year still warily talking peace. Conflict simmers and flares across Africa. Poverty grips much of Latin America. Yet peace, however fragile, seems to be holding in some African nations long wracked by civil war. Economies are strengthening in much of the Americas. Democracy tenaciously retains its foothold in the Third World. Humankind always has been a swirl of contradictions, a producer of good and ill, and the coming year promises more of the same. The Associated Press asked some of its correspondents around the world to assess what lies ahead for 1998. Here are their reports: Asia Many Asian countries will be preoccupied with rebuilding their financial systems or trying to a stave off further currency collapses. They'll be closely watched by the United States and other nations whose markets have been roiled by Asia's economic stumble. Governments accustomed to rapid growth will have to cope with rising unemployment and the political and social tensions it produces. In Thailand and South Korea, which had the most bad debts and face the deepest recessions, outraged citizens hope newly elected governments will end the cronyism that helped produce the crisis. No such change is likely in Indonesia, also badly hit. The national assembly is expected to expand President Suharto's powers to declare a state of emergency in case economic hardship produces unrest. Japan seems to be learning from its neighbours' meltdowns and is expected to let more indebted banks and companies shut down rather than try to prop them up. Hong Kong will hold its first elections under Chinese rule. Democrats who lost legislative seats with the handover say new election rules favour pro-business and pro-China parties. Elections also are planned in the Philippines and in Cambodia, where strongman Hun Sen has quashed most opposition by force. Chinese President Jiang Zemin plans cautious moves to reorganise or close debt-ridden state industries. His main challenge will be containing protests from laid-off workers, making 1998 an unlikely year for political reform or softening on dissent. Beijing's tense relationship with Taiwan likely will be tested, if pro-independence forces on the island gain seats as expected in legislative elections. Australia may face early elections because of a deadlock in Parliament over government efforts to restrict aborigines' land rights. Europe The European Union, in one of the biggest steps toward unity in continental history, is beginning the process of joining a dozen countries in a single currency - an act as much political as it is economic. The new notes and coins won't fill cash registers until 2002, but the 15 EU leaders will decide over a long weekend in May who gets in on the first wave and the value of national currencies against the new \"euro.\"^pEastern Europe will join the unity act as well when EU enlargement negotiations open with a number of former Soviet bloc nations. Three of those nations - Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic - also anxiously await ratification of their invitations to join the 16-nations NATO military alliance. At the same time NATO is looking for ways to bring the suspicious Russians closer. Bosnia will continue to preoccupy Europeans east and west. It is virtually certain the NATO-led peace force will extend its mission past June on the widely accepted assumption that withdrawal would lead to a resumption of war. Two other clouds loom in the Balkans - between Serbs and Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo and between a Albanians and Macedonians in Macedonia. Romania and Bulgaria, left out of the first phase of NATO and EU expansion, are striving to overcome years of bad post-communist government. While Hungary seems to have righted itself, the Czechs face a protracted period of economic and political instability. Germans will decide in September whether to reward Chancellor Helmut Kohl with an unprecedented fifth term as head of Europe's most powerful economy. The opposition social Democrats are moving toward a more business-friendly posture in an effort to end the conservatives' 15-year lock on power, but they can't decide whether to challenge Kohl with a leftist or a moderate. Russia and CIS Persuading the people of former Soviet states, and Russians in particular, that reform is starting to work will again dominate the region in 1998. And stability in Russia is vital to world stability. Ask Russians to sum up in a single word what's wrong with their country. Many will say reform. Ask what they mean by reform and they start ticking off the problems: rising crime, going without pay for months, falling life expectancy. In short, many Russians think reform is the name of the chaotic system they have lived under since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. Many people in other former Soviet republics say the same thing. For all the grumbling, there are signs of progress. Russia expects to see its first economic growth since the 1980s. Individual rights are improving. And there are signs of prosperity in a few cities. Progress in most other former Soviet nations lags far behind, although Ukraine hopes to see growth in 1998. The problem, reformers say, is that decades of communist mismanagement cannot be fixed quickly. It will take years to turn Russia and its ex-Soviet neighbours into liberal democracies, but each year that passes peacefully boosts chances of success. Russia can still go wrong, and some Central Asian nations and Belarus are sliding back to autocracy. Russia's communists and nationalists hope they can ride people's disillusionment to power. Hardliners are hoping for big gains in Ukraine's parliamentary elections in March. Heading into 1998, the region is a bit more peaceful. Russia's war in Chechynya appears ended, but Tajikistan could slip back into civil war and there are worries of new fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Mideast Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat face critical decisions that will determine the direction of the Arab-Israeli peace process. Under pressure from the United States, Israel plans to offer to yield more land to the Palestinians, but it may not be enough to win back Arab confidence about Israel's overall intentions. Another key test will likely be whether Israel is willing to curtail expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which Arafat wants as part of an independent Palestinian state. For his part, Arafat will have to restrain Islamic militants and prevent suicide bombings to keep Israelis in a mood to compromise. Israel's talks with Syria are unlikely to move forward unless Netanyahu's conservative government changes its policy and agrees to a deep withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967. Iran is gaining influence in the region under the new, more moderate leadership of President Mohammad Khatami. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab states that gave a cold shoulder to the recent US-sponsored regional economic conference are now looking more warmly at the Islamic regime in Tehran. The rise of Iranian influence would likely spell an end to Washington's policy of keeping both Iran and Iraq isolated with economic and political sanctions. Islamic insurgencies still bedevil two secular Arab governments. Muslim militants in Egypt are increasingly torn between calling a unilateral cease-fire and continuing attacks that angered many Egyptians by killing more than 60 foreigners in 1997 and devastating the lucrative tourism industry. In Algeria, the government, is locked in a bitter battle with religious militants that has killed 75,000 people since 1992 and left extremists in control of pockets of the country. Latin America US President Bill Clinton plans to join Western Hemisphere leaders at April's Summit of the Americas in Chile. Free trade is at the top of the agenda. But with Clinton struggling to win support for that at home, Latin Americans are moving ahead with their own free trade zones and reduced barriers to regional commerce. The political bloodshed of the 1980s is fading into history in most of the Americas, replaced by concerns about violent crime and the seemingly eternal problem of dire poverty. Most of the region's largest countries - Argentina, Mexico and Chile among them - expect strong economic growth from free-market policies, though benefits have been slow to trickle down to the poor. Brazil was hurt by Asia's financial crisis, causing problems for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is expected to seek re-election in 1998. A more unusual race is shaping up in Venezuela, where Miss Universe 1981, Irene Saez, is considered a strong contender for the presidency. She has generally won praise as mayor of Chacao in the Caracas area. Ecuador, Paraguay and Costa Rica also will have presidential elections. Drugs and political violence continue to plague Colombia and Mexico. The leading candidate in Colombia's presidential campaign, Horacio Serpa, is distrusted by Washington because of his ties to President Ernesto Samper, accused by US officials of taking drug money to win office. But he recently said he might back legislations to let suspected drug traffickers be extradited to the United States. Colombians expect no letup in attacks by leftist rebels and paramilitary gangs that some suspect are linked to the army. Mexico still struggles with repeated crises over the influence of drug traffickers, and enters the year with two small rebel movements relatively dormant but not quelled. Caribbean Pope John Paul II's historic trip to Cuba will pose a challenge for Fidel Castro and the Roman Catholic Church, whose relations have been frosty, if not hostile, since the 1959 revolution. Castro's communist government hopes the January 21-25 visit will enhance its image by showing religious tolerance. One possible windfall: a papal denunciation of the US economic embargo of Cuba. The church, meanwhile, hopes John Paul II can galvanize believers on the island and broaden its influence among Cuba's 11 million people. Cuba officially embraced atheism in 1962, and believers suffered for their faith. Cuba wants more regional trade, and Caribbean countries are prepared to bring it back into the fold. While Washington disapproves of such moves, area leaders grumble that the US government hasn't come through with aid and scholarships promised at a regional summit last May. Look for some of those pledges to be fulfilled in 1998. The region is looking for help after the World Trade Organisation ruled in favour of a US complaint that Caribbean bananas compete unfairly in Europe. Without a hand, island farmers could turn to drug trafficking, leaders warn. As it is, the drug trade is thriving. Squeezed in Mexico, traffickers are turning to the Caribbean as a preferred trade route. Washington will be fortifying its interdiction efforts in the region in coming months. 1998 may be a watershed year for Haiti. UN peacekeepers are gone, and the government is paralyzed by infighting, putting the US-backed democratic experiment in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation at risk. Puerto Rico marks 100 years of US rule with competing commemorations by advocates of statehood, independence and the current commonwealth system. A proposed plebiscite on the island's status will be considered by Congress. Africa Four African giants - Nigeria, Congo, Sudan and South Africa - will set the continent's tone in 1998. Nigeria's dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, will attempt the transformation from iron-willed military ruler to popular politician if he goes through with August elections. Laurent-Desire Kabila, Congo's new strongman, will try to obtain much-needed aid and foreign investment while attempting to keep at bay those who call for a more open government and respect for human rights. In Sudan, President Omar El-Bashir continues to insist his Islamic-based government is sincere about allowing regional autonomy for southern Sudan. But rebels, backed by neigbouring countries and the United States, will keep chipping away at northern authority. South Africans are preparing for the day they will have to live without President Nelson Mandela. Thabo Mbeki has just replaced him as leader of the governing African National Congress and is widely expected to become president in two years. Low-level conflict continues in Rwanda, where Hutu rebels are stepping up attempts to destabilize the Tutsi-dominated government. Neighbouring Burundi likely will see more countries drop economic sanctions, but efforts are proceeding to coax its Tutsi regime and Hutu rebels into some kind of coalition government. Personal rivalries remain a threat to the stability of Charles Taylor's fragile civilian regime in Liberia, and doubts persist the military junta in Sierra Leone will keep its promise to return power to the elected government it overthrew. In Angola, Jonas Savimbi probably won't go to Luanda to fulfil his government role under the 1994 peace accord that formally ended a 19-year civil war. But international pressure is nudging his UNITA army toward giving up most of the territory and diamond fields it controls. United Nations The United Nations enters the new year with the prospect of further downsizing and downgrading as a forceful and independent global institution. Iraq and its refusal to cooperate with UN weapon inspectors remains a thorn for the 15-member Security Council. No strong action seems likely, however, with the United States and the four other council powers unable to reach a consensus on dealing with Saddam Hussein. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's efforts to restructure the organization have not been enough to persuade the United States to pay its one billion dollar in arrears. As a result, the United Nations is expected to finish 1998 with a 200 million dollar deficit in the operating budget and owing 800 million dollar to countries that have provided troops to UN peacekeeping operations. For years, the United Nations has lumbered along by borrowing from the fund used to reimburse countries for peacekeeping expenses. But as many peacekeeping operations close, that fund is dwindling. Annan has warned that new sources of cash must be found unless the United States and other major debtors start paying their bills. At the same time, the United Nations' role as an independent player in world affairs is clearly in decline. Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was denied a second term in 1996, largely because Washington resented his independence. Annan, in turn, has deferred to Washington and other major powers on such issues as sending peacekeepers to the Republic of Congo or increasing the oil revenues that Iraq can use to buy food and medicine. Annan's supporters say he has little choice. Without resources and rights of a sovereign state, he must serve the interests of the UN membership, and especially its wealthiest and strongest members. But critics argue Annan must also serve as an advocate for those without the power and the voice to influence the great powers.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/economics-and-money-a-big-concern-for-1998", "date": "1998-01-01T00:00:53+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 2461},
{"title": "SA dance to Waugh tune", "body": "SYDNEY, Jan 3: Mark Waugh blazed away with a stylish 78 as Australia set eyes on a crucial first-innings lead in the second cricket Test against South Africa on Saturday, reports AP. After Shane Warne had spun South Africa out for 287, Australia scored 174 for three before rain stopped play six minutes before scheduled stumps at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Mark Waugh, coming off twin failures of 0 and 1 in the drawn first Test in Melbourne, played one of his better innings of the season. Joined by his twin brother Steve, 18 not out, Mark opened out after being tied down by the spin twins - Pat Symcox and Paul Adams - who bowled in tandem. The fourth-wicket pair put on 71 runs in even time after coming together at 103 for three. A first-innings lead will be crucial as spin is expected to dominate the rest of the game. Leg-spinner Warne showed what the pitch was capable of, turning the ball square on the first two days. Australia, batting after lunch, lost both openers with just 59 runs on the board. But Greg Blewett, who batted for a minute under two hours for 28 runs, shared 44 runs with Mark Waugh as the third-wicket pair patiently ground out the South African attack. But the introduction of Brain McMillan after tea ended the growing stand - Blewett was out trying to drive but played on to the medium-placeman. Steve Waugh, joining brother Mark, was given a standing ovation by the 22,246 spectators in his 100th Test. Thirty-two years old Steve Waugh is only the third Australian after Allan Border's 156 and David Boon's 107 to make a century of Test appearances.Mark Waugh soon overshadowed his brother's presence with three consecutive boundaries in a McMillan over and followed it up with another in the next to reach his half-century. The elegant No 4 repeatedly used his feet against off-spinner Symcox and hit a full toss for a huge six over mid-wicket. He has so far hit nine other boundaries in his 139-minute presence. Skipper Mark Taylor (11) and his opening partner Matthew Elliott, with a confident 32, were the two batsmen dismissed in the post-lunch session. Warne went on a five-wicket spin-spree as South Africa, resuming the day on 197, for five were bowled out before lunch. Warne, 27, finished with five for 75 for a career tally of 294 wickets in 63 Tests, placing him behind Dennis Lillee's 355 in 70 games.Skipper Hansie Cronje top-scored with 88 while Shaun Pollock and Symcox contributed useful scores of 18 and 29 respectively. Cronje batted for 335 minutes and hit eight boundaries off 261 balls. He was caught at slip by his opposite number Mark Taylor, who also caught Pollock. Cronje and Pollock put on 54 for the sixth wicket, the latter being more enterprising than his first-day contribution of one run in 56 minutes. Symcox slogged 29 runs off 40 balls with five boundaries and fell to Warne, who switched ends to claim Cronje and then Paul Adams (0) to finish the innings just before lunch.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/sa-dance-to-waugh-tune", "date": "1998-01-04T00:00:45+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 516},

The three others who have thrown their hat into the ring are Asian Football Confederation vice-president Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan, former Portugal international Luis Figo and Dutch football chief Michael van Praag. Two others who had been considering making bids - former France international forward David Ginola and ex-FIFA executive official Jerome Champagne - both failed to get the necessary backing from five national associations. A FIFA statement said that the candidature dossiers would next go before the investigatory chamber of an independent Ethics Committee to carry out integrity checks on the four men within ten days. \"Upon receipt of the results of the integrity checks, the (FIFA) Ad-hoc Electoral Committee will reconvene in order to review all of the submissions and validate their compliance with the applicable FIFA regulatory provisions. \"Following this process, the Ad-hoc Electoral Committee will formally admit and declare the candidates who are eligible for the office of FIFA President.\" After that the FIFA executive committee will meet in Zurich on May 29 and decide if Blatter will get a fifth term as president or bring in a new man. The 78-year-old Swiss bureaucrat is seen as an outstanding favourite to win a new term despite a storm of protest over the way he runs the organisation. His reign has notably been tarnished by accusations of corruption stemming from the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively. The controversies have seriously eroded his support and tarnished his reputation in European strongholds like England, Germany and the Netherlands, but he still enjoys wide support in Asia, Africa and Oceania.

{"title": "Bale shines again", "body": "Gareth Bale stole the spotlight yet again as the Tottenham star inspired his side to a crucial 2-1 win over Arsenal that piled on the misery for their north London rivals on Sunday. Bale has been in sublime form of late and the Wales winger produced a typically clinical finish to break the deadlock in the first half at White Hart Lane before Aaron Lennon doubled Tottenham's lead just moments later. Tottenham Hotspur star Gareth Bale (L) fires a shot past Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky (C) during their Premier League encounter at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Photo: AFP Per Mertesacker's goal early in the second half set the stage for a tense finish, but Andre Villas-Boas's team, now unbeaten in their last 12 league games, held on to move above Chelsea into third place in the Premier League and within two points of second-placed Manchester City. Spurs have had eight managers since they last finished above Arsenal in 1995, but Villas-Boas could be the one to end that barren stretch as his side sit seven points clear of fifth placed Arsenal, who face a major struggle just to qualify for the Champions League. Arsenal's first defeat in six league games left them five points behind Chelsea in the race for a top-four finish and added to the sense of a club in crisis. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger had awoken to reports that Arsenal could be the subject of a takeover bid from a Middle East consortium which would place his future under scrutiny after eight years without a trophy and this was another dispiriting afternoon for the Frenchman. Arsenal, prompted by Jack Wilshere's intelligent passing, had been first to settle after a frantic opening and Olivier Giroud's header brought Hugo Lloris into action. Bale had few chances to flourish while Spurs struggled to find their rhythm in the opening 30 minutes and his only contribution of note was to dodge a banana thrown from the section filled with Arsenal fans. But Bale is far too dynamic a talent to be subdued for long and in the 36th minute he demonstrated the cool head and lethal finishing that sets him apart from the rest of the Premier League at present. So much of the pre-match focus had centred on Bale's remarkable form, with some pundits even mentioning him in the same breath as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and here was further evidence to support their case. Timing his run perfectly to meet Gylfi Sigurdsson's astute pass, Bale burst into the penalty area before flicking a fine finish past Wojciech Szczesny for his 24th goal of the season for club and country and his 10th in his last eight games.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bale-shines-again", "date": "2013-03-05T00:15:36+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 450},

The BNP leader came up with the remarks following media reports on the purchase of substandard Brazilian wheat. Insiders said the wheat was accepted although the suppliers failed to provide the crop year certificate and the Certificate of Standard and Quality of Wheat, issued either by Brazil's agriculture ministry or chamber of commerce. The Brazilian wheat is up for distribution among law enforcement agencies and under safety net schemes, but the police force has already complained of its poor quality along with some dealers and flour mill operators in different parts of country. On increase in depositions in Swiss banks by Bangladeshis, she said, \"Plundering of money is going on in the country.

{"title": "Match drawn in Sylhet", "body": "The three-day National Cricket League encounter between Sylhet and Rajshahi ended in a draw at the Sylhet Stadium yesterday. Rajshahi, however, managed two batting points by virtue of their massive 147-run first innings lead over the home side. On the last day, Sylhet all-rounder Saifullah Maksi, who captured six wickets for 46 runs with his off spin in the first innings, scored a fantastic hundred to take his team to a huge 309 in their second innings. Saifullah, the Pakistani recruit, scored 132, his second century of the league. He scored 173 against Chittagong in a first round match in November. In his 214-ball innings, Saifullah blasted three sixes and 14 boundaries. Rajshahi off spinner Imran Parvez was the most successful bowler of the day taking five wickets for 92 runs from his 32 overs while Medium pacer Mushfiqur Rahman, who captured seven wickets in the first innings for 33 runs completed a ten-wicket haul by bagging another three wickets for 50 runs. Rajshahi, who scored 248 in their first innings, were on 59 for 3 when the match ended. Mushfique, who also scored a magnificent 92 in the first innings, was rewarded with the man-of-the-match trophy for his awesome all-round performance. With yesterday's two points, Rajshahi raised their account to eight on completion of their ten matches and occupied the fifth position while Sylhet, who have already secured the runners up spot, remained stuck to their previous collection of 22.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/match-drawn-in-sylhet", "date": "2000-01-06T00:00:39+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 241},

With little publicity, Gore filed documents with the US Federal Election Commission late Thursday forming the Gore 2000 committee and authorising him to seek contributions, pit a campaign staff together and make campaign appearances throughout the country. The Post said Gore's move is a signal that the Tennessee Democrat was eager to fill his campaign coffers ahead of others seeking the Democratic nomination.

Senator John McCain of Arzona had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission just days before, making him the first official Republican candidate.

{"title": "New-found zeal over an age-old issue", "body": "Kyoto supporters cheer new findings that the Earth's surface temperature is probably rising. But this trend isn't recent and isn't man-made, writes Arthur B. Robinson and Noah E. Robinson Opponents of the use of coal, oil and natural gas-the world's primary energy sources-received what looked to be good news last week. A National Research Council panel of 11 members, after reviewing and evaluating existing experimental data over the last 20 years, concluded that there has probably been a rise in the Earth's surface temperature. Unfortunately for advocates of the Kyoto treaty, atmospheric temperatures over the same two decades have not risen. The climate model chosen to support the Kyoto plan - a scheme to sharply reduce energy use - predicts that atmospheric temperature should have risen by one degree to two degrees Fahrenheit over those 20 years. Yet satellites and weather balloons have shown no verifiable atmospheric temperature rise. Indeed, despite the hype, the NRC findings do little to advance the argument that people have caused global warming. The NRC panel's 85-page report, though concluding that surface temperature has risen a little, is full of inconclusive results. The first sentence of the report's concluding remarks reads: \"The various kinds of evidence examined by the panel led it to conclude that the observed disparity between the surface and lower - to mid-tropospheric (atmospheric) temperature trends during this particular 20-year period is probably at least partially real.\" The report further says that uncertainties in all of the records - surface, satellite and balloon - are too great to draw conclusions about the relative effects of volcanic eruptions, measurement errors due to localised human activity in urban areas, instrument errors, human release of greenhouse gases and other factors. The report concludes that \"major advances\" in scientific methods will be necessary before these questions can be resolved. Other findings have also been inconclusive. The Commerce Department announced that U. S. surface temperatures in 1999 were the second-warmest on record. What the department failed to mention is that it has other surface records in which 1999 falls below 1934, and that NASA ranks 1999 as the 14th-warmest-year of the century. In the global atmosphere, satellites show 12 years warmer than 1999 and 8 cooler, while weather balloons show 15 warmer and 27 cooler. All this is bad news for the anti-technologists. They desperately needed word of their long-awaited \"greenhouse signal,\" due to arrive with the new millennium. Now, in the absence of more solid proof, opposition to their global plans will continue to grow. Already, more than 17,000 American scientists have signed a petition opposing the Kyoto treaty. Treaty supporters, meanwhile, are increasingly relying on their multimillion-dollar media campaign promoting a perception of human-caused global warming. That the Earth is warming is, of course, very old news. The current warming trend began about 300 years ago, at the low point of the Little Ice Age. Indeed, receding glaciers and other geographic phenomena caused by this 300-year trend were cited by the NRC committee as support for their belief that the current rise in surface temperatures is probably real. This rising trend and the fluctuations within it are closely correlated with solar activity. Solar increases during the early 20th century caused a substantial rise in temperatures. This was followed by a cooling cycle. During this latter period, environmentalists spread doomsday scenarios about \"global cooling\" - a phenomenon, they claimed, caused by hydrocarbon fuels. Over the last 20 years, temperatures levelled, and now may be resuming their previous rise. The change has allowed the same environmentalists to spread fears of \"global warming\"-demonising, of course, hydrocarbon fuels. The chart nearby places all of this in historical perspective. Derived from isotopic ratios in the skeletons of marine organisms deposited in a region of the Atlantic Ocean, this record shows temperatures during the past three millennia. Clearly sun are the Little Ice Age and the much warmer period about 1000 years ago known as the Medieval Climate Optimum, so named because the climate was unusually benign. Earth temperatures are now near the 3,000-year average and clearly not unusual. What will temperatures be during the 21st century and beyond? No one knows. Astronomers are not yet able to predict future solar activity. If current trends continue, however, our environment will be much improved. Already, plant growth and diversity - from the forests and fields of North America to the rain forests of South America - have shown a marked increase. This is the result of carbon dioxide fertilisation, a process that occurs when man moves carbon from below-ground deposits of coal, oil and natural gas, and puts it into the atmosphere where it is then used to make more plants and animals. Some studies indicate that North American forests are growing so fast that they are storing all of the human-released carbon from North America. Animals, because they eat plants, have increased just as rapidly. When this biological miracle stabilises - one or two centuries in the future - it is estimated that the plant and animal population of the Earth may have doubled. Farm production is also being increased by carbon dioxide fertilisation, and will continue to accelerate. A warmer planet, with milder weather (as experienced during medieval times) and much more wildlife - how could a true environmentalist wish for more? Worries about flooding in this warmer world are unjustifiable. Floods did not occur 1000 years ago. Scientists have shown that it would take thousands of years for the ice caps to melt, if they melted at all. As warmer temperatures increase snow in the Polar Regions, sea levels might actually decrease. Meanwhile, short-term efforts to improve the environment, such as the plan by California's South Coast Air Quality Management District to require all public vehicles to be powered by electricity, natural gas, or other clean-burning fuels, will use more hydrocarbon fuels rather than less. Electricity - especially now that nuclear power and hydroelectric dams are considered politically incorrect - will continue to be produced primarily by burning hydrocarbons. The energy delivered to an electric car requires more hydrocarbon fuel per mile than does the direct use of hydrocarbon fuel. Our scientists and engineers have provided the technological wealth that now finances most of our environmental programmes. They will continue to do so unless pseudo-environmentalism torpedoes oureconomic progress along with the hopes and futures of billions of people in the less developed world.

Sonia Gandhi's Italian roots and her religion - a catholic in a overwhelmingly Hindu country of 960 million - have become a target in the run-up to the February-March elections. Allegations that her husband was involved in a corruption scandal, meanwhile, are also being revived. Newspapers say right-wing Hindu groups are trying to whip up emotion over the possibility of a \"foreigner\" becoming Indian prime minister. \"Let us not forget she was born in Italy,\" Acharya Giriraj Kishore of the militant Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) told AFP. \"She took almost 20 years to become a citizen of India. There is a big difference between acquired citizenship and a naturalised citizen. Therefore she is a foreigner.\"Kishore added: \"She is also a Christian, she is out to promote Christianity in our country.\"Other Hindu groups, meanwhile are joining in the attacks, including the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangha (RSS), India's most influential Hindu group and renowned for its hardline views. Political novice, Sonia Gandhi agreed to campaign for the party of her assassinated husband last month. She began her campaign last week at the site where Rajiv Gandhi was killed in 1991. Sonia, after a quiet start, attracted an impressive crowd of between 100-200,000 people to her third political rally in Hyderabad on Friday. Although BJP officials claim Sonia cannot deliver the goods for the Congress, which has been steadily losing support in recent years, they admit even a minor swing in each constituency could harm the Hindu nationalists. On her first election campaign trail, Sonia urged Indian voters today to protect India's secular fabric by voting for her Congress Party, according to AP. Addressing the fifth election meeting in the past week, Sonia Gandhi heaped criticism on a right-wing Hindu nationalist party and accused it of exploiting religion to attain 'power at any cost.'She said in her speech that upcoming elections would witness \"a clash of fundamental values, ideas and ideals.\"\"The choice is between harmony and progress and the exploitation of our differences for the sake of power at any cost,\" she said. \"Can we negate our values and heritage by converting religion into an instrument to divide?\" she asked.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bjp-steps-up-personal-attacks-against-sonia", "date": "1998-01-18T00:00:04+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 392},
{"title": "Teachers oppose new admission rule", "body": "A new admission rule for the Architecture Department of BUET has evoked strong protest from the teachers of the department. They threatened to \"pull themselves out of all activities of the varsity\" after February 2 if it is not withdrawn. The BUET authorities in a circular on Sunday made physics background \"a must\" for admission seekers in the Architecture Department. Talking to this correspondent, some teachers of the department said they will continue to oppose the new admission rule which will close the door for admission of students having humanities background. The new admission rule also violates a 35-year old practice, they said. Earlier, admission seekers in the Architecture Department had to appear at written test on Mathematics, General Knowledge and Science, English, Bangla and Free-hand Drawing, they said. The change in the admission rule was made at a recent meeting of the BUET Academic Council, with a 'note of dissent' from eight teachers who represented the Architecture Department at the meeting. Except the eight from the Architecture Department, all the 160 councillors in the Academic Council belong to the Engineering Faculty of the BUET. \"By sheer majority, this change was made without giving any consideration to the views expressed by teachers of the department concerned\", Shamsul Wares, a Professor of Architecture Department said. Nizamuddin Ahmed, another teacher of the department, also expressed the same view. Prof Nizamuddin claimed that all 23 teachers of the department oppose the change in the admission rules. BUET Vice-Chancellor Prof Iqbal Mahmud however disagreed. \"The decision was taken following an overwhelming view expressed by the Academic Council that as courses on Mechanical Engineering and Structural Engineering are also offered to students of Architecture, physics background would be beneficial,\" he told this correspondent. \"Academic Council is the ultimate decision-maker, neither me nor the Syndicate\", the VC said. \"Over the last couple of weeks, we tried our best to bring the teachers with opposing views into confidence and we will keep on trying\".", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/teachers-oppose-new-admission-rule", "date": "1998-01-28T00:00:41+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 327},

{"title": "India restore some pride", "body": "India avoided the embarrassment of 'Banglawash' when they recorded a face-saving 77-run win against Bangladesh in the third and final one-day international in Mirpur yesterday. Having conceded the first two games in embarrassing fashion against a rampant Tigers, the visitors finally achieved something to show for after their first-ever series defeat against Bangladesh. The hosts, despite the defeat in the final ODI, can look at the bright side of a memorable series against the two-time world champions. It's a series where Bangladesh presented a young left-arm pacer in Mustafizur Rahman for the world to enjoy and the vaunted Indian batting line-up to remember as a nightmare. The 19-year-old took 13 wickets in the series including two five-fors in the first two games to fashion Bangladesh's historic series success against their heavyweight neighbours in the backdrop of the World Cup quarterfinal defeat. It was also a series where the Tigers played an attractive brand of cricket and also showed the world that they had got a pace attack that was as attractive as the best in business. The final match was a test for them to try and offset what Indian batting could do. They might have failed but showed plenty of signs that it won't take them that long to match that. And they have done it in the first match. Yesterday the Tigers more than matched the pace but what they missed was a change of gear or two in the run chase. Bangladesh came up with an attacking mindset to chase down a commanding Indian total of 317-6. But the ploy did not work against a disciplined bowling. They suffered the first big blow when opener Tamim Iqbal, a suspect against incoming deliveries early in his innings, was adjudged leg-before off Dhawal Kulkarni for five. Soumya Sarkar, the other opener, gave the home side hope with a graceful 40 off 34 balls that included some eye-pleasing shots all over the park, much to the delight of the chock-a-block crowd at the home of Bangladesh's cricket. But his innings was cut short by a well-disguised slower delivery from Kulkarni. Mushfiqur Rahim looked good with 24 and Shakib Al Hasan scored an aggressive 20. But neither of the two key Bangladesh batsmen was focused on playing a big innings. Litton Das occupied the crease for quite some time but suffered a soft dismissal after scoring 34 off 40 balls. When the Tigers were reduced to 148-5, the game as a contest was all but over. Sabbir Rahman, another exciting find in Bangladesh cricket, tried his best along with a feisty Nasir Hossain. But the ideal situation could have been for them had Mushfiqur and Shakib carried till the 40th over. Sabbir struck a fluent 43 off 38 balls that included six fours and Nasir struck three boundaries in his 30-ball 32. The Tigers, in the end, managed 240 when they were bowled out in the final delivery of the 47th over. Earlier, sent into bat, a decision by Mashrafe Bin Mortaza that not many were convinced as a wise call, India cautiously stroked their way to the big total. It was a kind of score the Indian batting juggernaut has often been associated with against any opposition in the world. However, playing against three pacers after Taskin Ahmed was forced to pull out due to a late injury, India mixed caution with aggression. They were very respectful to Mustafizur, but treated an out-of- sorts Rubel Hossain and left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny with disdain. Mashrafe might have gotten three wickets but also went for 76 runs in his 10 overs. India were off to a brisk start with Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan scoring 39 runs before the pair was separated by one and only Mustafizur, who had Rohit caught behind for a run-a-ball 29. Dhawan went on to score a 73-ball 75, which featured 10 boundaries. It was the highest individual score of the Indian innings. Coming into bat at number four after yet another no-show from Virat Kohli, who ended a forgettable series after being clean bowled by Shakib for 25, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck an equally impressive 69. A subject of ferocious attack of the Indian media after two consecutive defeats, Dhoni played superbly to guide his side past the 300-mark for the first time in the series. He struck six fours and a six in his 77-ball knock. Ambati Rayudu gave his captain good company in an important 93-run fourth-wicket stand where his contribution was 44. He was unlucky to be adjudged caught behind as replays clearly suggested that the ball had hit his thigh pad. Suresh Raina entertained with a 21-ball 38 that featured three fours and two sixes. The left-hander became the world record equalling victim of Mustafizur. The youngster, who took 11 wickets in the first two games, finished the three-match series with 13 wickets to go level with Ryan Harris as the highest wicket-taker in an ODI series featuring at least three matches.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/india-restore-some-pride-102484", "date": "2015-06-25T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 832},

{"title": "Chanderpaul, Gayle tons put WI in control", "body": "Contrasting centuries by Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Chris Gayle tightened West Indies' grip over Zimbabwe on the second day of the second and final Test at Windsor Park on Thursday. At stumps, the home side were 381 for eight in reply to the visitors' first innings total of 175, a huge lead of 206. They will be pushing to complete another comprehensive victory with two days to spare -- as achieved the previous week in Barbados -- to sweep the brief series 2-0 and extend their Test match winning streak to six. Having earned honorary citizenship of the island in scoring the first Test century at the venue two years ago against India, Chanderpaul strengthened those terms of endearment with Dominicans in a five-hour vigil that was only ended by a controversial catch. His 108 occupied most of the day after Marlon Samuels fell to the first delivery of the morning. The other overnight batsman, Gayle, carried on to 101, his 15th Test hundred, an innings embellished with his usual accompaniment of powerfully-driven fours and towering sizes before he became Prosper Utseya's first Test wicket just before lunch. Utseya also accounted for Chanderpaul after the second new ball failed to provide the desired breakthrough, although the batsman could consider himself very unlucky in not being able to prolong his 28th Test hundred -- his first against Zimbabwe. Television replays showed that the ball had slipped out of Sean Williams' grasp at cover as he dived to complete the catch. Playing his 148th Test, the former West Indies captain put on 173 for the fifth wicket with Denesh Ramdin, the wicketkeeper-batsman extending his good run of form since the final Test of the tour of England last June. But he missed out on a hundred when he was trapped lbw for 86 by Graeme Cremer. The persevering leg-spinner, who went wicketless and conceded 102 runs in 20 overs in the first Test, also accounted for West Indies skipper Darren Sammy to a catch at long-on, although his final figures of two for 102 off 34 overs represented the sixth consecutive Test innings in which he had conceded over 100 runs. Utseya finished as the leading wicket-taker on the day, adding a third victim when he bowled Kemar Roach first ball following the dismissal of Chanderpaul. However, the tourists were left to rue a missed opportunity in the morning to remove the 38-year-old left-hander when he was just on 24, Hamilton Masakadza reacting slowly at leg-slip to a sharp catch off the bowling of the unlucky Cremer.

Photo: anurup kanti das Boutiques in Chittagong are dismal over dreary customer turnout with less than three weeks left to Pahela Baishakh, usually an occasion for brisk sales. What otherwise would have been a festive season, the political strife has dampened the mood, designers said. Business has been slow and orders have gone down substantially, they added. Boutiques in Chittagong like Shoilpik, Miah Bibi, Pinon, Anindya and Rowshan's see the faces of few customers in the peak buying hours of the evening. Shoilpik has seen a dip in sales in the first three months of the year, said Mohammed Elias, owner of Shoilpik, a fast expanding boutique in the port city, with 19 outlets, including three in Dhaka, The 37-year-old entrepreneur said his sales slumped by around 15 percent to 18 percent this year and never before did he feel so much sales pressure in his business life. Despite the slump, he is hoping to recoup some losses in the coming festive season and his workshop is running at full force. Embroidery and printing artisans at the factories of different boutique houses in Chittagong blame this year's low business on the ongoing political turmoil in the country. Photo: anurup kanti das He urged the politicians to find an alternative but equally effective method to press home their demands, to spare the sufferings of the common people. “The business community suffers the most during political upheavals,” said Elias, hoping there would be some sort of normalcy in the coming days so that people could visit the boutiques to shop for Pahela Baishakh. Rowshan Ara Chowdhury, owner of Rowshan's, said sales at her boutique dropped by 40 percent to around Tk 3 lakh in February, compared to the monthly average, as many days were lost to shutdowns. She dreads to see the sales figure for March as the situation was the same. Although boutiques look forward to Pahela Baishakh, which accounts for 20 percent of annual turnover, Rowshan's has trimmed production down this year, fearing lacklustre sales, said the owner of the boutique that opened 18 years ago in Dampara.

Photo: anurup kanti das She also urged politicians to keep the welfare of the masses in mind before embarking upon pro-grammes that bring businesses to a standstill. Ivy Hasan, well know for print clothing and home décor, said the festive mood is missing and orders are down by a third of usual business because of the political strife. “Customers usually opt for home décor items right before the Bangla New Year but this year there has been a noticeable reduction in orders,” she said. Sales at this time of the year usually account for 30 percent of annual sales at her boutique Doll's House, but Ivy is apprehensive about reaching that mark this year. Lutfa Sanjeeda, owner of Anindya, a boutique with two showrooms in Chittagong, said she has gloomy sales expectations. “I am not sure I can pay the wages of my workers regularly if this political situation continues,” she said. During hartals, there is hardly any production in her workshop as many workers do not show up, she added. Despite drawbacks, some boutiques have been able to keep their head above water by overcoming the odds.

{"title": "Ex-army chief enters race denouncing Netanyahu as 'dangerous for Israel'", "body": "TEL AVIV, Jan 7: Denouncing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \"dangerous for Israel\", former army chief Amnon Lipkin Shahak announced on Wednesday that he would challenge the right wing premier in May elections as the head of a new centrist party, reports AFP. Entering the political ring just two weeks after retiring from the army Lipkin Shahak told a Tel Aviv press conference he was \"Enlisting again as a citizen to defend the state of Israel against threats from within and without.\" The popular ex-general lost no time in defining the main threat as the autocratic and hardline rule of Netanyahu over the past two and a half years. But he also tired to set himself apart from Ehud Barak, head of the main opposition Labour Party and another former army chief who tried unsuccessfully to recruit Lipkin Shahak into his ranks. \"Netanyahu is dangerous for Israel, Netanyahu must leave, he declared, vowing to revive efforts to make peace with the country's Arab neighbours. \"Today there is neither security nor peace\" he said in a barbed reference to Netanyahu's 1996 campaign promise to bring peace with security. Turning to Labour, Lipkin Shahak said the party which ruled Israel for much of its history represented the economic and political elite. A political novice but with experience as a negotiator with the Palestinians and Syria, Lipkin Shahak, 54, is credited in opinion polls with an outside chance of toppling Netanyahu, 49. But many analysts question whether he can weather the rigors of a more than four month election campaign and he combined fire from right and left which was quick in coming on Wednesday. Netanyahu's office issued a scathing statement denouncing Lipkin Shahak as \"the chief of staff of obtuseness\" who had no clear policy positions. \"The people are waiting for some clear words from Amnon Lipkin Shahak about his political ideas said the statement. Netanyahu was forced into early elections after his right wing coalition collapsed last month in large part over the stalled peace process with the Palestinians. Netanyahu now faces a host of challengers from the left and right, including several defectors form his own Likud party, in a race which analysts consider wide open. Recent opinion polls show that, while Lipkin Shahak is the best placed candidate to beat Netanyahu if the election for prime minister goes to a second round runoff, he has little chance of reaching the second round against both Netanyahu and Barak. In hopes that prolonged public exposure will dull Lipkin Shahak's popularity, the two mainstream politicians agreed to hold off the new elections until May 17. In a bid to dispel criticism of his lack of political programme, Lipkin Shahak spelt out his position on Israel's ailing economy and the major issues in the peace process in a television interview later in the day. Implicitly backing a Palestinian state, he accused those, like Netanyahu, who are implacably opposed to statehood of missing the point. \"Such a state already exist on the ground,\" he told the privately run Channel Two television, \"but as Israelis we can only give this state our approval if it meets our security needs and for that we have to negotiate.\" He conceded that \"there will be a territorial compromise with the Palestinians in any final peace settlement it's clear that some (Jewish) settlements pose a problem he said. He also said he was willing to make territorial concessions on the annexed Golan Heights in order to achieve peace with Syria and Lebanon, although he added there would be \"no going back\" to the borders before Israel's 1967 capture of the territory from Syria. But throughout the day he was swift to counter Netanyahu's charges that he would give up control over East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope to make the capital of a future state. Lipkin Shahak named no other members of his as yet unnamed party. But he expressed confidence he could forge an alliance with a powerful former member of Netanyahu's Likud party, Dan Meridor, who last month announced he would also create a centrist group and run for prime minister. It is obvious that there will not be two centrist candidates for prime minister we have to decide between us who will run, he said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/ex-army-chief-enters-race-denouncing-netanyahu-as-dangerous-for-israel", "date": "1999-01-08T00:00:10+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 708},

President Bush, who has branded the communist state part of an \"axis of evil\" along with Iraq and Iran, said Monday he remained open to dialogue but White House officials said the North must first end efforts to develop atomic weapons. Pyongyang's KCNA news agency denounced the United States' brief seizure last month of a shipload of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen, calling it \"part of the US-tailored containment strategy against the DPRK (North Korea). \"The strategy means total economic sanctions aimed at isolating and stifling the DPRK,\" the agency said Tuesday. \"Sanctions mean a war and the war knows no mercy. The US should opt for dialogue with the DPRK, not for war, clearly aware that it will have to pay a very high price for such reckless acts,\" KCNA added. A South Korean presidential envoy headed to Washington on Tuesday in a fresh bid to defuse the crisis. National security adviser Yim Sung-joon, was expected to suggest that the United States give North Korea security assurances and promises to resume energy supplies in return for the North abandoning its nuclear program. The UN nuclear watchdog, meanwhile, gave Pyongyang a last chance to readmit inspectors expelled last week. Meeting in Vienna the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution warning North Korea to cooperate with its inspectors or be reported to the UN Security Council for breaching nuclear safeguards. A South Korean official said the international community backed the ultimatum from the IAEA. \"Basically, the IAEA's decision reflects the international community's unified voice and we hope that North Korea will take the message,\" said Kim Moon-hwan, from Seoul's foreign ministry. Tension has risen on the Korean peninsula since late December when North Korea expelled the agency's inspectors and fired up a reactor mothballed in 1994 when it agreed to end such work in exchange for oil from the United States and its allies. Washington insists that the North end its quest for nuclear weapons. A defiant Pyongyang countered with a demand that the United States, which keeps thousands of troops in the South, sign a non-aggression pact. Bush said Monday the United States would talk with North Korea but a White House official said dialogue could start only after the North dismantles its weapon programs. \"We'll have dialogue.

{"title": "DESA turns a deaf ear", "body": "Financial performance of Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) has not improved despite an earlier warning that it would be merged back with the Power Development Board (PDB) if it failed to reduce system loss and its arrears with PDB by July this year, sources said. With its ever-increasing arrears with PDB, now at over Tk. 1800 crore, DESA came under fire in recent months from the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy, Finance Ministry, Energy Ministry, PDB and World Bank-led donors. Still, DESA's system loss remained almost static at 25-26 per cent for long. System loss is responsible for a loss of over Tk 350 crore a year in the power sector. About half of the system loss is due to 'theft' of power by consumers in connivance with a section of employees of PDB and DESA, the sources said. Though DESA authorities took some measures against some meter readers and ledger writers in recent months for their involvement in power pilferage, there has been no significant improvement in the performance. \"In the last six months, the PDB authorities took some measures to improve its performance. DESA has also introduced some measures,\" said a source in the PDB. PDB has more than Tk 2500 crore arrears due from DESA and other clients, which is equivalent to its 17 -18 months' billing. However, some top officials of PDB are also considering a second option. \"If DESA continues to perform poorly, it might be converted into a subsidiary of PDB instead of merger. It would be easier to implement this concept,\" the source added. DESA is also not serious about paying PDB's monthly bills. Normally, PDB charges a monthly bill of around Tk. 100 crore from DESA for the power sold to it. \"But DESA seldom pays more than Tk 50 crore a month. Moreover, It did not pay bills for over three months last year,\" said the source. Different types of clients including government offices and industries owe DESA over Tk 1400 crore. \"If every thing was in order in DESA, it would have made a profit of over Tk 20 crore a month,\" the source noted. PDB continues to issue letters to DESA in \"strong language\" to improve its performance and pay the arrears by raising its bill collection to over 120 per cent (against the total billing). The PDB had fixed a target to reduce the system loss to 18-19 per cent from 23 per cent by January and raise the collection-generation ratio to over 100 per cent from last year's 85 peer cent. But despite serious efforts, PDB's system loss could be reduced by only one per cent and it stood at 22 per cent in December. \"However, the collection-generation ratio increased significantly last month,\" the source said. Corruption is so deep rooted in DESA that even transfer of some unscrupulous employees has not produced any significant result, he added. \"The root of all evils is the present billing system\". To remove it, the authorities are now working on a plan to introduce computerised billing system in the city, he said. \"Already computerised billing has been introduced in PDB which has 10 lakh clients. It has now computerised billing system for over 70,000 clients in Chittagong, Kushtia and Comilla. By the end of December this year, about two lakh clients will be brought under computerised billing system.\" In addition, PDB has introduced a number of reform measures to improve its performance. It has converted its six power distribution zones into \"Strategic Business Units\" under which there are 20 District Circles. All these circles will now work as separate \"Cost and Profit Centres\", each having separate assets. Besides, PDB has formed Clients' Service Association at the level of its' 250 Electric Supply Units across the country. Headed by a PDB Resident Engineer, these associations have deputy commissioners and people from thanas as members. The members meet every month and submit their complaints and suggestions to improve PDB's performance. \"All these reform measures have become vital for the existence of PDB. Donors are pressing the government to abolish PDB by separating its components as its overall performance continued to deteriorate over decades,\" observed a power expert. \"By improving PDB's performance and making it a profit earning entity by 2003, PDB wants to prove that the public sector can perform well.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/desa-turns-a-deaf-ear", "date": "2000-01-24T00:00:43+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 721},

{"title": "Tigers fall to Herath heroics", "body": "Mohammad Ashraful, centurion in the first Test, gets run out cheaply in the morning session of the second Test at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo yesterday. The dismissal proved costly as Bangladesh got bowled out for 240. PHOTO: AFP It's always risky to predict the outcome of a Test after the first day's play, especially as the Tigers' strong comeback in the Galle Test have made many wary of writing them off, but it was far from an ideal start for the visitors in the series-deciding second Test at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday. After a run-fest in the first Test, the Bangladesh batting were found wanting against Sri Lanka, with another good half-century from Mominul Haque being the exception. On a pitch that was supposed to favour the seamers, evidenced by both teams including three pace bowlers in the final eleven, Rangana Herath's five-wicket haul spun the tourists out for 240. If the wicket deceived both teams, the sluggish outfield came as a shock for the visitors on the first day. The wicket was more sporting than the placid track in Galle but it was not as spicy as expected. After pacer Nuwan Kulasekara drew first blood by trapping Tamim Iqbal in front, Bangladesh succumbed to the left-arm spin of Herath, who completed his 15th five-for to put Sri Lanka in a good position in what has turned into a do-or-die game for the hosts to salvage some pride against the Tigers,. Tamim's poor comeback, another wasted start by Tamim Iqbal, a continuation of Mahmudullah Riyad's bad shot selection and Mushfiqur Rahim's length misjudgement in the last delivery before the tea break all combined to dispel the promise of another good batting performance by the visitors, but in the end the team most rued a run-out. It seemed that the responsibility and patience Mohammad Ashraful showed in Galle was not a one-match wonder after the way the right-hander seemed to set his stall for another long innings. His determined batting with Jahurul saw Bangladesh recovering from the early loss of Tamim to defy the Sri Lanka attack on a sporting track, but his careful 47-ball 16 went in vain as he was run out attempting a quick single when Jahurul called him for an impossible single after tapping the ball towards mid-on, from where Shaminda Eranga did the most useful job for his side. When Ashraful and Jahurul were comfortably negotiating both pace and spin, many questioned whether deciding to bowl was the wisest move by Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews, but when Bangladesh lost half their side for only 155 by tea, it was all but confirmed that the day would belong to the home side. The total however might have been bigger as the sluggish outfield also contributed to keeping the score down, with only twelve boundaries in the Bangladesh innings. Jahurul was the most affected as some good hits stopped short of the boundary. Bangladesh had to be satisfied with three on eight occasions – hits that would otherwise have been boundaries on any good outfield. After the departure of Ashraful, young left-hander Mominul joined Jahurul to lay a platform but their association lasted for 49 runs as Jahurul offered a simple catch to the wicketkeeper, after which Bangladesh lost wickets at regular interval. Mominul, in only his second Test, looked the most confident out in the middle on way to his second half-century in consecutive innings before Herath was lucky to have him caught behind. Mominul made 64 off 98 balls that featured three boundaries while Nasir Hossain's usual late surge and Shohag Gazi's crucial 32 helped the team to finish with a decent total. Nasir was last out for 87-ball 48, a fine rearguard that featured two fours and a six. Pacer Robiul Islam, who was playing his fourth Test after making his debut at Lord's in 2010, provided some solace by having Tillakaratne Dilshan caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur as Sri Lanka ended the day on 18 for one.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/tigers-fall-to-herath-heroics", "date": "2013-03-17T01:03:35+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 666},
{"title": "Globalisation: The South's Prospects", "body": "Humanity has achieved phenomenal, revolutionary progress in all fields of human endeavour, particularly over the past 50 years or so. But that progress has not touched a large majority of the global population. What might be the future scenario? It is argued that, by globalising, i.e. by integrating into the world capitalist system led by the advanced western countries, viz. the USA and other OECD countries in Europe and elsewhere, the poor countries, which lost out in the past, will gain access to benefits of global progress and will thereby be enabled to achieve rapid economic and human development. How real are the prospects for the poor countries in the present unipolar highly iniquitous global system? The western countries shape their international trade relations as well as their stance and posture in international organisations in accordance with their own strategic and commercial interests. The on-going globalisation focuses on free market trading of goods and services and movement of capital, in both of which the developed countries hold the pre-eminent position; but free movement of labour which the developing countries can export in large numbers is not allowed. Also, non-tariff barriers restrict export of goods and services from developing to developed countries, contrary to the imperatives of global free market economics. Obviously, this is a globalisation of which the dynamics are stacked against the interests of the developing countries. Then, there are the multinational corporations (MNCs) and transnational corporations (TNCs) originating in the West which hold a large deal of the cards in international business, industry and finance; each of the MNCs and TNCs plays its share of the deal with a view to maximising its profits and corporate power globally, which is precisely what their basic mission is as business operations. Surely, they cannot be faulted for pursuing their legitimate mission. But, the strategies they employ in pursuing that mission and the attitude they adopt regarding social responsibilities give rise to controversies. In the on-going globalisation process, the participating developing countries need, invite and facilitate (by offering incentives of various kinds and degrees) foreign direct investments (FDIs). Because of their eagerness, consequent upon their urgent need coupled with political exigencies, to attract FDIs, they often may sign contracts or offer incentives and facilities to MNCs and TNCs, which are of dubious pay-off for them in the short run and even detrimental to their interest in the long run. The issues to contend with include MNC and TNC attitude toward and willingness to accommodate the host country's short and long run interests, whether the MNCs bring in funds from outside or raise funds from local capital markets, whether or not they use internal pricing mechanisms (over-pricing when importing from its branches in other countries and under-pricing when exporting to other country branches) to reduce the taxable corporate income, whether they are interested in exploiting cheap labour and natural resources in host countries without regard to the consequent social and environmental costs imposed, and whether or not polluting industries are being relocated in the developing countries. Much, of course, depends on the host country's ability to articulate its interests and negotiate terms on that basis; but these are precisely the tasks the developing countries are often ill-equipped to handle, not only because of technical capacity limitation but also because of corruption on both sides. For example, contractual obligations entered into by the Government of Bangladesh with the fertiliser company KAFCO including the supply of gas to KAFCO at very low prices, and production sharing contracts with gas drilling and lifting companies such that the Government of Bangladesh would buy the share of gas allocated to a company at international prices to be paid in foreign currency (US dollars) are subject to serious question from the point of view of Bangladesh's interests. It is therefore essential that while offering incentives and facilities to MNCs and TNCs and entering into contracts with them in respect of particular industries, contractual terms are carefully formulated and appropriate regulatory provisions are put in place and applied strictly, keeping in sharp focus the interests of the country. Studies have shown that country after country of the South, having opted for and pursuing global integration, has failed to gain much. Even the economies of the East and South-east Asian tigers are now shattered. Reckless expansion of business, banking operations, and construction works based on borrowed western money, without having regard to what might happen if the debts were called in, has been at the root of this bubble-burst. The governments of those counties failed to keep track of what was happening, and there was no preparation for dealing with such a large-scale withdrawal of funds. Preoccupied with being 'tigers', these countries failed to equip themselves with strong banking institutions and good corporate governance under effective regulatory systems. There is a lot to learn from the East and South-east Asian experiences - from the way these countries achieved phenomenal economic growth over the past two decades or more and the reasons behind their present currency crisis and economic turmoil. The share market debacle in Bangladesh in late 1996/early 1997 is also a pointer to the currency related risks that free market and globalisation could entail, unless adequate regulatory safeguards are in place and properly implemented. One must therefore ask which globalisation is it that a country is pursuing? Who globalises or integrates with whom? Who gains, who loses? What are the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a globalising developing country to face developments such as those encountered by the East and South-east Asian countries. For gaining on a sustained basis, experiences around the world seem to indicate that a country must build into its globalising process the imperatives arising from the socio-economic realities prevailing in the country and establish effective regulatory systems to ensure good and responsible corporate governance on the part of both domestic and foreign companies operating in different sectors - productive, financial or trading. This must be done as the reform process is pursued; otherwise, there may lurk in the background a big jolt and a huge disillusionment. I am not against economic reforms or globalisation, but my concern is with the safeguarding of the reforming developing country's interests in the process so that no disillusionment and chaotic consequences may engulf it in future. The pathway to an integration into the global system for a developing country, defined by the currently ruling paradigm of economic reforms, contains both opportunities and dangers. In order for Bangladesh to make the most of the opportunities and to put in place necessary safeguards against the dangers, it is imperative that the reform process in Bangladesh is reshaped by building into it the realities on the ground (high levels of poverty and unemployment; severe environmental degradation; low level of human capability development; agriculture and potential industries requiring support for progress, and in cases even for survival; etc). Also, if globalisation were to work for the developing countries, upon which it is enjoined on the argument that it is to their benefit, the advanced countries should be more forthcoming than hitherto to work towards establishing an equitable world system. Indeed, if all nations of the world, advanced and developing, were to move together as an integrated global society in an orderly fashion, there is no shortcut to finding an appropriate solution to the problem of the persisting glaring inequity among nations and among population groups within nations. Otherwise, i.e. under the business-as-usual scenario in terms of the currently ruling paradigm, the future of the global order cannot but be a mirror image of the present, only worse. The scenario, depicting as it does increasing inequity and contradictions between developed countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other, with the latter at the wrong end, cannot be morally and ethically justified. Clearly, the paradigm underpinning this scenario cannot be sustained over the long run unchallenged and without having to face serious backlash and upheavals. At the country level also, most developing countries, which are implementing the reforms as prescribed, face moral/ethical quagmires and practical unsustainability. The message is loud and clear in both global and national contexts - which is: to mend ways or face the inevitable consequences alluded to above.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/globalisation-the-souths-prospects", "date": "1999-01-05T00:00:54+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1370},

{"title": "Iqbal's bail prayer rejected, sent to jail", "body": "Former Awami League lawmaker Dr HBM Iqbal, an accused in connection with the Malibagh killings on February 13, 2001, was sent to the Dhaka Central Jail yesterday, after his bail petition was rejected. Iqbal, along with his lawyers advocates Abdul Baset Majumder, Kamrul Islam, and Jahangir Hossain Selim, appeared before the Speedy Trial Tribunal, Dhaka Division at 10.30am yesterday and sought bail. The lawyers stated that Iqbal obtained ad-interim bail from the High Court (HC) and he did not misuse the privilege of bail. Moreover, he was not an FIR-named accused in the case, and in the first charge sheet, submitted by the police on July 12, 2001, his name was not included. \"So he should be enlarged on bail,\" the lawyers argued. Special public prosecutor Abdul Latif Talukder opposed the bail petition, stating that the accused petitioner was granted ad-interim bail by the HC following the incident, but he did not furnish the bail bond in support of it till yesterday. It was a violation of the HC order. He quoted newspaper reports to establish that Iqbal's petition for extension of the ad-interim bail had been rejected by the HC, as he did not furnish the bail bond. So, he prayed for rejection of the bail petition of Iqbal. After hearing both the sides, judge Shahed Noor Uddin rejected the bail petition and sent Iqbal to the Dhaka Central Jail. In its order, the court said the Investigation Officer (IO) of the case had earlier submitted a charge sheet against Iqbal and 23 others. He did not find any ground to grant bail to Iqbal at this stage. So he rejected the bail petition and sent him (Iqbal) to jail. Five other accused, Kabir Uddin Ahmed, Mohammad Nurunnabi Chowdhury, Himu alias Tareq Shams, Kamrul Morshed Khoka and Kamruzzaman were granted bail when they appeared in the court yesterday and sought bail, while the lawyers of two other accused, Abul Bashar and Shawkat Hossain Nannu, submitted two separate petitions seeking time. All the accused was on bail by the High Court. Accused Kiron, Dulal alias Laundry Dulal, Imdadul Haq alias Bachchu, Moniruzzaman alias Liton, Monir Hossain and Pichchi Hannan are still at large, while Abdul Halim, Golam Mostafa alias Pappu, Babul alias Kala Babul, and Abdus Salam are now in jail custody. Accused Liakat, GM Ziaul Haq Shameem, Mohammad Jasimuddin, SM Arman, Khorshed Alam and Kamrul Hannan alias Hannan were earlier granted bail by the HC, but they were absent from the trial court yesterday. The court issued summons upon the aforesaid accused to appear in the court on January 27. The court also fixed January 27 for hearing on charge framing against the accused in the case. In the case filed with the Motijheel Police Station, on February 13, 201, it was alleged that four persons, including a policeman were killed, and four others wounded when activists of the then ruling Awami League opened fire on an opposition procession in the city's Malibagh during a hartal. The four-party opposition alliance had called the hartal, demanding immediate resignation of the AL government. The case was filed against more than 150 people, including Iqbal. But the then IO of the case had submitted a charge sheet against only five persons, excluding Iqbal on July 12, 2001. When the four-party alliance came to power, the home ministry ordered further investigation into the case. Following the investigation, 19 more people, including Iqbal, were chargesheeted on December 31,2002. It may be mentioned here that Iqbal was granted ad-interim bail by the HC on March 4, 2001 and his bail was extended a few times. But this time, his bail bond was not furnished to the District Magistrate, Dhaka. Meanwhile, the HC on Monday rejected the petition seeking extension of Iqbal's ad-interim bail, as he did not follow the HC order. Moreover, his counsel Barrister Rokon Uddin Mahmud showed his apathy towards conducting the case on his behalf.

{"title": "Uncertain Election Scene", "body": "THE electoral campaign has been practically reduced to Atal Bihari Vajpayee versus Sonia Gandhi. In a way, it is between the Bhartiya Janta Party and Congress. True, regional parties are there, trying to hold their territory. But the real fight is confined to the BJP and Congress for the simple reason that there is no other viable political party in most of the northern India states. As of today, there is no wave, for or against any party, either in a state or in the country on the whole. Never before - India has witnessed 11 Lok Sabha elections since Independence - has the outcome been so unpredictable. It is more or less a toss-up. Yet, one thing is certain that neither Congress nor the BJP, nor the combination of the Janata Dal, the communists and their allies, will be anywhere near a majority. That it will be a hung parliament as it was in 1989 and 1996 is a foregone conclusion. But this time the members will be more dispersed than before. A coalition will take some time to anvil. The UF may comprise of 20-odd parties, instead of 14 as is its present strength. In fact, in the last 14 years since 1984 when Congress secured 411 seats in the 543-member house, no party has secured a majority in the Lok Sabha. In the 1991 election, Congress won only 232 seats but it swelled its number through defection and deceit. This time, too, all political parties will be well short of 272, the required strength to form the government. Still, both Congress and the BJP claim 200 each. Arithmetically, this is not possible. Both may not reach the number. While Congress has flimsy existence in UP, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Punjab, constituting 226 seats, the BJP is in not-too-happy position in eastern and southern India, which embrace 155 seats. Congress, which was at one time ahead of the BJP, suffered a serious jolt in 1996 in the wake of a revolt in Tamil Nadu. This time it will be affected by the stirrings in West Bengal. Congress, despite the Sonia Gandhi factor, is a divided house. Many official candidates will be sabotaged by those who have been denied tickets. The BJP has also its share of dissidence. Gujarat is one example. The intervention by the RSS, the BJP's mentor, has brought about discipline of sorts. But unity is only on surface. Madya Pradesh still torments the party. The Janata Dal, once emerging as the third force, is disintegrating. The exit of former Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and the death of Biju Patnaik in Orissa have hit the party beyond redemption. Its expelled stalwart from Karnataka, Ramakrishna Hegde, may not win more than five seats but he will cut into the Janata votes and bring down the party's present Lok Sabha strength of 46. If ever the political situation is retrieved, the credit will go to the communists, who may string different regional parties together to keep Congress and the BJP out of power. The problem with the third force or the national front is that it has primarily existed on paper. It never achieved cohesiveness or credibility. There is wide disillusionment with it. All the three combinations have, however, realised that caste identities have eclipsed religious identities. Therefore, the caste factor has become more important than before. Muslims believe that their community will pick the winning candidate of any party against the BJP's. Where they may go wrong is the feeling of resignation, which is overpowering Muslims in certain areas, and which is goading them to try even the BJP. Their argument is that it may not turn out to be worse alternative to other parties for which they have been voting so far. Therefore, in the face of non-descript options, the election looks like an exercise which the voters, perforce, will go over. They continue to be indifferent and cynical. And whatever enthusiasm was there, it has been squeezed out by the selection of candidates. Some of them have a criminal background. Some have defected from their parent body to get nomination. And some are there by the dint of money. Congress beats them all. It is not bothered about cleanliness. It has adopted the same old faces, which carry the stain of hawala on their khadi. At the last minute, some parties have changed the names of their candidates because of the diktat by the mafia or the moneybag. Perhaps, India should develop a method whereby a party holds an election, like primaries in the US, to find out who among its candidates has the largest following in a particular constituency. At present, only the party president counts in parties other than the BJP, which is at the beck and call of RSS, and Congress, which is dictated by Sonia Gandhi. Such being the material, the structure that may emerge cannot be but faulty. It is too early to say which party will be part of which structure. But there is no doubting about its ricketiness. It may collapse after one year or so, necessitating a mid-term poll. One cannot put the blame on the candidates because they reflect the type of leadership a party has. The criterion for political parties is loyalty, not merit. I know of several persons who were not given tickets because they are too bright, too straightforward, too clean. One party chief has even spelled out his aversion: \"The educated create problems and it is better to leave them out.\"Yet, this does not explain why there has been so much splitting in parties this time. Even the most loyal have taken no time to cross over to other side or form their own group. The units have broken and rebroken. There is no sanctity of the party as such. There are several reasons for it. One, parties are not related to any policy or programme. Two, the quality of leaders or, what is called the high command, has got diluted so much that it does not evoke respect, much less awe. Leaders are not tall enough. Nor have they any base to impress the members. Circumstances seem to have thrown them up and most of them do not deserve the position to which they have reached. Even the most leading ones are connected with dubious business houses or mafia groups. Their word has lost moral authority. Another reason is the weakening of institutions. Apart from the media, parliament or the state legislatures, there are no other forums which have any clout. Indira Gandhi was the one who destroyed the institutions because she wanted to wield power all by herself. Rajiv Gandhi, of even lesser mettle, did not understand what the institutions meant. Narasimha Rao knew their importance but did not retrieve them because it would have been at the expense his own authority. In the absence of institutions, it is not surprising that persons, who seek to make any contribution, want to be in parliament or the state legislature. This atmosphere has affected all activities, politics the most. The media is the real villain. Its obsession with politicians has crowded out the intellectuals, the professionals and even the activists. It is not a happy situation. It only adds to confusion. All becomes tentative. But uncertain politics does not mean an unstable system. There will be pulls and pressures, even horse-trading, but all within the precincts of the system. Those who know India will not be unduly perturbed even if the polls do not throw up any single party or person to lead. Italy had 63 coalitions in the last 50 years, India only three or four during the same period. Political stability does not have anything to do with unstable parliament. Indians are beginning to understand it. Foreigners will do so in due course and shed their fear in investing in India.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/uncertain-election-scene", "date": "1998-02-04T00:00:33+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1313},
{"title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise", "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

{"title": "AL-BNP talks must to rid politics of criminals", "body": "Senior politicians, intellectuals and noted citizens at a seminar yesterday called for dialogue between the two major political parties to free the country from \"criminalised and confrontational politics\". The present state of politics has made parliament virtually non-functional, democracy meaningless and economic activity crime-based, pushing the entire society towards ruination, they said. Making overtures to Deputy Leader of the Opposition Abdul Hamid Advocate at the seminar, ruling BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan assured the opposition of floor in parliament and said it has to be effective to resolve all disputes. There is no alternative to holding regular discussions and reaching a consensus on all national issues, he said. Responding, former Speaker Hamid said, \"There should be understanding and communication between the two major political parties\". Gono Forum leader Dr. Kamal Hossain, Workers Party leader Rashed Khan Menon, Prof Anisur Rahman, The Daily Star Editor Mahfuz Anam also spoke at the seminar on 'Society, Economy and Politics'. Dhaka University teacher Dr Abul Barkat, General Secretary of Bangladesh Economic Association (BEA), presented the key-note paper at the seminar. FBCCI President Yussuf Abdullah Haroon also presented a paper. BAE President Dr Kazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad chaired the morning session of the seminar, jointly organised by FBCCI and BEA. It was held at the Osmany Auditorium in the city. Bhuiyan, who attended the seminar as chief guest said, \"We are caught somewhere in a crime syndrome. We have to think how to come out of this and achieve rapid development\". He said, \"We have to make parliament a place to discuss everything. Then street-based politics will disappear,\" he said. Bhuiyan also suggested lowering the election expenditure for eliminating crime from politics and society. \"If election expenditure is less, political leaders would not extract toll from businessmen.\" Dependence on foreign aid is also one of the causes for spread of black money and crime in the society and in the administration, he said. He blamed the previous Awami League regime for sheltering some \"warlords like Iqbal, Joinal Hazari and Shameem Osman, who created a ring of terror in the country\". Bhuiyan strongly denied giving any shelter to such terrorists by the present government. Abdul Hamid accused the ruling party of not giving the opposition enough time in parliament and of trying to \"downsize\" it. He warned the ruling party about the consequence of having two-thirds majority in parliament. \"Having two-thirds majority in parliament was never good in South Asian politics,\" Hamid said. He also criticised the government for arresting prominent writers and journalists including Muntasir Mamun and Shahriar Kabir. Dr. Kamal Hossian said those who destroyed the economy and business had been rewarded. He does not see any possibility of formation of an independent anti-corruption commission in the existing system. He underscored the need for freeing politics from corruption and black money. In his key-note paper Dr. Abul Barkat, said in the last 30 years, the main socio- economic trend in the country has been \"criminalisation of economic activity and politics\". \"The fate of 13.90 crore people of the country is hostage in the hands of about one million people, who have institutionalised crime and corruption. \"Industrialisation and welfare of the people are impossible unless we come out from the crime circle\". Mahfuz Anam urged political parties to start a \"new politics\" in the country on the basis of full democratic norms. He did not see much difference between the leadership in the two major political parties which ruled the country after recovery of democracy. Mahfuz Anam said democratic atmosphere is not flourishing due to lack of communication between the two major parties. He said the country has immense potentials for development but political parties could not utilise the opportunities just after the independence and after the democratic movement in 1990. Dr. Kholiquzzaman Ahmad informed the seminar that the BEA has taken an initiative to arrange a dialogue between the two top political leaders of the country.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/al-bnp-talks-must-to-rid-politics-of-criminals", "date": "2003-01-03T00:00:06+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 652},

The government has taken adequate preparations to implement the decision. The Traffic Department of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) will deploy 66 mobile and stationary units of policemen to ensure that none of the remaining 6,575 two-stroke polluters can ply streets.The decision to finally ban the polluters was the outcome of a long-drawn campaign by the media, protest from the general public and environmentalists. And finally a High Court ruling hit the last nail into the two-stroke coffin. In 1995, the Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (BELA) and the Bangladesh Legal Aid Services Trust (BLAST) filed a public interest litigation with the High Court for establishing citizens' rights to breathe fresh air. In 1996, the Awami League (AL) government also took an initiative to ban the polluters. The Auto-rickshaw Owners and Drivers Association had a two-month talks with the government regarding the ban. And finally, the government backed out from its decision despite getting popular support for the move. Later, the AL government increased duty on spares of two-stroke vehicles by 200 per cent. But the whole exercise turned futile when the government allowed import of a huge number of polluters through one of the state-owned banks. Later, following a writ by BELA and the BLAST, the High Court passed an order on March 27, 2002, which included eight directives to the different departments of the government. Banning the polluters was one of them. Following the High Court order, the government banned 12,500 two-stroke three-wheelers in the first phase on September 1. Only 6,575 polluters were allowed to ply the city roads till December 31. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), the auto-rickshaws popularly known as 'baby taxi' were first introduced in the city in 1955 and in 1978, auto-tempos came. In 1955, only 25 auto-rickshaws were launched. Meantime, with the ban in effect from today, owners were seen shipping their vehicles to small towns. The Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) will deploy some alternative vehicles in the city streets to reduce the sufferings of the commuters because of the ban. The BRTC will introduce some 200 human haulers, 500 CNG-run auto-rickshaws, 50 taxicabs, and 500 Chinese four-stroke three-wheelers this month.

State Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury, addressing the inaugural function of a five-day training course on \"Maintenance technology of industrial sewing machines\" at Sonargaon hotel as the chief guest, said Japan, from the very beginning, is our valuable, dependable and trusted partner in development. Bangabandhu Jamuna Bridge is a bright example of Japan's support to nation building activities, he added. Chowdhury said Japan had extended its tremendous support to the Liberation War in 1971 when the nation jumped to the war at the call of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The minister hoped that such efforts by Japan could play a greater role in developing human resources, transferring technology as well as reaching further understanding about with whom the nation's ties are deeply rooted. The Association overseas Technical Scholarship (AOTS), Japan, organised the course in collaboration with Brother Industries Ltd, Japan, Brother International Singapore, Brother Bangladesh Liaison Office, Bangladesh, AOTS Alumni Society (BAAS) and Chittagong AOTS Alumni Society (CAAS). The opening ceremony was also addressed by Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) representative Daisuke Arai, AOTS representative Dr. Moazzem Hussain, Brother Industries representative K.

Three Japanese experts - Yutaka Yamamoto Akio Soga and Lee Cheo Tiang - are conducting the five-day-long technical sessions, being joined by 40 participants from different garment industries. The minister said Bangladesh had already made an impressive strive in the garments sector and hoped that Brother with its commitment to improve would take further entrepreneurial ventures for the development of human resources in Bangladesh. Daisuke Arai said for a balanced global trade, JETRO encourages imports from Japan and supports strengthening trade and industries with other countries. Keeping this in view Arai said JETRO has set up 80 offices in almost all over the world. He said since 1973 JETRO Dhaka office is actively involved in supporting the entrepreneurs in various ways so that they can uplift the standard of products to meet the demand of the world market including Japan. Like the European and American markets, Bangladesh can also penetrate into Japanese markets through maintaining quality and taste of the local people, the JETRO representative said. Dr. Moazzem Hussain said AOTS since its establishment in 1959 under the Japanese Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI) has been continuing world wide human resources development trading programme in Japan and overseas. It has so far trained about 90,000 persons in Japan including 850 from Bangladesh. Besides, it also trained more than 85,000 persons in overseas including about 1,900 in Bangladesh. The AOTS representative hoped the participants would exploit maximum possible knowledge and skill from this course and utilize the same for their respective organisations.

{"title": "This Bill is Dangerous: Another View", "body": "I was taken aback by the editorial in your paper of 28 January, 2000 on the Public Safety Bill tabled in the Parliament. I am taking the liberty of addressing this letter to you because I have confidence in your fairness and objectivity. I would leave it to your readers to decide whether your remarks are ill-judged but these are certainly biased observations. The problem of law and order is not new. It has plagued the country for a long time and both the last government as well as the present government tried to deal with the problem in their own ways. One of my first columns in your esteemed paper was written on this subject in 1992. The BNP government enacted the Anti-Terrorist Act to cope with this menace. The present government has introduced a similar law but with significant difference. I would have been happy if you paused and pondered on the rationale for such successive efforts before launching a bitter attack. Obviously you failed to notice the difference between the present bill and the Act which was passed and used by the previous government. Nor have you given adequate thought to the human rights of those who lose their life or limb or their property. I would like to submit to you that the present bill is a remarkable improvement over the earlier effort made by the BNP government. You are no doubt fully aware of the circumstances in which both the BNP government and now the Awami League government felt the need to strengthen the provisions of the law to effectively deal with the law and order situation. Criminal activities in general but terrorism, mugging and extortion in particular have become a serious problem for the law abiding citizens of the country. The business community has been clamouring about it. The present government has taken the initiative to smash the criminal gangs which were operating with impunity in the south-west districts of the country. The bold and thorough cleansing operation in those districts had earned the government appreciation and gratitude of the millions of citizens who were helpless hostages to these criminal gangs. The government moved firmly and achieved remarkable success. There can thus be no question about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's commitment and determination to combat this evil. She is equally determined to root out crime from the urban centres but the nature of the problems are different and there are a number of difficulties in the way. The most important of these difficulties is the delay in the trial and punishment of the accused criminals. Notorious terrorists with several murder charges are set free on bail. Regardless of the seriousness of the crime, the trial takes years and years. Guilt is never established and the guilty goes unpunished. On the one hand, the authorities are frustrated because criminals cannot be punished and on the other hand, criminals are encouraged because law-enforcing agencies are seemingly helpless either to keep them behind the bar for any length of time or to get the trial completed within a reasonable time. This is, undoubtedly, the crux of the problem. The bill introduced by the government in the House addresses these problems. I wish to invite your attention to some of the significant features of the bill. We can surely judge these points on the basis of the common yardstick of our understanding of public interest. * First, the accused will have the right of appeal to the High Court. The right to appeal to the highest court of the country removes in one stroke whatever reservations one may have had about fundamental human rights. * There is no death penalty in the present bill. The law passed by BNP had provisions from death penalty. * Bail can be granted under the proposed law though it has been made more difficult. * The enquiries must be completed within one month which can be extended by 15 days and by another 30 days under special circumstances. Once the trial begins, it will continue uninterrupted till the verdict is given. * The trial must be completed with 90 days but under certain special circumstances, within 120 days. * The punishment for false accusation will be 7 years of jail term. You will see Mr. Editor, that the thrust of the bill is on speedy enquiry and trial. It addresses a precise weak point of the existing law which tends to prolong the proceedings and causes inordinate delay. Having considered these features of the bill one would inevitably come to the conclusion that the net result of the changes made in the new law will shorten the enquiry and trial period. You will no doubt agree with the adage that justice delayed is justice denied. The bill aims at ensuring justice within a reasonable period of time. Apart from shortening the enquiry and trial period, there are really no basic changes from the existing law. The letter will become too long if I go into all the features of the proposed law. I am certainly not an expert on the subject but we all know that while crime remains embedded in human nature, the manner in which it is committed changes with the passage of time. Extortion by using terror tactics is a somewhat recent phenomenon in our society. Destroying cars and other vehicles by setting them on fire is also a recent phenomenon. Throwing acid on women by men was unheard of when we were young. The new bill proposes to deal with all these rather recently devised forms of crime usually found in urban centres in Bangladesh. It is also an attempt to ensure justice to those who are victims of terrorism, extortion and wanton violence. I hope your readers will not form a hasty opinion on a bill which has been drafted with utmost care in order to deal with the urban crime which seems to have become a major constraint in our economic and social development effort. Why should it be seen as an attempt to muzzle the Opposition? Surely you are not suggesting that we should permit opposition activists to commit terrorism in the name of democracy? Should the present ruling party go into opposition, they should not fear this law because this law is aimed at terrorists and not on lawful activities of a political party. I shall be grateful if you will be kind enough to publish this letter in your esteemed paper. This will, I hope, give your readers an opportunity to see the other side of the coin which your editorial seems to have neglected. Why should you not believe that the government is making a sincere and genuine effort to give the people respite from the terrorists?

{"title": "Acid violence", "body": "The first verdict under the Acid Crime Control Act, 2002, sentencing one person to death for attack on two young men, points to the state's seriousness about the rise in acid violence which is welcome and reassuring. If sustained, such administrative and judicial activism will certainly result in decline of acid violence. The incident also points to a change of trend of pattern in acid crime, which an Acid Survivors Foundation survey substantiates: women are no longer exclusive victims of the heinous act. The survey puts the percentage of male victims of acid crime at 35, up from 17 in 1999. The crime is no longer in the domain to dejected lovers but has spread over to land dispute, personal enmity and village politics. Nevertheless, beyond the statistical nitty-gritty and trend-changes, the fact remains that acid crime is very much there and on an exponential rise. According to the survey, 483 people fell victim to acid violence last year. As this paper has pointed out many times before, the culture of impunity, given birth to by years of enforcement failure, encourages upswing of crime of every kind, from petty theft to horrific homicide. The male targeting in acid crime is only a manifestation of the phenomenon. Materially, however, there will have to be an effective monitoring of the sale and use of acid. We hope the tribunal's verdict is the first of such exemplary punishment to perpetrators still awaiting trial. The judiciary has recently expeditiously disposed of a number of sensational murder, rape and harassment cases. The sentence on the acid criminal certainly adds a feather to the country's criminal justice system. The judiciary has proved that if the law enforcement and prosecution wings of the state do their job, the former can dispose of cases in the shortest possible time. This should be a milestone in dealing with cases that have hung fire for years.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/acid-violence", "date": "2003-01-19T00:00:44+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 316},

{"title": "IMF says wiping out poverty key challenge in new millennium", "body": "International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Michael Camdessus said today a key challenge in the new millennium was the need for \"an unwavering focus\" on poverty reduction, reports AFP. The reduction of poverty was \"even more daunting and urgent challenge\" than the prevention of financial crises in a world of closely-linked capital markets, Camdessus said in a special article he contributed to Singapore's Straits Times newspaper. He urged the advanced countries to live up to their pledges of assistance and reinforce their actions in poverty eradication by opening their doors wider to exports from poor countries. Camdessus said the challenge of poverty was not confined just to the countries that, in per capita terms, qualify for debt relief and concessional lending. He pointed out that one of the sad truths of the financial crisis which broke out in mid-1997 and swept through emerging market economies was \"the most vulnerable members of those societies bore the heaviest burden.\" \"Thus, it is essential that governments in these countries - supported by the international community - maintain their commitment to social-safety-net programmes to ensure that everybody is able to weather the storm,\" said the IMF chief who is scheduled to step down mid-February after nearly 13 years in office. He said some 1.3 billion people live on less than one US dollar a day in the world's poorest countries. Camdessus said there was every reason to believe the coming decades would bring material benefits to hundreds of millions more people, and bold steps should be made to improve human conditions throughout the world. \"But this will require an unwavering focus on poverty reduction. \"And for the world to be able to maintain and develop it, it will be essential the new millennium be marked by renewed commitment to stability through strengthened policy discipline in the framework of the new financial architecture,\" Camdessus explained. The IMF is in the forefront of efforts to devise the new financial architecture that can help prevent a repeat of the financial crisis which plunged most of Asia into recession. Camdessus said perhaps the most important lesson of the 1990s was the world was now confronted by a new and more complex breed of financial crisis, \"which can be prevented only if we continue to tackle the shortcomings of the global financial system.\" He said the rapid rebound of the emerging market economies from the depths of the crisis underlined the benefits of a world tied together by open markets, freer capital flows and international policy cooperation. But uncertainties continued to hang over the world economy and it was essential to avoid complacency, he warned. Camdessus said financial systems in several of the crisis-hit countries remained burdened by bad debts and added corporate restructuring still had a long way to go if these economies were to regain their health fully.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/imf-says-wiping-out-poverty-key-challenge-in-new-millennium", "date": "2000-01-01T00:00:24+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 471},
{"title": "Sky is the limit for the garments' sector", "body": "Undoubtedly the most rejoicing matter after the independence of the country is the success story of ready-made garment (RMG) sector which could uplift the fates of millions of Bangladeshi people over three decades. The journey of the sector which started in early 80's of the last century is still on its full momentum for a steep growth. Broadly, the sector could make thousands of successful entrepreneurs, millions of skilled workers and the sector helped put the economy on a firm footing through contributing 80 percent in the national export basket. Having such a steady and robust export growth, grabbing more market pie globally the World Trade Organisation (WTO) declared Bangladesh as the second largest apparel supplying country worldwide in 2010. Bangladesh now claims 4.8 percent of the global RMG trade of $412 billion. According to McKinsey & Company, an international management consulting firm, Bangladesh's apparel exports will reach $36 billion by 2020. Some key market players believe that the country's potential is even greater. But, such a position is not created in a day or two, it is the relentless journey of three decades. The garment industry is a national asset now. The industry has reached such an envious position for the concerted efforts of millions of workers, entrepreneurs and governments. The sector is still facing some challenges. Some of the major challenges as follows: Confrontational political situation The first victim of confrontational politics is the garment sector as the exporters face challenges in production, marketing, distribution of raw materials, destruction of factories by the enraged political party supporters. The activities of the sector stop for the confrontational politics. Workers cannot move up to the factories during political chaos like shutdown and political impasses. Even, during the latest spell of shutdown, almost all 5,500 garment factories suffered shipment hassle as the goods laden trucks could not go out of the factories for violent political situation across the country. In case of delayed shipment, the factory owners have to face the orders cancellation from the international buyers, expensive air shipment, demurrage and delayed payment. So, political stabilisation is the utmost need for highest export earning garment sector. Perennial gas and power crisis: Inadequate supply of gas and power to the industrial units has become a perennial problem now. For inadequate supply of gas and power the industry owners have no choice but to run the factories with expensive diesel run generators for running the factories. Moreover, the government has suspended giving new gas connection to the industrial units since mid of 2010 on the excuse of exploration of new gas wells across the country. Many mainly composite garment units are failing to start production only for the lack of gas connections in the factories, although those were constructed a lot earlier. Garment makers are saying that they have the orders in their hands as those are shifting from China to Bangladesh. The optimistic exporters are saying that only sky is the limit for Bangladeshi garment items. China, the largest apparel supplying country worldwide, is losing its share globally for price competitiveness and shortage of workers and shifting to high-end technologies. Poor infrastructure problem: With inadequate supply of gas and power, the poor infrastructures became a major challenge for the ready-made garment (RMG) sector. Poor road communication and a messy traffic system have made the sector vulnerable. The Dhaka-Chittagong highway, through which country's 80 percent exports and imports are carried out, is still is a bad shape. There has been delay in the works of expansion of the road to four lanes. The goods laden vehicles have to stand for hours in the traffic jam on the way to Chittagong from Dhaka and its adjacent areas for poor road. Many garment exporters complained that they cannot meet the strict lead-time set by the international buyers for delayed shipment in Chittagong port due to poor road condition. Dearth of skilled workforce Three decades old garment sector is now suffering from 25 percent shortage of skilled workers as the country could not arrange vocational and technical education system for the workers. According to industry insiders currently 3.5 million workers are directly employed in the sector where 80 percent are women. Grooming a strong mid-level management for handling such a big sector is another big challenge for sustenance. The training system is still very inadequate. Most of the workers get in job training. As result, they are less productive and the rate of internal migration of workers in the garment sector is higher. Very few workers had the opportunities to have the training before joining in their services. Since, the rate of productivity from the unskilled and semi-skilled workforce, the owners depend on quantity of workforce for optimum level of production. Crisis of industrial land Many local and foreign investors are not getting adequate land for establishing industries for scarcity of land even at higher prices. It will be very difficult to get a suitable industrial plot in the Dhaka-Mymensingh, Savar, Ashulia, Narayanganj and Narsingdi industrial belts for setting up new industrial units. Marketing and price negotiation problem Majority of the first generation garment entrepreneurs did not start their business with formal education. They started their business normally and got bigger later, although the second generation is very organised. So price negotiation, which is very vital for sustenance of business, remained unattended to many. It is widely believed that the export of garment would have become more had the Bangladeshi exporters got the exact market price for the sold items from the international buyers. The prices for per dozen garment items remained stuck at $26.50 over the last three years although the cost of production increased nearly 15 percent year-on-year. Price negotiation is still a major problem. For having such a poor price negotiation capacity, a section entrepreneur felt encouraged for price cut and unhealthy price competition in the domestic market. Inefficient port operations Chittagong port is the most vital link for businesses in Bangladesh. Until now, this port cannot attain the global standards in operation. The ships have to wait for long days for unloading for inefficient port management. Automatic system should be introduced in the port for quickening the export-import businesses. Crisis of raw cotton and yarn Bangladesh is totally dependent on imported raw cotton and yarn as the country does not produce the two basic items for garment manufacturing. The garment manufacturers have to spend more than billion US dollars every year for importing raw cotton. But, sometimes, the uncertainty in availability of raw cotton in global markets hampers the production and prices of finished garment items. In 2010, the local cotton importers had to import this white fibre at $2.50 per pound which was sold at $60 cents earlier for decades. It happened so for prediction of lower production of raw cotton worldwide. But, later the prices came down to a tolerable. Inefficient economic diplomacy Nowadays it is acknowledged by all that strong economic diplomacy means strong businesses. Until now many Bangladeshi missions abroad fail to achieve the target in export of Bangladeshi products. It happens so only for inefficient economic diplomacy. Not only this, the government's right foreign relationship in right time helps to gain advantages in overseas trade. Suppose, in Bangladesh countries demand for Bangladeshi garment items is very high, but Bangladesh cannot penetrate over there for the lack of bad or for not having bilateral relations with those countries. As for example, the Russian market and some Latin American markets have great potentials for Bangladeshi garment items. It needs proper initiatives from the government and private sector entrepreneurs to grab the opportunities in those markets. Shortage of fashion designers and lack of education system Introduction of new fashion is called the heat of garment products. But, unfortunately, Bangladesh does not have skilled manpower in this important segment of garment production. This is because, Bangladesh did not established educational institutions for imparting such important lesson to the learners. As a result, Bangladeshi designers cannot claim any unique design although the country became the second largest apparel supplying country worldwide. Still, Bangladesh has to depend on supplied design from the international customers. External trade related factors and the row over GSP scheme Bangladesh will have to keep a regular watch on the international changes in financial sector as the garment business is an international trade. The export of Bangladesh's garment remained insulated from the biggest financial crisis in the western world in 2007 and 2008. This was possible only for the country's basic garment production. But, Bangladesh can take an advantage from financial risk as well if the country's entrepreneurs keep close watch on customers' behaviours. Because, people started changing their tastes with rebounding of the economy. If Bangladesh can replenish the production the country will be able to export more now in the not only traditional markets, but also to new export destinations. Very often, the zero-duty benefits under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) issue comes under attacks from different countries. Currently, the GSP in the US market is under threat on labour standard. The US the single largest export destination for Bangladeshi garment items. Bangladesh annually exports more than $5billion garment items to the US market. So cancellation of GSP will have a negative impact on export of garment items to the US. If the US cancels the GSP, the other countries like the EU may be influenced from such decision. So, the government should handle such a situation very carefully. Compliances and standards of labour Compliance is very important factor in garment business now. The products will have to produce following the internationally standard compliances, like ensuring workers' welfare, timely payment, production protecting the environmental degradation. The standards of labour should be enhanced. The garment makers will have to take the green initiatives in production cycle. Fire safety should be improved to avert any further Tazreen tragedy. Shifting from basic to high-valued garment items Time has come to reap the dividends of three decades' hard works by the entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs will have to produce high-end garment items for upscale customers. But, it is a challenge as well for lack of skilled workers and designers. At the same time the more the country export more value added items the more the country will be benefited. Tariff, the backward integration, non-tariff and para-tariff barriers Tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff barriers are major challenges for garment trade. Some countries have high tariff, for which the exporters cannot gain the benefit from the export. Like South Africa and Russia have higher tariff on export of garment items from Bangladesh. On other hand, Bangladesh has to face a lot of para-tariff and non-tariff hassles in export of garment items to India, although Indian government has already allowed duty-free export of almost all products from Bangladesh excepting 25 drug and alcoholic beverages. So, the government should negotiate to remove such barriers in garment export. New export destination Finding new destinations is really a big challenge for Bangladeshi garment items. All markets are considered as new destinations excepting the US, the EU and Canada. Bangladesh has a lot of potentials in India, South Africa, South Korea, China, Malaysia, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Russia and Turkey. But challenges remained in exploration of those markets. Corruption and higher bank interest rate Corruption is a major challenge for Bangladesh. The corruption in garment sector is also a major challenge like Hall-Mark loan scandal. The company has embezzled Tk 26,00 crore the Sonali Bank branch at Ruposhi Bangla Hotel with showing fake documents. As a result, the other commercial banks are not showing interest lending money to the entrepreneurs. Higher bank interest rate is another major challenge for garment sector in Bangladesh. Bangladesh enters 2013 with a firm footing as the world's second largest garment exporter, raising hopes for a new wave of business despite turbulent times in parts of the globe. Bangladesh has the potential to grab more market share in near future, but the country will have to address those challenges first. ...........................................................................................

India trail the three-match series 1-0 following their four-wicket defeat in the second Test in Wellington. \"We have to get the runs on the board quickly,\" Gaekwad said. \"It is a very good pitch and the only way we can win from here is by getting our nose in front and then applying the pressure.\" Gaekwad was critical of the batting when he said it was \"disappointing.\" \"Our batsmen got good starts but didn't apply themselves long enough to get big scores,\" he said. \"It is a type of surface that needs a fair amount of discipline. The New Zealand batsmen showed that when they batted.\" Tendulkar, who followed up his innings of 47 and 113 in the second Test with a breezy 67 off just 93 balls, was adjudged lbw by New Zealand umpire Doug Cowie. Cowie, who had turned down numerous appeals in the New Zealand innings, had rejected a confident shout for lbw off the previous ball. Television replays clearly showed the ball which dismissed Tendulkar, a full length delivery from medium paceman Dion Nash, was drifting down leg side. Nash and his fellow bowlers were at the receiving end as the batting brilliance of Tendulkar and Dravid dominated the afternoon session after New Zealand had been dismissed 11 minutes after lunch. After India had lost openers Navjot Sidhu (1) and Ajay Jadeja (12) in the space of seven balls, the third wicket pair hit 19 boundaries between them and a six to Tendulkar as they raced to 109 in two hours before Nash checked India's progress. Tendulkar's 20th half century in his 64th Test threatened to overshadow a remarkable batting recovery by New Zealand after they had been sent in. The right-handed Dravid refused to be overshadowed by Tendulkar's presence and matched the former captain's aggression cutting and driving for most of his 19 boundaries. Simon Doull, the chief destroyer in the second Test with a nine-wicket haul, removed Ganguly (11) with a well disguised slow ball which was duly edged to first slip Stephen Fleming. In the penultimate over of the day, Azharuddin (4) drove loosely at Chris Cairns to give Fleming another catch. It was Srinath's third five-wicket haul in his 35th Test and his first since claiming 5-104 against South Africa at the Wanderers in January 1997.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bad-luck-for-tendulkar", "date": "1999-01-04T00:00:47+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 513},
{"title": "Indian Airlines privatisation faces uphill task", "body": "NEW DELHI, Jan 28: The privatisations of India's state-run domestic carrier Indian Airlines could prove and uphill struggle, with private carriers cold to the idea of being a strategic partner with no management control, says AFP. \"The government's decision to privatise in brilliant,\" said Yash Kohli of private Indian carrier Modiluft Ltd, which voluntarily grounded itself in 1997 due to a liquidity crisis, but hopes to resume operations this year. \"But, it has drawn up its privatisation plans without paying any heed to some basic and practical investor concerns,\" Kohli said. The government took a cabinet decision on Tuesday to privatise Indian Airlines by shedding 51 per cent of its stake. The cabinet said 26 per cent of the stake divested would be sold to a strategic partner, with the remainder going to Indian Airlines employees, financial institutions and the public. \"Indian Airlines will face difficulties in finding a strategic partner,\" Modiluft's Kohli said. \"No one will be willing to take a minority equity stake in the airline with the government still firmly in management control with 49 per cent equity.\" India's two major private players in the domestic aviation market, Jet Airways and Sahara Airlines, seemed equally wary. \"Indian Airlines is terrible overstaffed and bogged down with an ageing fleet,\" said a senior executive at Jet Airways. \"A strategic partner will want to shake things up and bring in professional management. But you can't do that if the government only wants you on board as a moneybag.\" No foreign airline would be allowed to bid for the 26 per cent equity, although expatriate Indians and overseas corporate bodies can bid for the stake. Aviation expert G Ganapathy Subramaniam said that \"with no strategic partner in sight\" it was unlikely that the privatisation would be finalised before the government's deadlines of March 31, 2001. Subramaniam said \"downsizing and better profitability\" would be necessary to make the equity more attractive. Market analysts said the 25 per cent public offering may also run into difficulties. \"An Indian Airlines maiden share offering to the public will not find too many subscribers,\" said analyst Arjun Kapur of ARK Securities Limited. \"The state-run carrier suffers from a painful legacy of being sluggish. It will have to be more profitable to grab investor interest.\" After making loses for three years in a row, Indian Airlines posted a net profit of 42 million rupees (977,000 dollar) against a budgeted loss of 100 million rupees in the five months to August 1999. During the same period in the previous year, it made losses of 230 million rupees. \"Indian Airlines will have to show it can make consistent profits to convince small primary market investors to pick up its stock,\" said Kapur. Yash Kohli of Modiluft said she hoped the move would be a precursor to the privatisations of the state-run international carrier Air India.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/indian-airlines-privatisation-faces-uphill-task", "date": "2000-01-29T00:00:54+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 476},

{"title": "Children in jail", "body": "More than 400 children are languishing in the Dhaka Central Jail -- an extremely disquieting piece of news that. When the adult inmates of jails in the country, many of whom under-trial prisoners, live in subhuman conditions, it is a gross violation of basic human norms. But when under-aged prisoners are shabbily treated it mocks at the very core of the justice system. Their best years are being spoilt through culpable negligence of the state. A report carried by a Bangla daily shows that the legal process is also not proceeding smoothly when it comes to the so-called juvenile delinquents. The issue should be examined in all its ramifications, if only because it has a great bearing on a section of poor children, who end up in jail for some reason or the other, It is difficult to believe that all of them have been meted out a kind of treatment that only hardened criminals could deserve. The truth is they are victims of circumstances. The street boys are often engaged in various activities in which the element of risk is very high. They are deployed as picketers, and hired to help drug runners and illegal dealers of explosives. When a crime is committed, police can easily arrest the street boys. But the men behind the scene who deploy them are never brought to book. In fact, they not only perpetrate culpable crimes but also make sure that the under-aged boys finally become scapegoats. If the decision-makers have any qualms about the budding lives being wasted in the dungeons of a veritable hell, euphemistically called jail, they must not allow the real culprits to go unpunished. The handling of the issue by police should also improve vastly. The boys are often shown as much older than they actually are, to fulfil the legal requirements. Again, nothing can be more inhuman than prosecuting anybody on the basis of facts and figures that are concocted. The rights of children should not be reduced to intangible ideas suitable only for academic discussions. The government should immediately find out the actual number of the imprisoned children, send them to the penitentiary if that is what a particular case demands, and ensure speedy disposal of the cases about children.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/children-in-jail", "date": "2003-01-05T00:00:47+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 374},

Security forces put the number of dead at 103 and said 70 others had been injured, including two soldiers. Authorities are known to underestimate death tolls in massacres and other violence wracking Algeria since 1992. The two separate attacks yesterday evening about 20 kms (12 miles) from Algiers were the bloodiest in the Algiers region since a series of attacks in August and September that left hundreds dead. Violence around Algeria stepped up with the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, on December 30. At least 600 people were reported killed in two waves of attacks in mountain hamlets in western Algeria. According to medical sources at several Algiers hospitals, 120 people were killed and 100 others injured in the Sunday night attacks in a public room used to show movies in the village of Sidi Ahmed and in a mosque in Haouche Sahraoui. In each case, bombs were set off at the start of the attacks. The statement by security forces, carried by the state-run APS news agency, said that self-defence groups armed by the government and security forces helped push back the attackers at Sidi Ahmed. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest attacks, but suspicion fell on Islamic insurgents whose battle to topple the military-backed government was moving into its seventh year.

{"title": "Millions of children risk deadly diseases in developing nations", "body": "ANAHEIM, California, Jan 25: Millions of children risk disease and death because they live in badly polluted cities, a report issued on Sunday finds, reports Reuters. The report, by the Washington-based World Resources Institute, lists the 10 cities in the world with the worst air pollution and finds nine out of 10 of them in China. The fifth-worst city is in India. The worst is Lanzhou, in Gansu province in northwestern China. The region has a large petrochemical industry and oil refineries. \"As a consequence of the emissions from these industries, the city rarely experiences a clear day,\" the report, released at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says. The study, funded by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the US Environmental Protection Agency and other groups, looked at three measurements of air pollution - Total Suspended Particulates (TSPs), Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Dioxide. These are taken to be good indicators of pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels. WHO guidelines say the maximum permissible amount of TSPs is 90 micrograms per cubic litre of air, according to the report, Lanzhou has more than 700. The next worst city, Jilin, has close to that, while Taiyuan has nearly 600. The effects on health are devastating, Devra Lee Davis, an epidemiologist who led the study, told a news conference. \"Most children who live in large cities in the developing world breathe air that is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarette's a day,\" Davis said. The problem is that these cities have rapidly growing economies but old-fashioned technology. \"While development is welcome, the fact that it occurs in areas with technology... that is 30 or 40 years old... places all the populations of these cities at risk,\" she said. \"Cars in Beijing meet 1970 US standards.\" But she said the Chinese government had recognised the problem and was moving to upgrade buses, cars and trucks to cleaner standards. \"Improving energy efficiency will have a major effect,\" she said. The report says developing countries should be helped to clean up their cars, factories and other polluters before it is too late. Developed countries, although many are still polluted, have benefitted from cleaner technology. \"If these pollution-reduction technologies are made more readily available to developing countries, these could help them avoid the high risks to public health that result from current patterns of growth in their industrial and urban sectors,\" the report says. \"Since most of the transportation and power generating plants of developing countries will be acquired during the next few decades, the health of children and of all urban residents can be markedly protected if these newly acquired systems employ more efficient and less polluting technologies,\" Children are more at risk because they breathe faster and because their lungs are still developing and thus more susceptible, the report says, citing several studies. Pollution has been shown to damage the cilia in the airways - the tiny hairs that sweep out pollutants and invaders. Without the cilia, harmful chemicals can get deep into lung tissue and cause permanent damage, Davis said. To make matters worse, leaded gasoline is still used in many countries, and several studies have shown that lead from fuel emissions ends up in children's bodies. Lead can cause brain damage, retard growth and, in extreme cases, kill. The 10 cities listed in the report, in descending order of TSP levels, are Lanzhou, Jiling, Taiyuan, Jiaozuo and Rajkot.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/millions-of-children-risk-deadly-diseases-in-developing-nations", "date": "1999-01-26T00:00:53+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 575},

Photo: AFP Barcelona pulled off a remarkable Champions League comeback when Lionel Messi struck twice in a thrilling 4-0 home win over AC Milan on Tuesday that sent the Spaniards through to the last eight 4-2 on aggregate. Trailing from last month's last 16, first leg at the San Siro, Barca were ahead in the fifth minute at a raucous Nou Camp thanks to Messi's brilliant curling effort and the World Player of the Year levelled the tie on aggregate five minutes before halftime with a powerful low drive. Barca ruthlessly dominated the Italians, who struggled to get the ball out of their own half for long periods, and David Villa struck a third for the hosts 10 minutes after the break before Jordi Alba killed off Milan with a breakaway goal in the second minute of added time. Barca are the first team in the Champions League to ever overturn a two-goal first leg deficit without the benefit of an away goal while only four sides had successfully fought back from a deficit of more than one goal. Fired-up Barca, roared on by almost 90,000 supporters inside their giant arena, harried and hassled Milan from the start. The early goal they desperately needed arrived when Messi exchanged passes with Xavi on the edge of the Milan area and curled a brilliant shot into the top corner that left goalkeeper Christian Abbiati rooted to the spot. Milan were under increasing pressure and Abbiati palmed an Iniesta volley against the crossbar eight minutes later before a long-range Xavi strike flew narrowly wide. Barca's intensity dipped as the half wore on and Milan came within a whisker of snatching the goal that would have meant the hosts needed to score at least three times to go through. Barcelona centre back Javier Mascherano misjudged a header and Milan striker M'Baye Niang raced clear but his low shot crashed back off the post with home keeper Victor Valdes beaten. Moments later Barca doubled their lead on the night and drew level at 2-2 on aggregate. Andres Iniesta won the ball in midfield and fed Messi who smashed a low drive past Abbiati from just outside the penalty area. Barca continued to dominate in the second half and Villa justified his inclusion in the starting lineup when Xavi sent him clear on the right and he struck a perfect left-foot shot high into the corner. The Spain forward made way for Alexis Sanchez 15 minutes from time and it was the Chilean who set up Alba to fire home Barca's fourth which eased the tension among the home fans and killed off Milan's hopes. The Serie A side had pressed forward looking for the goal that would have sent them through but Barca held out to keep alive their dream of a third European crown in five years.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/barca-return", "date": "2013-03-14T00:00:21+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 547},

{"title": "What is Google doing?", "body": "A few years ago, web thinker Jeff Jarvis published homage to the world's most successful Web search and advertising company titled “What Would Google Do?” These days, the question seems to be, “What is Google doing?” Google won us over with a revolutionary approach to Web search that made its predecessors seem archaic. It quickly toppled Yahoo as the coolest company on the planet based solely on its efficient and fast way of finding everyone else's content. Now, though, Google is something entirely different. What is Google doing? I'm not sure. There may well be a great, bumper-sticker answer. But Google's actions are too chaotic to come up with a grand, unified theory. It's toying with apps, mobile software, mobile hardware, mobile phones and, oh yeah, still dabbles in Web services it decides with zero discussion to terminate with extreme prejudice. It's one thing to be pulled in all directions as a dance partner, it's another to have it happen on some carnival ride. Search has turned out to be only Google's opening gambit. It still owns just under 70 percent of search market share, and because of that reach about 40 percent of online advertising. For some companies that would be enough, this one, near-perfect service. But Google had bigger ambitions than merely imposing order on the Internet's chaos. We got a hint of Google's plans in 2006, when it paid $1.65 billion -- what was its largest acquisition to date -- for YouTube. It also gave us Gmail and Google Docs, which dramatically changed users' attachment to the cloud and boosted their own productivity. A bunch of honest tries, like Wave & Buzz, followed early misfires in collaboration and social networking. But for all of Google's innovation and experimentation, it started to feel like Lucy and the football. Rather than keeping what resonated, Google seemed to abruptly end services we had found useful, and had even come to depend on. It shuttered Google Health, a service that maintained all your medical information, and Google 411, a voice-activated directory service. Part of the problem is our own unhealthy addiction to “free” software. Who doesn't want a free service like Google Docs? But another issue is that Google has been not so much using the crowd as abusing it. It goes public with too many things and, even worse, gives up on some that worked, could have worked and did exactly what Google presumably wanted: cultivating dedicated users who grew to depend on them. And that is where cultivating and banking goodwill come in. The trick when you're disrupting yourself is to bring everyone who loves you along for the new ride without making it seem like you're a shadow of your former self even if you are. Facebook managed it, reversing course from the most exclusive network in the world to the least. Apple did it, moving from the “something for everyone” model before Steve Jobs came back from exile to “Think Different.” The last straw for many was Google's surprise decision last week to kill Reader, the seven-year-old RSS service that brought RSS into the mainstream. James Fallows makes the case for becoming wary of Google's very reliability. How, he asks, can you allow yourself to possibly trust Google when the company is so cavalier? After Reader's demise, many people noted the danger of ever relying on a company's free offerings. When a company is charging money for a product … as Evernote does for all above its most basic service, and same for Dropbox and SugarSync you understand its incentive for sticking with that product. The company itself might fail, but as long as it's in business it's unlikely just to get bored and walk away, as Google has from so many experiments. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 39 times, shame on me. (My Reuters colleague Jack Shafer also has thoughts on Reader.) So what is Google up to? Is it a forward-thinking company that embraces its customers as partners or uses them as focus groups it later ignores? In recent years, Google has started doing things that aren't very Google. It flopped in an attempt to market a mobile phone -- the Nexus One -- but then purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. Why? It has nothing to show for it except shedding more than 5,000 employees. If it intends to mount an NFC takeover with a slew of iPhone-killing, Google Wallet-empowered Motorola Phones, then Google is better at keeping secrets than Apple. It has partnered with a number of hardware manufacturers to kick-start the netbook business with their bespoke Chrome operating system. (I positively reviewed both the low-end and high-end models.) But the Chromebooks are selling worse that Microsoft Surface hybrids (which I didn't like) and that's saying something. Project Glass, Google's entry into Minority Report eyeware, gets lots of attention -- and frankly seems very cool -- but as a mainstream consumer device it seems eons away at best. When did Google become a hardware company? I missed that memo. Change is scary, but necessary. But explaining the changes that are going to come is a necessary part of doing responsible, do-no-evil business. Google has never been particularly good about customer relations seriously, did you buy a Nexus One? What it also isn't good at is bringing us -- the users -- along. Without projecting a clear idea of what it is really up to -- and what's in it for us in the long run -- the company risks the onset of Google Fatigue, especially when there are good or better alternatives to almost everything Google does. Google's best move would be to define itself, bringing order to its chaos. There's a perfect opportunity right around the corner: Google I/O, the company's annual developer's conference, in mid-May. I'm saving the date to my Google Calendar right now.

{"title": "Public Administration Reform", "body": "The DS report under the heading of \"Ex-bureaucrats oppose extension of service\" published on the 11th January, 1999 made quite an interesting reading. It may not be well known that there must have been at least 1000 various commissions/committees, some for reform and others for inquiry, since the Liberation. Expect the bureaucrats, has anyone else seen these reports or know of the measures taken in response to the recommendations of the-se commissions/committees? As for the current administrative reform, I am sure it would make an interesting reading if one could get hold of the Report if and when it is made available. Leaving that expectation aside, the current concerns of the persons involved are quite revealing, as reported. One must not forget that these administrative reform commissions are always formed with very senior, experienced, top level bureaucrats and they consort with similarly situated persons, as the list of those attending the meeting indicates. The underlying assumptions are quite clear. First, the bureaucrats are in the best position to know the real problems of governance. Secondly, they clearly have the best notions about the ways and means to resolved the problems. What are the problems currently being looked into, for which the opinion of other very senior-experienced-top level (bureaucrat) were sought? The DS reports that their first concern was ways and means for improving the accountability and service standard. Accountability to whom? Perish the thought that the bureaucrats would even have nightmares about making themselves accountable to anyone but themselves. Would they ask anyone but themselves about the standard of the service they are providing? The second concern was the system of receipt of letters in the Secretariat and their acknowledgment. Wow! What a major problem!! How do you receive a letter and acknowledge that you have actually received it? Surely, such a problem calls for a major consultation meeting of numerous very senior-experienced-top level-civil bureaucrats. Aren't we impressed? I am sure after due and deep consideration, may be with the help of another high level committee, the bureaucrats would find a way to receive and acknowledge letters. That would be the day! The third and another major concern was the simplification of payment of travel tax. Dear reader, please ponder over the enormity of the problem. How do you actually pay travel tax at the airport? I am sure we are all at our wits end. How do you figure out a solution? Obviously, you call a meeting of numerous very senior-experienced-top level-bureaucrats, 'right'? The next problem was \"early retirement with incentive\". Now, how many of you, dear readers, know of government officials, particularly those involved in governmental transactions, who wouldn't actually pay incentives to the government not to retire them? The next problem that the numerous very senior-experienced-top level-bureaucrats pondered over was how to simplify procedures of pension. Not your pension. Their pension, after they have actually retired. After having so diligently and very honestly served the government for, say, a quarter of century, it they themselves can't get their pensions paid to them, have they pondered about the situation of those who are owed money by the government? Those who only have occasional dealings with the government and none of the powers of the bureaucrats. Perish the thought that they would be concerned about you and me, about our payments. The list goes on. How do you pay all your bills easily (the so-called 'one stop bill payment system'). It makes you shudder. Doesn't it? Lets pray that this committee's solution will complicate the matters only up to a certain degree and they will leave it to the next committee to bring in yet more complications in your bill-paying endeavours. Actually I'll bet on that as I am sure their ability to harass the public, despite their best efforts, is limited by their inability which clearly outweighs their abilities. Then there is the \"magnetisation of the vehicle entitlement of the officers\". Not so long ago there were reports in the newspapers that each government vehicle costs the tax payers some thing like Taka 27,000 per month to operate. Will the monetisation be based in such a figure? You bet!! In this time of Eid festivities, will the readers join me in wishing the bureaucrats?

{"title": "Temples still under attack", "body": "Fanatics destroyed an idol of goddess Kali before setting a Hindu temple on fire at Hatibandha upazila of Lalmonirhat in the early hours yesterday. The 15-year-old Sree Sree Kali Mandir at Bejgram village, 2 kilometres off the Indian border, was burnt down when villagers were asleep, locals said. Hearing the crackling of flames around 4:30 am, villagers rushed to the temple and doused the fire after an hour-long effort, reports our Lalmonirhat correspondent. Incidents of vandalism and arson attacks on temples and houses of the Hindus have been rampant since February 28. On that day, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 awarded death penalty to Jamaat leader Delawar Hossain Sayedee for his crimes against humanity during the country's Liberation War. Since then, miscreants destroyed at least 22 temples, 122 houses and dozens of shops belonging to the Hindus across the country. They also physically assaulted men, women and children of the community and set their houses ablaze after looting.

{"title": "Shifting underpinnings of foreign relations", "body": "Foreign policy is one of the principal instruments adopted by a government to serve a sovereign state's national interests. It is a composite set of plan and strategy of a state in its interaction with other sovereign states and determines relationship of a given state with other states. Unlike policy formulations in other important areas of national life which puts domestic considerations into comparatively sharper focus, the development of foreign policy -- apart from taking into calculation vital domestic considerations -- is influenced by a host of external factors like global geo-political realities and strategic considerations, plans of other powers to advance their specific geopolitical designs, and the policies and behavioural of other states in the neighborhood and beyond. The world today is increasingly getting more and more interdependent and interconnected -- development of one state increasingly influencing and being influenced by that of others. As a result in the pursuit of national interest foreign relations of a state play a progressively greater impact. Foreign policy of a state thus has to be designed and crafted carefully and with dexterity to preserve, protect and promote national interests. In the past many states -- big or small -- followed a policy of isolationism with varying degrees of success. For example the United States of America, at one time, sought complete withdrawal from international affairs, and followed a policy of disengagement and non-entanglement in order to isolate itself from \"the perils of international dependence and foreign wars\". In the past China also tried to isolate itself from engagement with the world beyond its borders. In sharp contrast to that policy of isolation the present foreign policy of USA is marked by an intense role in global power dynamics covering the entire gamut of international relations. China has also increasingly assumed a high profile role in global political and economic issues. The concept of isolationism or insulation is now totally passé. No state can now live in isolation. The phenomenal progress in technology, in this century and the last, has introduced a speed in physical communication that was hard to anticipate earlier. Electronic communication has become instantaneous. In the words of Walter Wriston, 'information technology has demolished time and distance'. An event anywhere in the world today reaches the farthest corner in the twinkling of an eye and causes consequences there. A state's policy and conduct impacts on others' as these have never done before as much its own policy and conduct is similarly affected by those of other states. This phenomenon is true for all states, regardless of geographical size, comparative military strength or economic power and regardless whether the states are situated near to or far from each other. There is a well known metaphor that states that 'a butterfly flapping wings in Brazil causes tornado in Texas'. This metaphor succinctly encapsulates current international realities. States in the world have now been thrown into an intricate web of interdependence that no state can escape from. Consequently the belief in isolationism has steadily and surely been replaced by the concept of internationalism and globalism. Clearly this concept has assumed an irreversible character as it defines & will continue to define the contours of the dynamics of inter-state relations in the future. What are national interests of a state and how does one define them? A close examination of history reveals that national interest of a state has been more a dynamic concept than a static one. National interest is also multi-faceted as the concept embraces a varied range of components. While some components of national interest remain constant the emphasis that a state attaches to many other components may & do shift and change over time. A crucially permanent element of national interest is the state's survival and security. With this concept the upholding a nation's sovereignty and protecting its territorial integrity is inextricably linked. There have been many variable components also. At times, containing the growth & spread of particular brands of political dispensation to protect and preserve its own preferred political system has been viewed by many states as of vital national interest. Many states have also seen the spread of the nation's culture as of great importance to the pursuit of national interest. There was a time when the whims of a king, or a dictator or a sovereign determined what a state's national interest was; not infrequently his interest was synonymous with national interest. All this have changed significantly. With the rising level of peoples' consciousness and as democratic values consolidate their sway economic development, amelioration of the economic condition, and achievement of economic prosperity of its people have emerged as a critically important component of a state's national interest. Most nations today define their national interest in economic terms, in terms of achieving economic prosperity for its people. This changed definitional emphasis of national interest has brought about a paradigm shift in the security perceptions of states all over the world. The traditional security concern of a state primarily related to the threats from an external source directed against the sovereignty of the state. Defending the state's geographical boundary, territorial integrity, political institutions and peoples' right to self-determination constituted the most core elements of its response to that threat. To these core elements of threat perception have now been added the concept of human security that encompasses elements that degrade the quality of life of the people like poverty, want, hunger, disease and malnutrition. In a broader context the concept also includes freedom from fear and safety from chronic threats such as repression as well as protection of human rights and protection from harmful disruption in the pattern of human life. Security concerns of a state have thus assumed a more comprehensive & all embracing character. As an important ramification of this emerging concept threat to security is being seen in a holistic & integrated context as common threat to states and not emanating from each other. The concept underscores that security of one state promotes security of the other and brings about a synthesis of security concerns among states. A security threat to one state accentuates insecurity of other states, the cumulative effect of which increases global insecurity. Consequently common security threats -- that includes poverty, want, hunger, disease and malnutrition straddling territorial boundaries -- promote convergence of national interest of states, as prosperity of one is seen as interwoven with the prosperity of the other. This, therefore, unites states rather than divides states. The shrinking of globe and the 'butter fly effect' imparts added stimulus to this process. Also this holistic perception of security provides incentives to nations to cooperate with one another to face the common threat rather than be antagonistic to one another. While this notion is true for relations among all states around the globe -- situated near or far its significance is more profoundly manifested among geographically contiguous countries. Among physically contiguous states it creates greater mutuality of interests. Therefore, physical contiguity between states now provides for natural friendship, amity and cooperation. Consequently some old beliefs governing relations between physically contiguous states have radically changed. In effect it has brought about a reversal of those postulates. The orthodox security considerations were predicated on a potential inter-state conflict primarily emanating between neighboring countries that essentially called for a military response aimed at protecting the borders. The shrinking of time and space has changed the traditional idea of neighborhood; as the world gets smaller the concept of 'neighborhood' expands to embrace in its ambit countries far & wide. The Chanakyan theory was considered an immutable precept that shaped the psyche of state leaders & policy makers in formulating foreign policy. The essence of that theory was 'Your neighbor is your natural enemy and the neighbor's neighbour is your friend'. That has lost much of its validity; the threat to territorial integrity of a state could arise -- if it so does -- from any country no matter where it is geographically located and from the view point of threat perception physical contiguity has become irrelevant. On the contrary, the converse postulate is more and more true now. The converging perception of national interests and security concerns has also brought primacy of economics to the fore-front of international relations. As economics triumphs over politics the emerging world order is characterised by lower levels of political discord and higher levels of economic understanding. This in its turn creates expanding scope for forging economic ties and strengthening cooperation among states. In an inter-connected world conflicting aspects of inter state relations are being replaced by new norms of interdependence, cooperation and common opportunities. Trade, investments and access to markets are issues are increasingly taking the centre stage of international relations. As creation of wealth, achieving economic prosperity & quest for a better life for the peoples emerge as shared global objectives the world creates new opportunities for growth and development. Economic competition is not seen as a threat but more as a healthy inducement learn from each others' experience and to co-operate and collaborate. The realisation that no nation can progress alone and no nation can achieve prosperity in isolation is generating innovative ideas for stronger foundation for advancing shared interests. The recognition that poverty anywhere threatens prosperity everywhere is engendering search for win-win solutions in preference of zero-sum games. In brief these are some of the dynamics that determine the changing contour of global foreign relations. In the light of these shifting underpinnings of foreign relations it may be pertinent to highlight, on a practical plane, a priority issue that undoubtedly is of enormous significance to advance the national interest of Bangladesh and protect its comprehensive security. A momentous change is taking place in the world economic regime. The rise of Asia to the world economic stage is going to define the coming era. In the eighteenth century Asia's share in economy was 50% of the global economic out put. For much of recorded history China was not only the largest economy, but until the end of the 15th century, it also had the highest income per capita and was the world's technological leader. As recently as 1820, China alone accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. Then Asia missed the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and stagnated while Europe and America gained economic power. Consequently Asia's share shrank to less than 20% of the global output and China's share fell to only 9%. The table is, however, turning again. China's is on the rise as its role in the global economy increases sharply. During the last quarter of a century Chinese economy has grown at an amazing rate of about 10% per year. In economic size China is the biggest economy in Asia and globally it is surpassed only by the USA. With China's foreign exchange reserves of over $1 trillion it enjoys the distinction of being the largest surplus country. China has grown to be the third largest trading nation of the world following the USA and Germany. China's outward Foreign Direct Investment is steadily on the increase. In the words of Professor Shambaugh, \"The tectonic plates that have characterized Asia for half a century are shifting, and China may be returning to its traditional role ...\" With China also on the rise is another country, India. World's 11th biggest economy India is the second fastest-growing major economy closely following China. Since its economic reforms in 1991 India's has experienced an impressive growth rate of more than 6%. The current growth rate is estimated to be around a spectacular 8.9%. It is expected to maintain this momentum and grow at the rate of 8 to 9% for the next quarter century. India's outward investment is progressively rising as it emerges as 21st largest outward investor in the world. India's global trade is expanding at a fast rate. With these impressive growth rates coupled with expanding global trading & economic relations these two countries are emerging as global economic powers dominating the world economic arena for the foreseeable future. The combined effect of their unprecedented economic growth will secure back for Asia its historical share in world economy. It is predicted by economists in economic power this century will belong to Asia. This offers Bangladesh an attractive window of opportunity - a window that presents vast prospects to Bangladesh to prosper together with these economic power houses. To do that Bangladesh will need to effectively marshal the full force of its foreign policy to build & strengthen cooperative economic linkages with these countries. It may be relevant to remind ourselves that crafting of a successful foreign policy calls for a profound foresight & vision to envisage the contours of future interactions among states in the light of an objective assessment of the current realities tampered by knowledge of history. While history is a gauge for foreign policy formulation it can not stagnate or languish in history. Nor can it afford to get stuck in a mind set fashioned by political theories propounded centuries back. A vibrant foreign policy will need to have the ability to promptly make necessary adjustments to appropriately respond to the shifting underpinnings of foreign relations. The formulation of such a dynamic foreign policy will call for talent & dexterity to continuously rethink & recalibrate actions & responses. For the economic prosperity of its people Bangladesh needs to seize the window of opportunity that has been offered. Bangladesh needs to harness its rich potential and derive its fullest benefit. Sooner Bangladesh does that the better & more effectively it will be able to advance its national interests and safeguard its security concerns.

The port city side stunned the visitors when new signing Choumrin Rakhain headed them ahead in the 27th minute. The lead lasted for almost 40 minutes before Mohammedan mounted a challenge and took the game away. The Black and Whites, switched to 4-4-2 formation from 4-2-3-1 formation, restored parity in the 66th minute, thanks to a powerful header from Guinean forward Ismael Bangoura. Defender Mintu Sheikh gave the visitors the lead from a free-kick on in the 79th minute before Towhidul Alam Sabuj wrapped up the victory two minutes into the stoppage time. The win took the Old Dhaka outfit to 23 points, just three behind league leaders Sheikh Jamal DC while Chittagong Abahani remained at 10th position with five points from 11 matches. “We were ahead of Chittagong Abahani both technically and tactically even though they adopted a negative approach of wasting time after taking the lead. However, we were always confident of making a comeback,” said Mohammedan coach Josimuddin Ahmed Joshi. Meanwhile, Muktijoddha Sangsad were held to a goalless draw by Feni Soccer Club at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka. Muktijoddha Sangsad had the opportunity to reduce the gap with the league leaders Sheikh Jamal to four points, but their forwards wasted numerous opportunities either side of the break. The All Reds had signed up Guinean Vasseba Toure in the mid-term transfer window to strengthen the midfield but the lanky midfielder hardly impressed in his maiden appearance. They also struggled in the absence of Maruf Ahmed, who was terminated by the club recently and eventually dropping two points against a side they beat 2-1 in the first leg. Muktijoddha's Senegalese striker Camara Sarba wasted the first opportunity as he failed to beat goalkeeper Golam Mustafa in a one-on-one situation in the 12th minute while Feni Soccer saw unmarked Iqbal Hossain spoil their lone opportunity with a weak header which hardly troubled Muktijoddha goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury. After resumption, Muktijoddha's Naimur Rahman Shahed was denied by the woodwork while substitute Rokonuzzaman Kanchan squandered two sitters from close-range in the dying moments. The stalemate took Muktijoddha to 20 points while Feni Soccer moved to eighth position with nine points from 11 matches. WALSON RESCUES BROTHERS In the second match of the day in Dhaka, Augustine Walson scored twice to salvage a point for Brothers Union against Team BJMC.

The survey covered 72 cities worldwide and measured occupancy costs as opposed to rents. Occupancy costs includes rents, property tax and maintenance costs. The poll findings noted that with the exception of Johannesburg, the other nine most competitive cities surveyed were all in the Asia-Pacific - Christchurch, Bangkok, Surabaya, Dalian, Kuala Lumpur, Wellington, Manila, Adelaide and Tianjin. \"While demand is returning, albeit cautiously in some cities, the general over-supply situation in the next few years will ensure that office occupancy costs remain competitive,\" according to the report's 2000 forecast for office occupancy in the Asia-Pacific region. It added that office users were becoming more cautious in managing occupancy costs and many were no longer confining themselves to the central business districts. \"With lower costs, major office users are taking a medium to long-term view of their accommodation requirements to consolidate their operations in one location and relocate into better quality space,\" it said. The survey showed that only three Asian office districts - Tokyo's Central 5 Wards and Outer Wards, and Hong Kong - were in the list of top 10 districts worldwide with the highest occupancy costs. Before the regional crisis, seven Asian districts were on the list. Tokyo Central 5 Wards was ranked by the global survey as the most expensive in terms of office occupancy costs while the Japanese capital's Outer Wards took fourth spot. Hong Kong which topped the list prior to the crisis has dropped to the fifth position. The survey also showed that Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore had the highest occupancy costs in the region. Looking ahead, office occupancy costs are expected to ease moderately or stabilise in almost all the cities\", the survey report said. \"Recovery in the economies will continue to firm occupancy costs and underpin the office markets,\" it said. On a regional basis, the Asia-Pacific emerged from the poll as the most competitive in terms of office occupancy costs, beating Western Europe, North America and Eastern and Central Europe.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/asian-office-occupancy-costs-more-competitive-now-survey", "date": "2000-01-03T00:00:20+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 429},

{"title": "Renewed religious clashes in Indonesia", "body": "JAKARTA, Jan 4: Clashes between Muslims and Christians in eastern Indonesia's Maluku islands raged on Tuesday, the military said, sending the death toll from two weeks of violence soaring to more than 600. Muslims and Christians battled for the third straight day in Masohi, the main town on Seram island, leaving dozens dead, First Sergeant Lanursani of the local military office told AFP. \"I can hear sounds of gunfire and bomb explosions here and there,\" Lanursani said. \"I can say that dozens of people have died although I don't know the precise number,\" he added. He said the violence had continued unabated despite the deployment of hundreds of security personnel, including reinforcements from Java island. \"Soldiers have been forced to shoot at the warring mobs,\" the officer said. Sectarian clashes on the northern Maluku island of Halmahera have killed at least 400 people since December 27, the official Antara news agency said, quoting the North Maluku police chief Lieutenant Colonel Didik Prijantono. The figure includes more than 250 killed during three days of violence in the island's Tobelo sub-district starting on December 27 when Christians angered by the burning of a church on Ambon island the previous day went on a rampage and attacked Muslim residents. At least 63 more people died last week in similar clashes in Ambon, the main city of Maluku. Another outbreak of sectarian violence killed 165 on neighbouring Buru island. Thousands of people from Halmahera, mostly Muslims, have sought refuge in neigbouring Ternate island, the agency said. Some 1,500 troop reinforcements from East Java province and 15 doctors from Jakarta arrived on Monday in Ternate, the main city of the newly-formed province of North Maluku which also covers Halmahera. The military headquarters in Jakarta said a total of 8,000 additional army troops have been deployed in North Maluku to support some 1,000 police and soldiers there. The military on December 29 assumed responsibility for security in Maluku, known as the Spice Islands during colonial times, allowing security forces to search houses, conduct checks, and arrest suspects. A year of conflict between Muslims and Christians in Maluku has left 1,134 dead, over 2,300 injured and more than 8,500 buildings, including more than 122 places of worship, either damaged or burned. Many of those killed and wounded have been shot by security forces caught in the middle of warring mobs. The clashes first erupted on January 19, 1999 on the island of Ambon following a dispute between a public transport driver and a migrant. The violence has since spread to at least five other islands in the Malukus, once noted for its religious harmony. The violence forced tens of thousands to flee their homes and seek refuge in local military installations or elsewhere in Indonesia.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/renewed-religious-clashes-in-indonesia", "date": "2000-01-05T00:00:58+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 458},

A tropical country completely unused to fire-place or heater-blower culture has suddenly had near-western world inclemency with eye-level dense fog and overcast sky that would not allow sunlight to penetrate for normal warmth into the habitat. Barring a few days' interval, from perhaps tomorrow, the Met Office says, the cold wave is likely to re-visit us in a worse form around the second week of January. So, this is still a sordidly developing situation which we must approach and rise up to with the benefit of lessons learnt from the hopefully receding first phase of the cold wave. The distribution of clothes and banquets was Dhaka-centred and ill-organised as this was, a greater number went away empty-handed cursing the government more than their own lot. Apparently, there was more of tokenism and display under the TV camera rather than a noticeably caring and effectual governmental activism. But have we not been rudely shaken into realising that a cold wave can bring forth as much of a national exigency as a cyclone or flood does? There is, therefore, no way we can trivialise the arrangements needed for reaching adequate relief to the cold-stricken people.

The survey on \"Drug Trafficking and Child Abuse\" showed that as many as 200 children are carrying and selling drugs in about 30 points of the city on behalf of their unidentified \"bosses\". It said 20 per cent of the children, mostly from poverty-stricken families, are below 10 years of age and 65 per cent are between 12 and 14 while 15 per cent are above 14. They are used mainly for safe trafficking. The survey, conducted by Unnayan Shahojogy Team (UST), said the children are working for their bosses taking high risk. Seventy-four per cent of the children attributed their involvement in the illegal profession to the financial hardship of their families while 12 per cent said at the primary stage they carried out the orders of their bosses and gradually got involved in the job for lust of money. The report said 70 per cent children have taken up this job with the help of their known persons while seven per cent with their parent's cooperation and six per cent by relatives and five per cent aided by their friends. Ninety per cent children sell Phensidyl along with other drugs, but 60 per cent sell only Phensidyl. Three per cent occasionally sell heroin and five per cent Pathidrine alongwith Phensidyl. Other items, the children carry, are ganja, cigarettes and various types of wine. All of the children, identified in the survey, have the experience of physical and psychological torture by their bosses, police, musclemen. Sometimes they fall victim to the wrath of misidentified customers. Sixty per cent of them use nick names and hide their addresses for security reasons.

Ten per cent of them said they understand that they are doing wrong and they want to give it up if they find better job while 85 per cent think \"it's not a bad job\".

{"title": "A Cry for a Durable Peace", "body": "Making peace in the insurgency-affected Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh is just like chasing a chameleon in the deep forest. As the government-opposition standoff continues on a secretly negotiated and recently signed government-rebel pact, layer after layer of smokescreens of uncertainty darken the prospect of the long-awaited peace transforming it fast into something very difficult, illusive and unattainable. Day in and day out since the signing of the highly disputed pact on December 2, peace lost its ground little by little to a new wave of unrest across the area. If the current situation goes on unchecked, the picturesque region of south-eastern Bangladesh that still bears the marks of bruises for a prolonged animosity may come under a renewed and intensified trouble - both from inside and across the border. High hopes for peace and tranquility in an area of about 5,000 square miles have now been replaced by a growing fear of violence in the entire region - and beyond in other parts of Bangladesh. BNP, the major opposition political party of the country which outright rejected the peace pact dubbing it as a \"black deed with seeds for future separatism\" has reconfirmed its stance to continue movement through the holy month of Ramadan demanding its cancellation. As of now the so-called peace is at a very critical phase and so is the government. Ironically, the problem facing the government today was created by itself. The government couldn't take into confidence the opposition parties, the public and the press until the treaty was signed. Although the pact was immediately hailed by the heads of several foreign missions in Dhaka, such an accord would probably have never crossed even the corridors of their countries' legislative assemblies without a bipartisan support or national consensus, not to speak of its reaching the signing table. Peace-making between two parties is always a difficult task and it is more so when one or the other party is fighting for a political cause. This is precisely the reason why peace hasn't yet been established in many parts of the world including Northern Ireland. However, this doesn't mean that there cannot be peace between the Bangladesh government and the Shanti Bahini. Of course, it can and should be. But the process of peace-making that was followed by the Awami League government was grossly flawed. In a democracy, the government must take people into confidence in all important matters. This is, in fact, the most important precondition for this system. The merit of this is that the government's responsibilities for all major decisions on matters of national importance are shared by the people. Democracy never allows the government to take major decisions unilaterally on national issues keeping the public in the dark. So, by striking a deal alone and secretly with the rebels who fought a prolonged guerrilla war in Bangladesh which is a serious national issue, the Awami League government seems to have ignored the basic rules of democracy. One cannot but be convinced after taking a closer look at the peace pact that on implementation of the accord the entire Chittagong Hill Tracts will be governed in one fashion (through the high-powered Regional Council) while the rest of the country in another. This new administrative arrangement exclusively for the hilly region obviously goes against the spirit of the unitary character of the Republic of Bangladesh which has been clearly spelt out in the very first article under part one (The Republic) of the Constitution of the country. This is just one example of how the treaty came into conflict with the Constitution. Articles 28 (The state shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.) and 29 (There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in respect of employment or office in the service of the Republic. And no citizen shall, on grounds of only religion, race, caste, sex or place or birth, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of any employment or office in the service of the Republic.) also clash with the provisions of the peace pact. The power of the sovereign Parliament of Bangladesh has also been curtailed by allowing the Regional Council a final say on anything relating to Chittagong Hill Tracts. A close scrutiny of the peace pact suggests that a fair amount of autonomy has been granted to Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity cutting across the provisions of the country's Constitution. This truth cannot be denied by any argument and it must be told to the nation. However, instead of frankly admitting the fact to the people, the poorly advised government of Sheikh Hasina is unsuccessfully trying to suppress it through misleading statements. By doing so, Sheikh Hasina is offering the opposition parties - particularly her archrival BNP - an opportunity to make up exaggerated and colourful stories on Chittagong Hill Tracts which are further misleading the people. What is the ultimate goal of a peace pact? To achieve a durable peace. And a durable peace is that what is endorsed by all parties. The Awami League government should have made exactly that peace with the Shanti Bahini which would be ever-lasting outliving not only its tenure but those of all other subsequent governments. But regrettably the prospect of recently made peace looks dim with all major opposition parties - not just the BNP - registering their protests against it. Even Jatiya Party headed by General Ershad - which is a partner of Sheikh Hasina's government - is also convinced that the peace pact was signed violating the provisions of the Constitution. The opposition BNP with its seven other allies, Jamaat-e-Islami and Ershad's Jatiya Party publicly oppose the peace treaty. This means that the majority of the people of the country are against it. Then where this peace treaty is going to go from here? Can it be imposed on the nation even without the consent of the majority to it? Well, not under a democratic system. If the rules of democracy are not abided by for a desperate attempt to push the peace pact forward anyway, would that be an intelligent move? The answer is 'no.' Because none other than Sheikh Hasina herself probably knows it better that things change quite easily in Bangladesh with the change of governments. If such a change takes place in case of the current peace treaty too when Awami League government will not be in power, that will be a serious embarrassment not only for this party but also its partners for peace. That kind of situation will be very unfortunate not only for Chittagong Hill Tracts but for the entire nation. So, only a durable peace broadly supported by all parties can be a permanent solution to the long-standing problem, not the fragile one pursued by the Awami League government alone. The government should candidly admit to the nation that certain provisions of the Constitution might have come in conflict with the peace treaty and sit with the leaders of all political parties and professionals including lawyers and journalists for solving the problem collectively. If peace in a given part of the country badly bruised by a prolonged guerrilla warfare is worth certain amendments to the Constitution, so be it. Why not? Constitutional amendment is a commonplace. It can occur anytime in the greater interest of the nation. The prime purpose of the Constitution is to serve the people on the basis of equality, fairness and justice and guide the nation live a happy, prosperous an peaceful life. Breaking with its past tradition, BNP should come forward to help the government correct its mistake, if it thinks there has been any. Bringing thousands of Bangladeshis back home from a foreign land after a prolonged stay there, helping them rehabilitate and restart their lives anew in their own country, and also supporting a government move to establish a lasting peace in Chittagong Hill Tracts are equally the solemn responsibilities of all opposition parties including the BNP. For a lasting peace in Chittagong Hill Tracts, serious and heart-to-heart government-opposition discussions should be held both in and outside the Parliament. The government may consider putting the peace pact in abeyance to facilitate a full-house constructive and lively discussion on it leading to its ratification.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/a-cry-for-a-durable-peace", "date": "1998-01-13T00:00:42+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1381},

Officials at the EC Secretariat in the capital were busy receiving the lists of candidates from across the country till late last night. Meanwhile, the tussle between the government and the EC over deployment of troops during the polls is still to be over with both sides showing no signs budging from the respective positions. The dispute followed an EC decision to deploy troops to maintain law and order during the election. The government questioned the EC's jurisdiction as far as the deployment of army is concerned. Some 25 non-government organisations sought accreditation from the EC to monitor the polls, according to the EC sources. This time the number of election observers is likely to soar to 100,000 from 30,000 in the 1997 election. Meantime, the commission has started exchanging views with the NGOs. Apart from other preparations, the commission is busy preparing the \"observers' accreditation\" cards. The observers are to follow the code of conduct the EC promulgated during the eighth parliamentary election in October 2001. Also, the election observers will be under legal cover like in the general election.

{"title": "48 B'deshi firms gets aproval by meeting health crireria", "body": "Forty-eight of an initial total of 58 processing plants have received provisional approval to export frozen foods to European Union member countries. EU Ambassador to Bangladesh, Michael Drury, told The Daily Star yesterday that the EU might give Bangladesh technical assistance to train people in the frozen food industry to upgrade their skills and maintain proper EU quality. \"Since it's provisional, Bangladesh can raise the number of eligible exporters if they can satisfy EU's health criteria,\" Drury said. He said EU does not issue permanent certificate to any exporter. The Department of Fisheries, after inspecting the country's 122 plants found 58 eligible to comply with EU health regulations. After checking documents, a recent EU team approved 48 plants which can export to the EU countries. The team gave the other ten plants six months time to improve their quality. Drury said Bangladesh officials were well aware of the EU's quality criteria and were receptive to suggestions made by the EU officials. Drury said the country's testing laboratories need good equipment to maintain quality of the foods. He said food processors and exporters need constant efforts and vigilance to maintain conformity with EU rules, known as Hazards Analysis of Critical Control Point (HACCP). Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association Secretary General Dr Aftabuzzaman also agreed that the number of testing laboratories was insufficient and not well equipped. A senior official of the fisheries' department told The Daily Star that Bangladesh could hardly maintain the quality of its frozen foods' with only three testing laboratories. He said the EU required 300 samples each day while these laboratories could analyse only 30 samples. He said the processing units must use drinking water to produce ice and wash exportable sea foods to abide by the EU directives. He also said the HACCP aims to prevent foods from toxics, anti-biotics, hystamins, and bacteria responsible for food poisoning. Frozen foods stand third in the country's export list in terms of foreign exchange earning. Bangladesh fetched 290 million US dollars during July-May period of the fiscal 1996-97. Meanwhile, the government is planning to implement a project namely \"Strengthening of Fish Inspection and Quality Control Service in Bangladesh\" from next month. The project may cost Tk 70 crore, the fisheries official said. The project will be immediately taken to upgrade quality of the ten plants and address the minor problems of the approved 48 plants. The official said the project would help three laboratories raise their sample items up to 200 a day. The government will finance the project which may begin its implementation within one month.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/48-bdeshi-firms-gets-aproval-by-meeting-health-crireria", "date": "1997-07-17T00:00:08+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 428},
{"title": "Jamaat supporters'new propaganda", "body": "Jamaat-Shibir supporters have been continuing their propaganda through social media, now claiming the arms and ammunition recently seized by Indian police were actually being smuggled by the Bangladesh government to wipe out Chhatra Shibir. A photo titled \"Conspiracy of Awami League Unveiled\" posted by one \"18-party alliance\" shows a huge number of AK-47 rifles. The post also gives a long narrative of how the government trained members of Chhatra League, the pro-Awami League student body, to use these arms against Jamaat-Shibir men. Posted at 5:30pm yesterday on a page named Basherkella Chittagong, the narrative adds the arms and ammunition were coming from Myanmar but the Indian authorities, unhappy with the \"commission\" offered, seized those. It may be mentioned the Indian police on Friday said they seized 31 assault rifles, an automatic rifle, a light machine gun and some ammunition in Mizoram as those were being smuggled into Bangladesh from Myanmar via India. After the main Basher Kella page was blocked by the authorities on Wednesday, the Jamaat-Shibir activists opened many pages like Basherkella Chittagong, Basherkella Feni, Basherkella Dubai and Basherkella Jeddah. One post on Basherkella Dubai claims committees have been formed in every neighbourhood to wipe out Jamaat-Shibir. The government has supplied Ak-47 rifles with licence to different top-level members of Awami League wings like Jubo League and Chhatra League. \"So now it's time to be ready for an inevitable war. We are going to win this battle, Inshallah,\" the post said yesterday evening. Their pages are also flooded with posts against the March 13 Chittagong rally called by Imran H Sarker, spokesperson of the Shahbagh movement. \"Let's resist the atheist bloggers on March 13. We would not let them enter Chittagong,” says one post on Media Watch Bangladesh, another Facebook page allegedly run by Jamaat-Shibir activists. Jamaat-Shibir supporters are also sharing a collage photo showing several people pointing a gun at Imran, also the convener of Blogger and Online Activist Network. The photo caption says: Everybody wants to kill Imran. Also yesterday, they uploaded a photo whose caption says the Hindu community in Nilphamari brought out a procession demanding the release of Jamaat leader Sayedee, who was given death sentence for 1971 war crimes. They are also spreading an English documentary through their pages showing Sayedee was convicted for war crimes committed by another Razakar named Delowar Shikder in Pirojpur. \"Bangladesh, where society is suffering from so many social diseases -- corruption, crimes and many other social problems. Within those problems one pioneer came forward with light in the way of peace and tranquillity. Accepting his light, many people gave up stealing…,” opens the documentary titled \"Sayeedi on War Crime Tribunal.\" As seen in the credit line, one Independent News Network of Bangladesh made the documentary, which claims Sayedee to be \"an innocent, pious person\".", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/jamaat-supportersnew-propaganda", "date": "2013-03-11T02:35:32+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 466},
{"title": "IOC expels six members", "body": "LAUSANNE, Jan 25: Acting swiftly and forcefully to clean house, the International Olympic Committee has ousted six of its members in a bid to save its credibility following the biggest corruption scandal in Olympic history, reports AP. With the future of the organisation, its president and the games themselves under threat, the IOC said Sunday that it was determined to bring to an end \"the ugliest chapter\" in its 105-year history. Embattled IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch apologised to the world for the scandals but vowed to stay in office and restore the prestige of the Olympics. \"This is the beginning, not the end of our work,\" he said. \"I am certain that the Olympic movement will emerge from the crisis stronger than ever.\" As a third member resigned in the Salt Lake City scandal, Samaranch said three other members remained under investigation, while a fourth was warned about his actions by the ruling executive board. \"The members violated their Olympic oath and betrayed the confidence put in them by the Olympic family,\" Samaranch said. \"These actions were inappropriate and against the policy of our organisation.\" A special inquiry found eight IOC members had pocketed more than 440,000 dollars in cash and excessive gifts and services. One, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, received more than 216,000 dollars, the report said. Samaranch said he had \"temporarily excluded\" the six members, with a final vote due in March. The head of the investigation, IOC vice president Dick Pound, said the six were essentially expelled and could only ask to be reinstated by the remaining 106 IOC members. The action came at the end of a two-day emergency meeting to deal with a spiraling crisis that started with allegations of vote-buying in Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. While the scandal broke a little over a month ago, the IOC acted quickly, in part to placate international corporations that pay millions of dollars in Olympic sponsorships. In Salt Lake, Olympic organisers said they were pleased by the \"speed and efficiency\" of the IOC's investigation but also conceded they made some mistakes. \"We are deeply saddened. Some of these actions should not have taken place,\" Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake Organising Committee, said. \"Some of those actions were below the standards expected by this community.\" In Sydney, where the 2000 Games will be staged, organising committee chief Sandy Hollway said the IOC took the right actions. \"As regards to Sydney, we are very relaxed,\" he said. Hollway said the IOC appeared to be \"very confident\" of Sydney and had not launched an investigation except as part of a broader look at bidding cities. Samaranch said that the 2000 Summer Games would remain in Sydney and the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake, despite the scandal that has now encompassed both cities. Samaranch said the IOC would form an ethics commission and continue the corruption investigation in other cities, going back to the bids for the 1996 Games won by Atlanta. While Samaranch said he had no plans to resign, he said he would ask for a vote of confidence on his leadership at a special IOC assembly March 17-18, called to consider the executive board recommendations. IOC director general Francois Carrard said those members recommended for expulsion were Ganga, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander of Chile. Several said they would not resign and would fight the expulsion recommendations. \"I don't feel that I have been expelled, since it is the assembly that expels members,\" Arroyo said Sunday. \"My conscience is at peace.\" Still under investigation were Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast, Kim Un-yong of South Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, Carrard said. In addition, he said, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands had been issued a warning. Rene Essomba, an IOC member from Cameroon who died last year, also was mentioned in the investigation's findings. Reports that his daughter had received a scholarship from Salt Lake bidders touched off the scandal. The IOC board also recommended a radical change in the selection process for the 2006 Winter Games. Under the proposal, visits to bid cities by IOC members will be banned and the host will be selected by a 15-person body rather than the full assembly. The procedure for future Olympic selections will be decided after the 2006 vote. The IOC said six members appeared before the inquiry commission Saturday to defend themselves. They were not identified. The IOC is one of five bodies investigating the Salt Lake scandals. Other inquiries are being carried out by the Salt Lake ethics committee, the Justice Department and FBI, the US Olympic Committee and the Utah attorney general.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/ioc-expels-six-members", "date": "1999-01-26T00:00:40+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 797},

{"title": "No love lost between ACB, PCB", "body": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, Jan 10 (AP/AFP): Top cricket officials from Australia and Pakistan buried the hatchet over bribery allegations in public Sunday while private meetings shaped a united stand on the vexed issue. Australian Cricket Board Chairman Denis Rogers and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Khalid Mahmood held a joint news conference during a break in the International Cricket Council meeting. On Friday, Australian stars Mark Waugh and Shane Warne repeated allegations that former Pakistan captain Salim Malik offered them bribes to play badly in matches on Australia's 1994 tour. Malik has denied the allegations. The ICC's top priority Sunday and Monday was getting a united approach from member countries on the match-fixing and bribery issue. Spokeswoman Michelle Lewis said \"positive and significant progress\" was being made Sunday and the ICC was expected to have new rules ready to implement after Monday's session. Neither Rogers or Mahmood would comment on the substance of the ICC's closed door meeting Sunday, but wanted to make it clear that the two countries were not at war over the bribery issue. The two men \"are not bitter enemies,\" Rogers told reporters, but had cleared the air over \"misunderstandings and misinformation\" and \"established a close friendship.\" Because of that friendship, \"neither had to apologise to each other.\" Rogers said despite speculation about a deteriorating relationship between Pakistan and Australia, \"it's not happening.\" Mahmood endorsed the comments, adding there had been some \"lack of communication over the regulation of Australian players,\" but this had been cleared up. \"I hope in the future there will be no misunderstandings and miscommunications.\" He said the allegations of match-fixing against Pakistani players had caused substantial and extensive damage to both the players and the game. A Pakistan government inquiry, which had hearings in Melbourne Friday and Saturday, is crucial for the sport, he said. \"The extent of the damage, might I say, has been unlimited to some extent and therefore we are very keen that this inquiry is brought to its logical conclusion and if any player is found guilty action is taken against him - otherwise we like to get on with the game,\" Mahmood said. Mahmood hinted match-fixing may not be confined to his own country. \"Match-fixing, betting is an issue we are currently investigating and this can be more widespread than perceived to be,\" he said. ICC chairman Sir Clyde Walcott said draft proposal on match-fixing was being prepared. \"Then we'll take some decision,\" added Walcott, standing in for India's Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was unable to attend because his mother had died. Rogers said the rows had not been helpful \"but on balance it's good that it's out and we're dealing with it.\" Mahmood again denied a report he had called for life bans on Warne and Waugh. \"I did not call for a life ban on any Australian player,\" Mahmood said. \"In fact, I was shocked to see this interview of mine appearing in the press. I did not speak to anybody who claimed to be a writer or correspondent and therefore the question of calling for a ban did not arise. That was a fabrication.\" The ICC canceled a news conference on the match-fixing issue for Sunday evening. Lewis said officials would spend the evening and Monday morning further discussing the issue and would consult with Dalmiya before making any public comment. He has already warned the ICC should come down hard on anyone proven to be involved in match-fixing. Australian and New Zealand cricket chiefs have proposed the ICC takes control over the issues. Australian Cricket Board Chief executive Malcolm Speed said a mechanism was needed to empower the ICC to deal with the problems. \"We hope there is some direction from the ICC,\" he said last week. The ICC's biggest problem in attempting to root out corruption is that it possesses little genuine power - its constitution only allows recommendations not substantial action. \"That's an issue we have to address,\" ICC chief executive David Richards said Saturday. Richards said the international body must be empowered to make tough decisions, but it raised queries about the jurisdiction of the ICC to act in other countries. \"We have a vital role to play in these bribery issues, but what's up for debate is if the ICC has jurisdiction in sovereign countries if there is criminality involved,\" Richards said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/no-love-lost-between-acb-pcb", "date": "1999-01-11T00:00:42+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 722},

{"title": "Global internet slows after 'biggest attack in history'", "body": "The internet around the world has been slowed down in what security experts are describing as the biggest cyber-attack of its kind in history. A row between a spam-fighting group and hosting firm has sparked retaliation attacks affecting the wider internet. It is having an impact on popular services like Netflix - and experts worry it could escalate to affect banking and email systems. Five national cyber-police-forces are investigating the attacks. Spamhaus, a group based in both London and Geneva, is a non-profit organisation that aims to help email providers filter out spam and other unwanted content. To do this, the group maintains a number of blocklists - a database of servers known to be being used for malicious purposes. Recently, Spamhaus blocked servers maintained by Cyberbunker, a Dutch web host that states it will host anything with the exception of child pornography or terrorism-related material. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, who claims to be a spokesman for Cyberbunker, said, in a message, that Spamhaus was abusing its position, and should not be allowed to decide \"what goes and does not go on the internet\". Spamhaus has alleged that Cyberbunker, in cooperation with \"criminal gangs\" from Eastern Europe and Russia, is behind the attack. Cyberbunker has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, told the BBC the scale of the attack was unprecedented. \"We've been under this cyber-attack for well over a week. \"But we're up - they haven't been able to knock us down. Our engineers are doing an immense job in keeping it up - this sort of attack would take down pretty much anything else.\" Mr Linford told the BBC that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world. He claimed he was unable to disclose more details because the forces were concerned that they too may suffer attacks on their own infrastructure. The attackers have used a tactic known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which floods the intended target with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to render it unreachable. In this case, Spamhaus's Domain Name System (DNS) servers were targeted - the infrastructure that joins domain names, such as bbc.co.uk, the website's numerical internet protocol address. Mr Linford said the attack's power would be strong enough to take down government internet infrastructure. \"If you aimed this at Downing Street they would be down instantly,\" he said. \"They would be completely off the internet.\" He added: \"These attacks are peaking at 300 Gbps (gigabits per second). \"Normally when there are attacks against major banks, we're talking about 50 Gbps\" Clogged-up motorway The knock-on effect is hurting internet services globally, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. \"If you imagine it as a motorway, attacks try and put enough traffic on there to clog up the on and off ramps,\" he told the BBC. \"With this attack, there's so much traffic it's clogging up the motorway itself.\" Arbor Networks, a firm which specialises in protecting against DDoS attacks, also said it was the biggest such attack they had seen. \"The largest DDoS attack that we have witnessed prior to this was in 2010, which was 100 Gbps. Obviously the jump from 100 to 300 is pretty massive,\" said Dan Holden, the company's director of security research. \"There's certainly possibility for some collateral damage to other services along the way, depending on what that infrastructure looks like.\" Spamhaus said it was able to cope as it has highly distributed infrastructure in a number of countries. The group is supported by many of the world's largest internet companies who rely on it to filter unwanted material. Mr Linford told the BBC that several companies, such as Google, had made their resources available to help \"absorb all of this traffic\". The attacks typically happened in intermittent bursts of high activity. \"They are targeting every part of the internet infrastructure that they feel can be brought down,\" Mr Linford said. \"Spamhaus has more than 80 servers around the world. We've built the biggest DNS server around.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/global-internet-slows-after-biggest-attack-in-history-2", "date": "2013-03-29T00:30:52+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 682},

{"title": "Political strife, Eurozone crisis threaten economy: IMF", "body": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday advised the government to build up sufficient foreign exchange reserves to deal with political uncertainty and the Eurozone slowdown. The global economic slowdown coupled with election-year uncertainty in Bangladesh poses the most immediate challenge to policymakers, the IMF said in its country report yesterday. Although the spillovers from the Eurozone crisis appear manageable so far, the government should still take pre-emptive measures to build external and fiscal buffers, the IMF said. “These same buffers could also mitigate the effects of domestic strife ahead of upcoming elections.” The IMF identified escalating violence and lack of fiscal restraint ahead of the national elections as one of the vulnerabilities for the economy. Given the country's export dependence on Eurozone, where about half of the exports go, intensification of the crisis in the region might derail the economy, the IMF said. The garment sector -- which accounts for 80 percent of the country's exports and employs about four million workers, mainly women -- would particularly be affected, it said. The sector's exports, however, could also be affected by “a backlash” from the Tazreen fire tragedy in November 2012, further said IMF's risk assessment. “Balance of payments (BOP) pressures could intensify on a deeper export slump, destabilising the exchange rate and pressurising reserves.” If the risks do materialise, greater exchange rate flexibility would need to be coupled with moderate fiscal easing keeping the inflation and reserves in mind, the IMF said. Although IMF expects election-related costs to be contained within the bounds of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) programme, the possibility of fiscal slippages looms large. Fiscal slippages would lead to higher bank borrowings, increasing the development burden on the banking sector and government's reliance on Bangladesh Bank (BB) financing, with spillovers to monetary policy. In such a situation, the IMF called for fiscal tightening, readjustment of monetary targets and greater interest rate flexibility. Further deterioration of state banks' finances poses another major risk to the economy, according to IMF's risk assessment. “The financial performance of the SOCBs, even before factoring in recent frauds, points to the need to minimise systematic and fiscal risks.” To safeguard the banking system, strict enforcement of BB's memoranda of understanding with the state banks, aggressive pursuit of loan recoveries and a broader strategy to reinvigorate the state banks' operations are needed. World oil price shock fronts another risk to the economy, but not to the extent as the other three, the country report said. “The BOP would come under renewed pressure, while fuel-related subsidies could destabilise the fiscal stance.” The IMF recommends an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism to contain subsidies, temper demand and protect reserves, “backstopped” by greater exchange rate flexibility. Meanwhile, IMF deemed the overall fiscal stance to be prudent, “but tax revenue misses, while modest, and still-elevated subsidy costs bear close watch”. On revenues, in the short run, more aggressive tax enforcement could buttress collections. Over the medium term, value-added tax implementation, coupled with income tax reforms, could form the base for a modern tax regime, with technical, financial, and strategic support essential for success, it said. On expenditures, the IMF said following a series of price adjustments over the past 18 months, containment of electricity and fuel subsidies “now pivots to better cost controls”. For fertiliser, both cost management and price adjustments remain necessary, while better targeting of all subsidies is also essential to avoid crowding out other spending. The country's array of safety nets needs further refinements to protect the most vulnerable, added the IMF. “Debt management should focus on utilising concessional financing, complemented with selective nonconcessional borrowing to keep total debt levels manageable.” “The nonobservance of the continuous program ceiling on nonconcessional external debt underscores the need to strengthen debt management practices, with the authorities' commitment welcomed in this regard.” For all projects and activities that utilise nonconcessional borrowing, the government should take clear steps to ensure full transparency and sound governance in the allocation and use of the resources, with regular monitoring and reporting. The progress on financial sector reforms must also be accelerated. “BB must fully embrace its role as chief banking regulator, backed by further reforms to its regulatory and supervisory tool kit. For BB, early enforcement of new loan classification and provisioning standards and greater oversight of the SOCBs will better ensure financial stability.”", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/political-strife-eurozone-crisis-threaten-economy-imf", "date": "2013-03-13T02:15:33+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 721},
{"title": "Leaders blast comments of Golam Azam", "body": "Leaders of different political parties and forums yesterday condemned the audacious comments of Jamaat-e-Islam chief Prof Golam Azam and demanded his trial in a special tribunal, reports BSS. They said there is no problem for trial of the war criminals of 1971 under the Constitution and the law of the land. Prof Azam has dared to utter such imperious comments to BBC on Thursday that he could escape the net for his misdeeds in 1971 due to soft stand of the previous governments, they observed. Giving reaction to BSS, Hasan Imam, Convenor of the Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Jatiya Samannaya Committee, demanded of the government to try Golam Azam and other war criminals in a special tribunal. He urged the government to file a case with the Hague-based International Court for trial of all other war criminals including the Pakistanis who unleashed atrocities on the freedom-loving people. Imam said in the absence of a special tribunal no individual lodged a case against Golam Azam to help him sneak out through the loopholes of the existing laws. The Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee in its mass trial in 1992 gave the verdict that the crimes of Golam Azam during the War of Liberation were punishable by death and asked the then government to execute the verdict, he said. Chairman of the Central Command Council of Muktijoddha Sangsad Principal Ahad Chowdhury said Golam Azam is showing this unusual courage as he did not face trial for his crimes in the previous regimes. He strongly demanded of the government to set up a special tribunal to try the war criminal and take initiative to get other war criminals tried in the International Court. Workers' Party General Secretary Rashed Khan Menon said the demand for trial of war criminals is not new and it is very much possible under the constitutional ambit and the existing laws. All parties except the Jamaat in the fifth parliament reached a unanimous consensus that the war criminals must stand trial, he said. \"I remember, the then Deputy Leader of the House Prof. B Chowdhury read out the text of the consensus in the House,\" Menon said. Golam Azam cannot deny that he helped, supported and inspired the Pakistani army for genocide in 1971, which is historically recognized, Menon said, adding that there is no scope to evade the charges. Deputy leader of the opposition in parliament Prof. B Chowdhury told BSS, \"Nobody should have any objection if the constitution and the law of the land are properly enforced to settle an issue.\" \"But these must not be used intentionally against a certain person,\" Prof Chowdhury added. In an interview with the BBC radio yesterday, Golam Azam questioned why he was not tried for the last 18 years. He told the interviewer that despite filing cases against him nobody could make him an accused during his stay in the country since 1978.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/leaders-blast-comments-of-golam-azam", "date": "2000-01-15T00:00:17+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 479},

{"title": "France confirms death of al-Qaeda chief", "body": "The death of a top al-Qaeda-linked warlord in combat with French-led troops represents a victory in the battle against jihadists who had a stranglehold on northern Mali. But it is far from the defining blow against a wily enemy that can go underground and regroup to renew itself. Even the fearsome Abou Zeid is replaceable. A top commander of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Abou Zeid had been in the crosshairs of the French military and their African partners since they moved in to Mali on January 11 to rout radicals seen as a threat to northwest Africa and to Europe. An announcement Saturday by the French president's office that Abou Zeid's death in late February has been \"definitively confirmed\" ends weeks of speculation about his fate. Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, an Algerian thought to be 47, was a pillar of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb's southern realm, responsible for the death of at least two European hostages and a leader of the extremist takeover of northern Mali, which followed a coup d'etat a year ago. He joined a succession of radical insurgency movements in Algeria starting in the early 1990s and became known for his brutality and involvement in high-profile hostage-taking. President Francois Hollande's office said the death of Abou Zeid \"marks an important step in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel,\" the borderlands where the Sahara meets the sub-Saharan jungle, encompassing several nations where radicals are on the rise. French officials have maintained for weeks that the Abou Zeid was \"probably\" dead but waited to conduct DNA tests to verify. But jihadists have shown again and again that they can overcome the death of individual warlords. Even French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said that eliminating leaders \"doesn't solve everything.\" \"It's the entire structure that has to be put down and not this or that leader,\" he said in an interview with Le Monde earlier this month. al-Qaeda rebounded after commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan were killed. Leaders of jihadist movements in Algeria that gave birth to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM, were killed and seamlessly replaced. The top AQIM leader in Mali, with the title Emir of the Grand Sahara, Nabil Makloufi, was quickly replaced after being killed last fall in a road accident, according to Matthieu Guidere, an expert on radical Islam who monitors AQIM and other jihadist movements. The new top emir, Yahya El-Hammam, could now step into Abou Zeid's warlord role, according to one scenario. Abou Zeid was killed in operations in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in Mali's far north, the French statement said. The area where mountains meet the desert was Abou Zeid's stronghold — and thought to be where he was keeping four French hostages captured two years ago at a uranium mine in Niger. Their fate is unclear. The French military says the French-led forces have killed hundreds of extremist fighters in the two-month campaign in Mali, and French officials say they have cornered the al-Qaeda-linked groups in a patch of northern mountains. However, even a clear military success by the French and their African partners in Mali would not guarantee that AQIM will die. While based in northern Algeria, it has proven extremely mobile, latching on to political instability in the region and arming itself with weapons from Libya. AQIM has seeded ties with other radical Islamic movements like the violent Boko Haram in Nigeria. Last week, AQIM put out a call to jihadists throughout northern Africa to join the fronts in Mali and Algeria — or to stay home, and wage a war of preaching in countries like Tunisia or Morocco to turn the tide against \"secularists,\" according to the SITE Intel Group which monitors jihadist statements. Interviews with a series of experts on AQIM and other jihadist groups all suggest that a military victory is not the definitive answer to snuffing out jihadist terror, which can change form, move on to new theaters of operation or reignite if the instability it breeds on is not eliminated, too. \"The problem doesn't go away by eliminating terrorists,\" Sajjan Gokel of the London-based Asia-Pacific Foundation said in a recent interview. \"For every terrorist captured or killed there are at least five other terrorists coming down the assembly line.\" One analyst suggested that Abou Zeid's death may lead to greater unity among the various al-Qaeda-linked factions. Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for Training and Analysis of Terrorism, describes AQIM's organization as a set of insulated cells under the larger al-Qaeda umbrella, which existed independently of each other. The region of Mali — known in the group's parlance as the \"emirate of the Sahara\" — was divided between units loyal to Abou Zeid and those loyal to his arch-rival Moktar Belmoktar, who led an attack on a gas plant in Algeria in January that left dozens of foreign hostages dead. Rouiller said El-Hammam will likely take over control of Abou Zeid's katibat, or brigade. He said it was Hammam who had acted as the go-between when Abou Zeid wanted to communicate with Belmoktar. \"Especially if Hammam takes over, there could be a chance for a better coordinated relationship with Moktar Belmoktar,\" said Rouiller. \"I would not be surprised if we see a more united Saharan emirate.\" Chad's government claimed that Belmoktar was also killed in fighting in northern Mali, but the claim has not been independently verified. Mystery surrounds the powerful and shadowy figure of Abou Zeid, even regarding his real name. Along with his nom de guerre, Abou Zeid had an alias, Mosab Abdelouadoud, and nicknames, the emir of Timbuktu, the fabled city that became his fief during the 10-month-long occupation of Mali, and the little emir, due to his diminutive size. But the Algerian press has raised questions about his legal identity — Abid Hamadou or Mohamed Ghedir. He was viewed as a disciplined radical with close ties to the overall AQIM boss, Abdelmalek Droukdel, who oversees operations from his post in northern Algeria. Abou Zeid fought with a succession of Islamist insurgency movements trying to topple the Algerian state since 1992. He reportedly joined the brutal, and now defunct, Armed Islamic Group that massacred whole villages in northern Algeria, then joined the Salafist Group for Call and Combat that morphed into al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in 2006 under Droukdel's rule. An Algerian court tried him in absentia in January 2012, convicting him of belonging to an international terrorist group and sentencing him to life in prison. Abou Zeid was believed to be the most brutal of the top jihadist leaders in Mali. He held a Frenchman who was executed in July 2010. He's also been linked to the execution of a British hostage in 2009. In the Sahara, Abou Zeid's reputation for brutality toward hostages outdid that of Belmoktar, who in general allowed the foreigners in his care to receive medicine when needed. Rouiller says that an analysis done by his center of proof-of-life videos released by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb suggests that Hammam and another jihadist commander, Targui, are just as brutal toward hostages as was Abou Zeid. \"Based upon the analysis of the video sequences, I don't think either Hammam or Targui are more humane — the line will not change.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/france-confirms-death-of-al-qaeda-chief", "date": "2013-03-24T10:40:49+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1212},

{"title": "Making a university world class", "body": "Teachers, through their teaching, can a change human life. Since higher education deals essentially with knowledge, the change is knowledge-focused. The expected change is qualitative, and for both individual and social betterment. Through such change, teachers make human beings more productive and useful for building a knowledge-based society. However, teachers' responsibility is not limited to skill development and knowledge creation. The major product of the university -- the graduates produced by teachers -- provide leadership in accelerating economic, social, cultural, political and moral development who behave as responsible citizens as well. This means that quality assurance of higher education is a function of, among other inputs, the appropriate roles of teachers. By implication, teachers need to be role models. A university stands out when it has a critical mass of high profile enlightened Professors. For this paper, a world-class university is an institution of higher learning, where teachers from many countries come to teach, researchers join to undertake research and students throng to learn. The institution imparts high quality education to produce well qualified highly-skilled graduates, and disseminates socially meaningful research outputs in the form of publications, and patent rights embedded in inventions. In addition, a good university is engaged in \"Public Service\", often called community service. Such a university carries many attributes. One is its institutionalized outstanding capacity of innovative teaching, research and public service. To attain such capacity, a university obviously needs to fulfill many conditions. Most important of them is to hire and retain reputable professors and researchers. It is very important because in the process of hiring and retaining high profile professors and researchers the university, of necessity, fulfills most of the other conditions that must be fulfilled to make a university world class. No university can claim to be a high imaged university if it does not have an adequate number of adequately qualified professors and researchers. Inversely, only those universities that carry high image can attract world renowned professors and brilliant students. It is to be noted that the conditions that make internationally recognised professors interested in joining and sticking to a particular university coincide with those that assure quality of education. In other words, if a university assigns higher priority to hire and retain reputable teachers and researchers it simultaneously tends to assure quality of education which in turn makes the university a world class one. Therefore it is argued that hiring and retaining well recognised professors and researchers in increasing number is a pre-requisite for a university -- (teaching and/ or research institution) to be well recognized. Even mere association of high profile scholars, (professors and/or researchers) say, Nobel Laureates, enhances the image of the concerned university. A team of reputable professors along with brilliant students plays important roles in getting the university accredited by globally respected accreditation agency. A non-accredited university is usually perceived to be a university that imparts low quality education. Accreditation is an effective step for quality assurance. It is obvious that without the help and cooperation of the senior professors and researchers, gaining accreditation is practically impossible. Therefore, it is a situation of \"no good teachers, no accreditation\". Professors with good track records normally make sure, before they accept an offer of a new position, that the environment -- academic and non-academic-- at the university that wants to hire them matches their perceived standing in the academic community. No professor of high standing would move to a new position at another university that does not have well defined institutional vision, mission and strategies reflected in all its programmes. Beside, the university must offer nationally and globally acceptable academic programs taught by reputable teachers. The teacher will also demand academic freedom to publish; s/he may want best management practices combined with faculty governance in place. A good teacher would like to ensure a balanced teaching load and research opportunities. Similarly, dedicated teachers do not like disproportionately large number of part time teachers. Teaching by more part timers lowers the quality of teaching and eventually image of the university. A private university should not use more than 25% of the total number of teachers as part timer. Reputable teachers demand infrastructural facilities and management support necessary for undertaking research readily available. They will demand class rooms equipped with computer terminals, research laboratories supported by computers and other necessary equipment and instruments. Besides, state of the art ICT-based on line digitised libraries will have to be provided for good teachers and students. A sizable number of talented students (potential research assistants) who can support the professors with research should be available. However, hiring and retaining reputable teachers is not enough to get the most from their association. The Vice Chancellor must install a mechanism of monitoring the accountability of the teachers. They must perform their duties and responsibilities as stated in the university Service Rules and in their individual appointment letters. An effective performance evaluation must be in place. In the absence of such monitoring, mere presence of \"good\" teachers will not produce the desired result. Moreover, professors with international reputation attract other good professors from foreign universities, and best students from foreign countries. This facilitates the process of internationalisation, a pre-requisite for global recognition of a university. The more internationalised a university is the higher is its reputation. When a university succeeds in attracting teachers of international reputation an increasing number of brilliant students from many countries compete to enroll at that university, which in turn makes the university an enterprise of exporting education. (It is assumed that foreign students pay tuition and other fees in foreign currency). This means that good teachers play special roles through spread effects in internationalizing and thereby making it a global university. However, it is to be noted that highly talented students attract high profile teachers. Similarly, well qualified reputable teachers attract talented students. It may be added here that if for some reason the bright students are taught by inadequately qualified teachers, the bright students in general lose their brightness due to the teachers' inability to teach properly; as a result their high standard tends to go down. This causes a social loss. This again shows the importance of good teachers. To be regionally or internationally recognised, a university must follow best management practices and good governance. Here \"best management practices\" is used in a special sense. It is a management system that includes faculty governance, and institutionalises at the university a sustainable quality assurance process. This calls for a decision-making process which is transparent, logical, rule-based and fair for all. All decisions are taken by the respective committees complying the rules and regulations stated in the Private university Act 2010 enacted by the National Parliament, the University Statutes, Service Rules and Finance Rules framed by the faculty and Representatives of founders of the university, and approved by the Board of Trustees. The system, makes organisational goals and individual (teachers') goals tend to converge. For example, all teachers feel motivated to work collectively for quality assurance. To ensure quality, admission of students is selective and no students who fail in the admission test is allowed to study at the university only on revenue or other considerations. Deviation from such a practice would indicate poor management, short-sightedness or corruption in the admission process. If such malpractice prevails good teachers will feel discouraged to join such a university. Teachers of high standing would demand sufficient opportunities for faculty governance to ensure participation of teachers in decision-making in university management through various committees. The Private University Act 2010 provides guidelines indicating how to institutionalise faculty governance and good governance in general. While faculty governance works at the enterprise ( University) level, the good governance extends further. It covers the working relationships between the university, University Grants Commission and Ministry of Education and Chancellor's Office. It is the teachers who can effectively comply with the conditions for good governance as stipulated the 2010 Act. They however, need the cooperation of the founders of the university in this regard. The point made here is that there are many conditions, including recruiting reputable teachers, that must be fulfilled to make a university good one. Most of these conditions have been indicated above. Of them, hiring and retaining high profile teachers stand out. Good teachers demand supports from the management as mentioned above. Once a critical mass of good teachers continues serving, the university attains the image of the globally competitive university. Therefore, I conclude that the university authority should assign higher priority to hire and retain high profile professors. This process will fulfill other conditions to make the university a world class university. ............................................................................

{"title": "Why Asians Should Take Medical Advice to Heart", "body": "Lifestyle changes in the wake of urbanisation probably bear the main responsibility for South Asia's heart disease epidemic, says a prominent Sri Lankan specialist. The phenomenon is particularly sad because, until now, the genetic predisposition of the peoples of this region to the risk of heart attacks has been kept under control by their traditional ways of living. The typical Asian villager is slim, has low cholesterol and rarely suffers from diabetes. Transfer such folk into an urban setting - whether in Colombo, Calcutta or California - and soon the additional consumption of calories and fat, the increased level of stress and the low level of physical exercise contribute to a huge prevalence of coronary heart disease. \"It is imperative,\" says Professor Shanthi Mendis of the department of medicine at Sri Lanka's Peradeniya University, \"that nations such as ours take steps to control obesity and increase physical activity in our populations.\"One of the most important measures to prevent coronary heart disease is the promotion of healthy eating habits. Unfortunately, people are often subject to a confusing and contradictory array of information about foods such as sugar, coconut oil, salt and coffee. Part of the problem is caused by the food industry. When scientifically proven advice threatens profits, manufacturers of unhealthy foods lobby fiercely, encouraging misinformation campaigns, attempting to discredit the evidence. The traditional Asian diet, rich in fruit and vegetables, contains plenty of antioxidants such as flavinoids and plant sterols, which help prevent clogging of blood vessels. The fast-food restaurants that have sprouted up all over cities in the Indian subcontinent could spell disaster for the younger generation because the foods they sell are heavy with fat and salt. Deepa Joseph, a dietician, points out that a jogger burns up 15 calories per minute, but eating 100 grams of chips takes in 600 calories. \"So if you think you can get rid of this excess energy by exercising, you will have to jog for 40 minutes just to burn up this snack.\"How much exercise is necessary to prevent coronary heart disease?A cardiologist, Sanath Wickremesinghe, advises: \"Thirty minutes of moderate activity - such as brisk walking, gardening, cycling or swimming - on three or four days of the week is the current recommendation. \"Even if you cannot achieve this much, you will certainly reduce your risk of coronary heart disease by increasing your physical activity.\"But it is not easy for sedentary town-dwellers to develop active habits, as most people find that relaxing at home and travelling by vehicle is far more attractive than walking. Consuming excess salt is known to increase blood pressure, which is a potent cause of coronary heart disease. Deepa Joseph says: \"Most folk eat far more salt than they require - so cutting down extra salt is important.\"Alcohol is also a potent killer. While one drink a day - a glass of wine, half a pint of beer or a single measure of spirits - provides a moderate protective effect, a doctor's advice to \"take an occasional drink\" can easily be misinterpreted. Such advice, capitalised on by the liquor industry, can encourage excessive intake, which can increase blood pressure and cause a chronic heart-muscle disorder known as cardiomyopathy. Cigarette firms, while doing a tiny bit of good by sponsoring sports activity, continue to cause an incredible amount of harm. \"Nowadays,\" says Conly Bost, an anti-smoking campaigner in North Carolina in the United States, \"they are not only directing their activities towards poor countries with a vengeance, they are also dumping cigarettes with a very high nicotine and tar continent in Asia and Africa.\"Since victims of cigarette-induced diseases in places such as the US have successfully sued tobacco giants for millions of dollars, and since government controls in economically less-developed countries are far less stringent, the tobacco companies have now turned to the markets of the highly populated Third World. As for cholesterol, it is still too early to know if reducing levels too much is dangerous. So the widespread use of expensive drugs for countering natural fats known as lipids cannot be recommended. For people with a very high cholesterol and triglyceride level, such drugs - when recommended by a competent doctor - are certainly useful. Colombo cardiologist Dr Rohantha de Silva says: \"It's important that people understand that these are not drugs to be taken for one or two months and then stopped. They have to be taken for a long period, possibly permanently, to exert their beneficial effect.\"Perhaps the most important factor in preventing coronary heart disease is for people - especially young people - to be aware of the problem and to become motivated enough to want a healthy lifestyle. Otherwise the current epidemic will see increasing numbers of people from south Asia dying of preventable heart disease in their 40s and 50s.

In Narail district about 100 'Pal' (potter) families used to create and supply various clays like plates, pots, dolls, flower tubs and many other utensils. Forty to fifty years back there was a great demand of these items all over Bangladesh including West Bengal, India and Pakistan.

They were also invited by the people from different areas of country to make Hindu goddess. They were awarded many presentations and gold medals in those days. But at present these potters are no more in demand. Still some of their sons and grand sons are struggling hard to survive pursuing their original profession facing a lot of problems. They are leading their lives with great poverty. The demising process of their trade is mainly due to acute scarcity of necessary implements and also of fuel.

A PDB official yesterday said they have already conveyed its stand to the ministry to terminate the US-based Smith Cogeneration for its failure to comply with the contract. The PDB is awaiting the Energy Ministry's final decision in this regard. \"Smithco did not comply with the contract...We've no option but to terminate it,\" said the official. But the high-ups in the Energy Ministry are divided over the issue, an Energy official hinted. One section is lobbying to avoid termination of the contract with Smithco allowing the company to work here without paying compensation, while the other section supports the PDB stand. At a meeting in the ministry yesterday, PDB again strongly advocated for terminating the US company as it did not fulfil the contract signed on October 14, 1997. As per the agreement, the company was scheduled to build a 100-MW barge mounted power plant at Haripur near Dhaka within 10 months of the signing the contract. In case of failure, they are liable to pay a fine of 10,000 US dollar per day. The delay fine totalled 3.5 million US dollar and PDB asked the company to pay the amount plus 8.5 million dollar as liquidity damage latest by January 17 to keep the contract valid. But the company did not agree to pay the amount till yesterday, rather they are making various pleas to somehow continue with the job, officials said. PDB identified fund crisis as the main problem of Smithco as it could not yet find a financier, but Smithco officials said they have recently got a good financier. \"If so, why don't they pay 12 million US dollar as delay fine and liquidity damage?\" asked another PDB official.

City police officials said at present more than six lakh illegal rickshaws are plying on the city streets. At the same time, hundreds of autorickshaws from the city's peripheral townships have come to the city only to make the traffic situation worse, they added. Traffic police also blamed 'irresponsible motorists' for the worsening traffic congestion. They said most of the private cars found on the city streets carried only one or two passengers. The number of such 'luxury cars' rushing for the shopping centres are also increasing every day as the Eid nears. Most of the shopping centres do not have parking place and these are parked on the roads. A traffic department official advised the citizens to try to use public transports such as taxis, buses and such other vehicles as much as possible. The authorities now find themselves in a dilemma. They cannot decide whether to divert their limited manpower and resources to crack down on the illegal vehicles or to keep city arteries clear of the gridlock. In every shift, less than 400 traffic policemen are manning different points in the city. Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) officials, however, brushed aside the police claim of six lakh illegal rickshaws. They said in addition to 80,500 licensed rickshaws 'there are at the most three lakh illegal rickshaws on the city streets.' \"As in every year, this is the peak season for rickshawpullers,\" one official said. \"Thousands of rural people come to the city to pull rickshaws during this season and no rickshaws are lying idle in any garage,\" said a Revenue Department official of the DCC. Another official admitted that DCC did 'never' have any firm policy to control rickshaws although it is the sole authority for this. \"The DCC caught only a small number of rickshaws when the press started writing but all was mere white wash,\" said a DCC official. \"Every time a clamp down started, a section of rickshawpullers started demonstrating in front of the Nagar Bhaban and the operation was instantly stopped.\" In view of the present traffic situation, DCC has given a list of 100 illegal rickshaw makers in the city to the city police. Police sources said they were trying to control making of rickshaws but were unable to do it 'satisfactorily' due to manpower constraint. So far they caught 100 illegal rickshaws in the city. While rickshaws were apparently taking most of the blame for the gridlock, in most cases illegal autorickshaws were going unpunished. Apart from one or two points in the city, there is no check point for autorickshaws. Rajuk officials noted that with the rapid expansion of the city, adequate number of roads were not constructed. Plans for new roads remain shelved because no government implements those fearing that land acquisition at the prime city spots would make it unpopular. \"The volume of traffic in such a big city cannot be accommodated by the existing roads,\" said one official.

The Indo-Bangla joint venture will develop block No. 2 and 5, which span over 65 acres and 29 acres of land respectively, on a design, finance, own, operate and transfer basis. Summit Technopolis will invest $114.56 million for block-2 and $93.03 million for block-5. The company will have to start construction of the physical infrastructure of the two blocks within three months and complete the whole development work within 10 years, according to the deal. The developers will have to start handing over a part of their physical infrastructure within the next two years so that they can be leased out to ICT companies. Summit Technopolis will finalise a design this week and will go for the construction work as soon as possible, Khan said. A deal will be signed soon with Fiber@Home for block No. 3 soon, said Hosne Ara Begum, managing director of Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority. The block is spread across 40 acres. The tender evaluation is ongoing for block No. 4, which is located over 36 acres, she added. The authority has set aside block No. 1, which spans across 65 acres, for its own use. The government is hopeful of creating 60,000 new jobs in this park in ten years. “We hope the hi-tech park will change the economy of the country,” Zunaid Ahmed Palak, state minister for ICT, said at the signing ceremony. The project is as part of the government's efforts to move the country toward a digital economy. Initiated in 1999 by the Awami League government, the hi-tech park project was not continued by the subsequent government. The project got a fresh lease of life in 2009, when the AL returned to power.

{"title": "Bush faces uphill Senate battle on economic plan", "body": "President George W. Bush's 10-year, 674-billion-dollar economic plan faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where his party holds only a thin majority and some Republicans are joining opposition Democrats in challenging the proposal. Sensing a congressional dissatisfaction with the plan, Bush on Thursday defended the need for speedy tax cuts and abolishing dividend taxes as a blueprint for growth and employment. \"This is a plan to encourage growth, focusing on jobs,\" he said, insisting his proposal would create 2.1 million jobs over the next three years. \"The role of government is not to create wealth, but to create an environment in which the small business can grow to be a big business, in which people are comfortable about investing,\" Bush said. But centrist lawmakers on both sides of the Senate aisle are worried about the effect such generous tax cuts would have on the rising deficit and whether they would have any significant stimulative effect. \"I can't see us giving away any more of our revenue,\" Republican Lincoln Chafee said, adding that Bush could face \"problems\" in getting his economic agenda passed. When the country had a surplus, he said, as when Congress passed Bush's last tax cut effort in 2001, such a bill was easier to pass because lawmakers thought the country could afford it. \"I don't think anyone shares that now,\" Chafee said. Twelve Democrats voted in favor of Bush's 10-year, 1.35-trillion-dollar tax cut in 2001. Three are no longer in the Senate, but more than half of the remaining nine have said the current Bush proposal is too expensive and not sufficiently stimulative in the near term. \"They cannot pass the bill in the Senate,\" said Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat who was a key broker of the 2001 tax cut package. California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who voted for that package, explained that circumstances had changed. \"9/11 had not taken place, war had not appeared on the horizon, revelations of corporate fraud had not surfaced and a recession was not evident,\" she said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bush-faces-uphill-senate-battle-on-economic-plan", "date": "2003-01-11T00:00:29+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 338},

Photo: Courtesy With a quest of keeping their hope of qualifying alive, Bangladesh will be eying a big win against lowly Northern Mariana Island in their third and final Group D match of the AFC Challenge Cup Qualifiers at 3:30 pm (BST) at the Dasarath Stadium in Kathmandu, Nepal today. Bangladesh will have a large interest on the result of the other match between Nepal and Palestine as a win for Nepal, coupling with a win for Bangladesh, might see them go through as group champions. The two best runners-up from five groups, along with five group champions, will advance to the final round. After two games apiece, Palestine are on top in the group with six points and need a single point in today's tie against Nepal to go through to the finals as group champions. Bangladesh will need a win over Mariana Island to finish runners-up in the group and will have to wait for the results of other four groups to learn their fate. The matches of two other groups will also be finalised today while the matches of the remaining two groups have not started yet. Apart from those equations, Bangladesh can dream of going to the finals as group champions, subject to winning by a big margin against Mariana Island and a Palestinian defeat to Nepal. In that case, Bangladesh will have to beat lowly Mariana Island by 9 or more goals and Nepal will have to beat Palestine by at least one goal. Whatever the equation is, Bangladesh are looking forward to posting their second successive victory by beating Mariana Island, who conceded 6-0 and 9-0 defeats against Nepal and Palestine respectively. The Bangladesh players were upbeat in the training session yesterday after beating Nepal 2-0 on the previous day and will be looking to take that encouragement to the match against Mariana Island. “The victory over Nepal is very motivating for the players, who also had to beat some 20,000 Nepalese who were in the stadium. Our boys played really well and I hope that they will carry it to the next match,” said Bangladesh's Dutch coach Lodewijk de Kruif yesterday. “Northern Mariana Island seems to be an easy opponent but we want to play our natural game and win the match,” said De Kruif. Having conceded 15 goals in two matches, Mariana Island's coach Koo Luam Khen is thinking of protecting his backline and go into counter-attack to find their maiden goal in the tournament. “We know Bangladesh are a very strong side and we will be trying to work hard on our defence and then hope for a good result,” said Khen.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/booters-take-on-mariana-today", "date": "2013-03-06T00:00:57+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 486},
{"title": "Remittance hits record $15.31b", "body": "In the just concluded fiscal year, migrant workers sent home $15.31 billion in remittance, the highest in the country's history. The remittance in 2014-15 also rose 7.6 percent from $14.23 billion in the previous fiscal year, according to Bangladesh Bank (BB) statistics released yesterday. A huge increase in manpower export, backed by the central bank's proactive measures to facilitate the inflow through formal channel, is believed to have driven the remittance growth. \"The higher inflow of remittance is the outcome of our continuous effort of the last couple of years,\" BB Governor Atiur Rahman said in a statement. The central bank along with the commercial banks has worked hard round the year aiming to increase the flow of inward remittance from across the world, he said. Stable exchange rate of the Bangladeshi taka against the US dollar has also helped achieve the steady growth in remittance inflow, Atiur Rahman explained. \"Delivery channel of inward remittances to the beneficiary has improved significantly because of the bank-led effective mobile banking under the leadership of BB,\" the governor added. Bangladesh received $1.43 billion remittance in June alone, up by $109.98 million from that of the previous month, according to the central bank. While proposing the budget for the 2015-16 FY in parliament on June 4, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said Saudi Arabia had re-opened its labour market to Bangladeshi workers after a six-year hiatus, indicating future growth prospects for manpower export. Remittance sent by more than eight million migrant workers plays a crucial role in the country's economy, helping reduce the overall incidence of poverty as well as maintaining a healthy balance of payments. According to a recent study by the World Bank, remittance has helped reduce the poverty level in Bangladesh by 1.5 percent. It also accounts for about 66 percent of the country's foreign currency reserves, providing Bangladesh with a strong and stable external position.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/remittance-hits-record-1531b-106567", "date": "2015-07-03T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 314},

{"title": "Lynching incident after a lull", "body": "Catching an alleged mugger and setting him on fire by pouring kerosene all over his body at Mirpur last Monday night raked up a nightmarish memory. We can't forget that not so long ago lynching became a regular occurrence just about anywhere in the country. But mostly alleged muggers would either be beaten to death or set on fire by angry crowds in broad daylight in the capital city. At that time, the violent mob action against suspected snatchers was put down to public frustrations over a general deterioration in the law and order situation. But the latest incident took place at a time when petty crimes like mugging had come down to a considerable extent, especially since the operation by the joint forces began in October. But the fact is the potential for such incidents lurks and that's where we need to be on guard. Police said that there was no case against him, though the local people alleged that he was involved in criminal activities. Therefore, it is only natural for us to wonder whether he was a victim of enmity. It is not impossible for anyone to frame someone and instigate the onlookers against that person. We have seen how ugly mob temper can get in such situations. But we are yet to know for sure whether those who had been lynched earlier on were all real criminals or several of them were just victims of circumstances. We think the police could have played an effective role in preventing this happening. There should have been proper investigations into the unnatural deaths that had occurred in the past. If only those cases were seriously gone into, people would have thought twice before taking law into their own hands. At the same time, we would also urge the citizens to be respectful of rule of law; they should realise that beating someone to death or setting him on fire amounts to murder.

{"title": "Chairman proposes, minister opposes", "body": "Less than a week after the announcement that he would welcome newsmen at all meetings of the parliamentary bodies he heads, Suranjit Sengupta had to face strong opposition yesterday from a minister who is a member of the committee he chairs. The minister opposed Sengupta on two grounds - procedural as well as practical problems. While giving a lecture on the need for transparency in parliamentary activities, Sengupta announced on January 7 last: \"From now on, I welcome newsmen at all meetings of the parliamentary committees I head.\" Sengupta is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. The committee met yesterday afternoon. Some reporters did not fail to be present at the venue. But contrary to Sengupta's public announcement, meeting of the JS body began only after the reporters had left the room at the request of the legislators concerned. Law Minister Abdul Matin Khashru argued that there was no scope for inviting newsmen at the committee meetings \"unless certain provisions of the JS Rules of Procedure - the Bible for parliamentary practices - are changed\". He quoted a couple of rules - 199 and 201 - which do not support Sengupta's view. Rule 199 of the JS Rules of Procedure says: The sittings of a Committee shall be held in private. Rule 201 says: All persons other than members of the Committee and officers of the Parliament Secretariat shall withdraw whenever the committee is delivering. Sengupta, however, tried to take refuge in Rule 213 (I) that says: A committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure. Explaining, Sengupta said that the rule empowered a committee to independently decide as to how it would function. But the minister did not take time to interpret the rule in a different manner. Quoting the second part of the rule, the minister said that the rule actually empowered the committee to invite experts, not journalists. Rule 213 (II) says, \"A committee may obtain cooperation and advice from any expert in its respective field, if deemed necessary.\" The minister \"welcomed\" Sengupta's spirit of making the committee activities more transparent. But he said, \"If the meetings are open to journalists, I am afraid, the present level of effectiveness of the committee meetings would be affected. May be, it will inspire many of us to play to the gallery, rather than concentrate on the issues to be discussed at the meeting.\" He however told the meeting that journalists could be invited to attend some \"selective\" meetings, not all. Barrister Jamiruddin Sircar, a BNP member on the committee, believes that the meetings of the JS bodies, especially the one dealing with the judiciary, should be open for all. On the question of the restriction as stated by the minister, Sircar said: \"The rules are not mandatory. Those are rather directory.\" However, the issue remained unresolved. A senior ruling party member on the committee, Advocate Rahmat Ali, suggested that the Speaker be consulted on the controversial issue. Meanwhile, the committee members present at the meeting reached a consensus that senior lawyers having good reputation could be appointed High Court judges on temporary basis. \"It will help fight the back-log of cases pending trial in the High Court,\" the Law Minister told The Daily Star yesterday evening. \"However, the appointments will be made if the Chief Justice agrees to the proposition. Besides, we will seek opinion of other experts.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/chairman-proposes-minister-opposes", "date": "1999-01-13T00:00:37+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 570},

{"title": "When Terror Strikes, What is the Government's Worth?", "body": "SHAMSUR Rahman has put his escape from the jaws of death on Jan 18 last down as a \"miracle\". And well he might. This was an atrocity waiting to happen, and it was a matter of miracle indeed that the intended target escaped unhurt. The crude attack on Rahman at his family residence has certainly shocked the saner segment of the population. But it would be a fallacy to suggest that many were surprised. The danger signals have been there for all to observe for a long time; threats, some thinly veiled, others pretty brazen, have been made against intellectuals of secular disposition in public for years. Such threats had become shriller and more blatant in recent years. But the response of the State, which carries the sole responsibility to protect the lives and freedoms of citizens, has been characterised by complacency verging on abettment. At the same time, the lack of surprise has been accompanied by total incredulity over the inept performance of the various security-related intelligence agencies. Bangladesh may not be much of a player in the regional or global strategic game, but Dhaka does boast an array of such agencies. The police has the Special Branch, the defence establishment has the Directorate General-Forces Intelligence (DGFI) in addition to the Military Intelligence (MI). The home ministry also has the National Security Intelligence (NSI). With all such intelligence agencies deployed in various roles, it is rather surprising that none of these managed to get a tip on the plans to assassinate Shamsur Rahman. The assassins did not come from another planet, nor did they carry out their activities in total secrecy. Fundamentalist groups such as the so-called Harkatul Jihad lay out their stores in public, propagate their politics of hate through journals published from offices with signboards. They even boast of their connections with militant groups in Afghanistan or Kashmir. One would certainly have expected intelligence services such as the SB, NSI and DGFI to keep a close watch on them, particularly since they may have links with foreign terrorist groups. Unfortunately, the attempt on Rahman demonstrated that the security services were not carrying out any such surveillance on these fanatic groups, nor were they subjected to any of the mundane tactics used by intelligence agencies such as infiltration to gather information. Had that been done, the murder ring would have been broken before Rahman's life was put in danger. In fact, the failure of the intelligence services to gather information on the fanatic groups' para-military training, arms procurement and planning for assassinations, probably had more to do with political dishonesty and opportunism of governments, past and present. This has not only allowed parties on the fundamentalist fringe to gain political legitimacy and moral strength, it has also left intellectuals to without real protection. Intellectuals are no strangers to death in Bangladesh. The liberal, secular ideology Bengalee intellectuals have traditionally propounded has ensured that they remain prime targets of religious fanatics and neo-fascist political elements. The murder of the intellectuals by the Pakistan army and their Al-Badr death squads in December 1971, is merely the most dramatic expression of the intolerance and hate that the fanatics propagate in order to stifle freedoms of expression and thought. Over the past two decades and more, the forces behind the attempt to murder Rahman have been allowed to grow both in strength and audacity right before the very eyes of the State and society. Apologists of the State would say that the growth of religious fanaticism has been \"tolerated\", on the grounds of freedom of expression and thought. However, there is a gulf of difference between promotion of a political ideology based on religious teachings, and propagation of an ideology that uses religion to incite hate and intolerance, and tries to stifle intellectual freedom through threats of violence or actual violence. Those who have been at the helm of the State's affairs since secularism was deleted from the Constitution in 1977, unfortunately, have not acknowledged this difference. Since 1979, both the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the civil war in Afghanistan have inspired the growth of religious fanaticism in Bangladesh. Such groups are on the fringe of the political spectrum, as they have never been able to generate support among the general masses. But they have been able to recruit a fairly large number of fanatics, mostly from the madrasas who apparently have no stake in the functioning of a democratic State, and even less in the liberal, enlightened tradition of Bangladesh. The politics they pursue is a new brand of fascism, which uses religion as the motivating element, rather than nationalism. The danger that fanatical groups pose to the lives and freedoms of liberal and secular intellectuals has been known for decades. The true character of these fanatics became visible they launched a street campaign against the writer Taslima Nasreen in 1994 and targeted the daily Janakantha newspaper. The extraordinary degree of intolerance became apparent when they attempted to whip up a hate psychosis directed against the tiny Ahmadiya community numbering around 100,000 in Bangladesh. During all these, the State acted as a by-stander, watching passively as small fanatic groups publicly threatened the lives and freedoms of other individuals and communities. The signal sent by this passive non-reaction of the State in the mid-90s was a dangerous one. It meant that fascistic politics of hate, even incitement to murder, would be tolerated. The idea was to create a cowed environment in which intellectuals would be terrorised into silence. The State virtually abdicated its responsibility to protect citizens' fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. Since 1996, however, there has been a marked decline in the overt activities of these fundamentalist groups. The rout of the Jamaat-i-Islami in the June elections that year had clearly demonstrated that the people of Bangladesh had little time for fanaticism. The non-Jamaat camp of the religious Right, which contains a number of tiny Taliban look-alike groups, has never been in the electoral game. Their strength is based on their hold on the madrasas which provide fertile ground for breeding fanatics. But their biggest strength has been the government's unwillingness to tackle them head-on. In recent years, the audacity displayed by these groups has naturally reminded people of the days of 1971, when blood-curdling warnings against intellectuals by Jamaat leaders, through speeches to the faithful and articles in their mouthpiece daily Sangram, had preceded the December massacre. Such threats are heard at public meetings quite regularly these days, but without provoking the slightest bit of preventive action from the government. It is clear that these so-called Taliban groups are basically terror-oriented with an intent to murder. Therefore, there is no reason to treat them as \"political\" elements, and every reason to tackle them as a law and order issue under the country's criminal code. The attempt on Rahman's life has demonstrated that there is no scope to play the opportunist political game that has been played over the past two decades and more. Such opportunism has nurtured the Frankenstein that is now threatening to compromise the most fundamental element of a civilised, democratic society: freedom of thought and expression. The Jan 18 incident has the potential to blow the lid on a number of issues. First is the question of whether \"political\" parties which incite hate should be allowed to function. Second is whether madrasas should be brought under the direct supervision of the education boards, or whether madrasas should be kept at all. Third is whether the time has come for Bangladesh to seriously scrutinise the role of some foreign diplomatic missions and NGOs and their links to fundamentalist groups. But the question that requires immediate answer relates to the role of the government itself. It is not a matter of putting police guards at the doors of selected individuals. Such \"protection\" is illusory, because it does not address the core issues at stake. Unless fanatical groups are uprooted, the threat to the lives of the likes of Shamsur Rahman will remain real. If the government wishes to protect freedoms of expression and thought, then it has little choice but to act against fundamentalist groups known to propagate ideologies of violence and intolerance. If it does not, then the words of a highly respected intellectual, spoken more in frustration than anger, would look prophetic. \"This government is worthless\", he had said. Perhaps Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would like to demonstrate to the public the worth of her government.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/when-terror-strikes-what-is-the-governments-worth", "date": "1999-01-27T00:00:43+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1411},
{"title": "Fourth Test from today", "body": "CAPE TOWN, Jan 1: After spending three days in the third Test in hot and humid Durban, England's battle-weary troops will be hoping captain Nasser Hussain will win the toss and choose to bat in the fourth Test against South Africa, which begins Sunday, reports AP. Ordinarily, English players are used to playing successive cricket matches. But the grind of Test cricket is not what they're used to. Having had South Africa on the rack during the second, third and fourth days of the third Test, only to be thwarted by a double century by Gary Kirsten, the England players will be wondering just how to get South Africa down and then deliver the coup de grace. \"I'm pleased with the way things are going,\" said Hussain after the Durban draw, the second of the series, which South Africa lead 1-0. That said, he needs to reflect on the way in which Kirsten was able to completely shut the English bowlers out during his marathon 14-hour 38-minute 275-run innings in Durban. Even the marauding Andrew Caddick was unable to penetrate the Kirsten defence, and, as Hussain said, \"Caddick was the one bowler who extracted life from a good batting pitch.\" With Kirsten playing the fourth Test on his home ground, and South Africa buoyed by the comprehensive manner in which they saved the third Test, it is England, rather than South Africa, who will be asking questions about their team selection. Alan Mullally is fit to bowl again, and, because Chris Silverwood has not worked out despite his pace, that is an obvious change to make, especially since it is believed South African batsmen struggle against left-handed quick bowlers. But, having flown Mark Ramprakash out to cover for the injured Michael Vaughan, and with Mark Butcher still having a wretched tour with the bat, the England management may be tempted to play both the now-recovered Vaughan and Ramprakash for Butcher and Darren Maddy. That's a lot of changes for a side which came so close to victory, and doesn't even take into account the fact that Darren Gough has yet to bowl with anything like the conviction he once had. South Africa, on the other hand, will note they went into the Durban Test top-heavy with bowlers, and probably will recall Jonty Rhodes for Mornantau Hayward. The young fast bowler will take heart from the knowledge that Allan Donald is reaching the end of his storied career. That means the rookie will soon join forces with Shaun Pollock to form South Africa's opening attack in the new millennium. It means more bowling responsibilities for Jacques Kallis and Lance Klusener, both of whom will have to add some wicket-taking skills to their almost indispensable batting contributions. It also means captain Hansie Cronje will have to bowl more effectively at Test level to offset his lack of batting success recently. \"My own lack of scores recently is embarrassing,\" he admitted, \"but I hope Newlands and 2000 will bring a change in fortunes.\" Rhodes' return will be welcomed by a local public which was stunned by his omission after he scored two half-centuries, one unbeaten, in the drawn second Test in Port Elizabeth. Both came as South Africa's batting was under pressure.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/fourth-test-from-today", "date": "2000-01-02T00:00:45+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 539},
{"title": "'Zakat' and 'Sadaqa': Their Right on Our Wealth:", "body": "WE all know that it's obligatory for well-to-do persons to give 'zakat' at the rate 2 per cent on his savings for a period of 12 months. Many among the rich pay their 'zakat' but they do so on a rough estimate of their accumulated wealth, property and other assets. Calculation of the amount of 'zakat': But the above is not the right way of giving away one's 'zakat'. The amount to be given away in 'zakat' must be calculated on various items: 1) amount of gold (if in excess of 7 tola or 82 gm), amount of silver (in excess of 52 tola or 577 gm), shares, fixed deposits, cash in bank, cash in shops, earnings from the renting of property, house(s) provided the above items are in possession of the person for one year. 'Zakat' on agricultural crops: The 'zakat' on the produce of non-irrigated land is 10 per cent and on that of irrigated land 5 per cent. On farm animals also 'zakat' is due. Only a few calculate the amount and give it when it is due. Muslims select the month of 'Ramadan' to give 'zakat' because in the eyes of Allah any charity given in this month is rewarded 70 times over compared to 10 times when it is given during the remaining period of the year. What is 'sadaqa'? In addition to 'zakat', wealthy persons of the community are enjoined to give away a part of their accumulated wealth to one's parents, poor relatives, the needy, the destitute. Such a charity is 'sadaka' which also includes 'zakat'. 'Zakat' is compulsory whereas charity is optional. So, if a person can contribute to the needy, in addition to what is due on him on account of 'zakat', it will be ideal because there are certain rules guiding the distribution of 'zakat' ('zakat' money cannot be given to a needy individual on a month to month basis nor to repairing his house or construction of any building even if the latter may be used for a worthy or noble cause), whereas charity could be used for any worthy purpose. Who are eligible for your 'sadaqa'? 'Sadaqa' is meant to help your parents, your poor relatives, those who suffer from extreme financial crisis such as Muslim children who have no means to finance their study in schools, colleges, or a university, or a widow or an orphan, or a neo-Muslim abandoned by his/her community for accepting Islam, or to help people heavily in debt or for construction of a charitable institution or for its renovation etc. In verse 273 of the Baqarah, Allah enjoins us to help those who do not come out in the open for help because of their modesty. Such a situation arises when all of a sudden the husband of a family dies leaving practically nothing for his widow and minor children. The widow will never ask for charity because of her modesty. The author knows an instance when a young lawyer was murdered in broad day light in Dhaka and there was not enough savings for the widow to meet both ends. Hardly anybody came forward to help her. In such circumstances, it will be the duty of the wealthy to find them out and help their rehabilitation. Squandering money is prohibited in Islam: Many of us spend money lavishly on occasions like marriage, anniversary, birthday party. Allah warns those who waste money and says that those who squander money are the brothers of Satan (Isra: 27). Instead, a part of this money should be spent in charity to champion the cause of needy, the destitute, poor students who cannot defray their educational expenses. The wealthy are enjoined to give 'sadaqa' and the reward of such a charity: Allah enjoins the believers to spend out from bounties He has provided to the wealthy before it is too late; \"when the Day comes no bargaining, no pleading nor any friendship\" will help such person to gain Allah's Mercy (cf. Baqarah: 254). On the other hand, if we spend money in charity, Allah will reward us profusely. In this connection let us analyze the verse 261 of 'Baqarah'. In this verse, the fruits of charity are compared to a grain or a seed; when sown, it gives rise to a plant with seven tillers/branches and each branch in turn bears 100 grains. No boasting for your charity: Allah does not want us to brag what we give in charity nor should we show off what we give away in charity (Baqara: 264). However, disclosing what is given in charity is well received in the eyes of Allah but it's best if it could be given to those who are in desperate need and away from the public eye (Baqarah:271). Reminding of your charity is forbidden: Being a donor we have also no right to create difficulties of any kind to the beneficiaries, nor should we harass them and hurt their feelings by our behaviour such as reminding them again and again that they are indebted to us (Baqarah:262). Worship is linked with kindness: To us the worship to Allah is linked with kindness: to parents, kindred, those in want, a traveler (who may be a total stranger). Those, who among us are wealthy, may think that it is up to us to oblige the poor, the needy, the destitute or our hard up relatives, or a stranded traveler, but our notion is wrong. If we have the means, it's incumbent on us to help them. As a practicing Muslim, we cannot dismiss this obligation. They have certain rights which must be fulfilled (Isra: 26). The verse clearly states that your parents, relations and even a stranger who may have lost his belongings during his travel have rights over your wealth and you cannot deny them.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/zakat-and-sadaqa-their-right-on-our-wealth", "date": "1999-01-18T00:00:15+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 970},
{"title": "Youths exude confidence", "body": "Bangladesh youth team leaves for the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo today with a pronounced intention of making a bigger impact than they did in South Africa when the World Youth Cricket Championship begins in the emerald islands from January 10. After pushing their way into the spotlight in South Africa two years ago, where they lifted the Plate title and defeated eventual champions England, the youngsters of Bangladesh appeared confident to cross the first round barrier and play in the elite eight-team super league, a feat they have never achieved. \"The success in South Africa was certainly a big achievement for us. But this time around we are keen to better our performance. We finished ninth in South Africa but now we are looking forward to playing in the Super League if not going all the way to win the trophy\", said the coach of the team Dipu Rai Chowdhury while talking to this reporter at the BKSP yesterday. Placed in Group B of the sixteen-nation meet, which includes youth teams from all the nine Test-playing countries, Bangladesh will play their first match against India on January 12. Bangladesh, who made it to the finals as winners of the Asian youth championships in Singapore last year, will play their second match against New Zealand on January 14. Bangladesh take on Holland in their last league match on January 18. Top two finishers from the four groups will advance into the Super league while the remaining eight will fight it out for the consolation Plate title. It is however a tough group fixture for Bangladesh where India are tipped as favourites. But Dipu feels that in an age group tournament the strength of the participating teams do not vary to the extent it does at the senior level. \"We are mentally tough enough to play against any opponent. I think that would be the motivating factor for us,\" said Dipu. Terming his side as an extremely talented one, the former national left-arm seamer said that batting would be the real strength of his team. Dipu however admitted that experience could be the vital ingredient missing in the team apart from the lack of match practice. The coach preferred to look on the positive side. \"This is true that we are not carrying experienced and over aged players like Al-Shahriar and Mehrab Hossain this time. I think this is a significant step and a victory for the team\", Dipu claimed. Bangladesh over the years have earned the dubious distinction of fielding over-aged players in age-limit competitions. This is for the first time the BCB is sending a genuine youth team. Apart from skipper Hannan Sarker, the squad doesn't have any player who made the trip to South Africa two years ago. Hannan, who played for Abahani last year, admitted that the present team will certainly miss the services of seasoned cricketers like Al-Shahriar and Mehrab, but looked determined to face the challenge. \"The presence of Al-Shahriar and Mehrab in South Africa was a great help for us. We will definitely miss their experience. But I think this is a more talented side then the previous one\", said Hannan. Replying to a query Hannan said that the wickets in Sri Lanka wound be more conducive for his team then the fast and bouncy pitches in South Africa. \"The South African wicket suited teams like New Zealand last time around. But this time they will find it extremely difficult negotiating with the slow and turning wickets of the sub-continent\", said Hannan while elaborating his teams chances of making it into the Super League. \" We are capable of defeating Holland. The toughest match for us in the first round should be against India\", felt the Bangladesh captain.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/youths-exude-confidence", "date": "2000-01-05T00:00:53+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 624},

Besides, about five thousand people have been attacked with diarrhoea which is still spreading fast in the areas to the great alarm of the people. The thanas affected with diarrhoea are Nagarkanda, Sadarpur and Bhanga. The most affected areas include Jhawdanga, Maniknagar, Kathia Baragram, Sadarbera, Sonatashic, Ramnagar, Bhojerdangi, Radhanagar and Dayarampur in Nagarkanda thana; Bhasan char, Sadarpur, Krishnapur, in Sadarpur thana and almost all the villages in Nurullahgonj union in Bhanga thana. When contacted the Civil Surgeon of Faridpur admitted the out break of diarrhoea in an epidemic form in the aforesaid areas, but he said that there was no official report of deaths. The Civil Surgeon, however, informed that several medical teams have been formed and sent to the affected areas to arrest the spread of the disease. UNB reports from Noakhali: Diarrhoea that broke out in the district in an epidemic form claimed 61 lives and affected about 3,000 people in the last month. Poor Development Programme, an NGO working for the development of poor here, in its survey report, published on January 5, said scarcity of drinking water and medicine, intake of stale foods and lack of awareness as the main reasons behind the outbreak of the disease. It said the affected people of the shoal areas are mostly landless and day labourers, so they have to depend on the treatment of village quacks. They do not get any help from the health workers or even any government or non-government assistance to check the disease. Meanwhile, Civil Surgeon Office here admitted 40 deaths and 2,000 affected by the water-borne disease. It said quick measures could not be undertaken to check the menace because of the information reached from the remote areas late. But, later the situation has been brought under control after directives by the civil surgeon, it added. This correspondent, however, witnessed an altogether a different scene while visiting some health complexes. The health complexes are lying abandoned as there were neither any doctor nor nurses and health workers excepting the night guards. Local people alleged that the doctors hardly visit the health complexes, rather they remain busy with their private practice in the town.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/diarrhoea-claims-30-in-faridpur-61-in-noakhali", "date": "1999-01-13T00:00:38+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 388},
{"title": "Cricketer sets girlfriend on fire", "body": "A female student of Ahsanullah University is fighting for life at a burn hospital in the city, after her boyfriend allegedly poured petrol and set her on fire. Monika Afroz Mimi 22, a third year student of architecture, was set on fire in front of her hostel at West Razabazar on Saturday afternoon. According to the witnesses, Mimi went out of her hostel, Mother Teresa Homes, 47/7 West Razabazar, and returned at about 2:00pm along with her boyfriend Shafiuddin Babu, a discarded national cricketer. Babu's friend Arif was accompanying them in the same rickshaw. Mimi asked the caretaker of the hostel, Khodabox, to call Shila, a boarder. \"Shila came out with a handbag, talked to them and handed over the bag,\" Khodabox told The Daily Star at the hostel yesterday afternoon. He said Mimi and the two young men left the hostel premises walking. About five to seven minutes later, I heard someone screaming nearby. I rushed to the spot, about 50 yards from the hostel, and found Mimi was burning, said Khodabox who with a few others present on the spot doused the flames with sands. They took her inside the hostel with most parts of her body badly burnt. Khodabox then called the superintendent of the hostel, Aklima Begum and took Mimi to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. As her condition deteriorated, she was later shifted to the City Hospital at Panthapath. Doctors said that about 75 percent of her body including the face were badly burnt. Her lungs and eyes were also affected. Several people, who witnessed the incident, said it was not an accident. \"The two youths poured petrol on Mimi's body, set her on fire and fled the scene immediately,\" they added. Mimi's elder brother Captain AS Masud Parvez, who came to the city from Rangpur on Sunday, blamed Babu and Arif for the incident. \"I came to know about the affair of my sister with Babu a couple of months ago. Mimi herself told me that she liked a cricketer,\" said a wailing Parvez at the City Hospital. Maruf Morshed Masum, younger brother of Mimi said Babu called him over phone about 11 hours after the incident and told that Mimi had committed suicide, pouring petrol on her body. Babu 29, a member of the Bangladesh team that took part in the 1999 World Cup in England, played his last match in the National League for Chittagong at the Fatullah Stadium on Thursday. But since Friday the strike bowler went missing. He failed to turn up for Saturday's regular practice session. \"We only learnt today that his name was linked to the tragic incident in which a young woman was allegedly set on fire\", said former national captain Minhazul Abedin. \"Whether he has done it or not, it has definitely brought shame on all cricketers,\" said the veteran all-rounder. Sources said Mimi engaged herself with Babu several months ago, and Babu used to visit the hostel to meet her. She was trying to manage Babu, after her elder brother asked her to forget the relationship and concentrate on her studies. Mimi had been staying at the hostel for six months. Captain Parvez filed a case with the Tejgaon Police Station Sunday accusing Babu and Arif of attempting to kill his sister. Both Babu and Arif have been missing since the incident. Police raided several places to arrest them, as they believe that the two are still hiding in the city. Sub-Inspector Jahangir Hossain is investigating the case. A container was recovered from the spot, which, according to police, was filled with petrol.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/cricketer-sets-girlfriend-on-fire", "date": "2003-01-07T00:00:56+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 598},
{"title": "Army pullout from tomorrow", "body": "The government will start pulling out the army tomorrow afternoon although the current anti-crime 'Operation Clean Heart' by the joint forces will go ahead, highly placed sources said. A special cabinet meeting with Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in the chair yesterday made the decision. It also approved the Joint Drive Indemnity Ordinance 2003, making army action during the anti-crime crackdown immune to legal challenge. Initially, the troops will be stationed in the divisional headquarters and cantonments. Some camps will be set up in places like Barisal where there is no cantonment. \"Troops will remain ready to swing into operation at the call of the civil administration. The current drive will carry on as long as deemed fit,\" said a senior army official on condition of anonymity. An influential cabinet minister confirmed it. Around 24,023 army men and 339 Navy personnel along with paramilitary BDR, police and Ansar joined in the 'Operation Clean Heart' drive from early hours of October 17 last year, aiming to quell violent crimes across the country. Some 44 people so far died during the joint drive while 11,245 were arrested, including 2,482 listed criminals. During the same period, 2,028 arms and 29,754 rounds of ammunitions were recovered. Sources at the civil and military administrations said although there are cantonments in Dhaka and Chittagong there may be some army camps outside the cantonments in these two major cities. Because the authorities still apprehend further breakout of violent crimes in absence of the army. However, army intelligence will keep vigil on the situation. Moreover, if need be the army may assist the Rapid Action Team (RAT) composed of highly trained policemen which is likely to swing into action from January 17. Sources said one of the reasons of troops pullout is that most soldiers will get busy with the winter exercise. Troops are to engage in the winter exercise which is crucial since their promotion and posting greatly depend on their performance in the exercise. Sources said the troops withdrawal goes along schedule and that it has nothing to do with the Union Parishad elections to get underway on January 25. Government policymakers believe the troops deployment has greatly contributed to a fall in crime incidents. But the deaths of more than 44 people following arrest and detention during the drive has drawn scathing criticism for the government.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/army-pullout-from-tomorrow", "date": "2003-01-10T00:00:53+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 390},

Commissioner of DCC ward No. 42 Salimullah Solu, who is accused in a number of cases, was being interrogated at the Mohammadpur army camp till filing of this report at 9:00pm. Earlier, at around 7:30pm, the joint forces arrested Solu, believed to be the ringleader of an organised crime cartel, during a raid on several houses in the area. Mastermind of multiple crimes, including murder, extortion, mugging and land-grab, Solu went into hiding when the army-led countrywide clampdown on criminals began October 17 last year. He is believed to be behind the recent surge in criminal activities in the Mohammadpur area. On Tuesday, Solu, his brother and members of his gang looted a slum in the Jahuri area at Mohammadpur. He managed to escape when police arrested four of his men from the slum. Police and local people say the ward commissioner may have engineered the murders of a ruling BNP leader and a contractor in the span of eight hours on Thursday. Solu was elected in the DCC elections of April 25 last. He allegedly killed rival contender, Jubo Dal leader Wahiduzzaman to ensure victory in the polls. Rivalry between them climaxed when Wahid, also with criminal records, refused to withdraw from the election despite Solu's repeated threats. A few days later on March 28, Wahid was gunned down on the Tajmahal Road. Solu was also shown arrested on December 29, 2001 in the Sajal Chowdhury murder case. He was also accused in Babul, Yunus, Gada Babul, Rafiq and ward commissioner Shahabuddin murder cases. Solu was arrested soon after the DCC polls and released on bail later.

{"title": "Cold wave victims deserve warm response", "body": "Bangladesh is a poor country with a population of more than 120 million. Almost 50 per cent of the total population are very poor landless people. As a result of remaining under chronic poverty level most of them are not even capable to buy food. Moreover, the country is well known for its '3 D', i.e. death, disease and disaster. CDR of this country is high not only because of disease, malnutrition, lack of food, medical services or others reasons; it is also because of natural disaster which causes hundreds of deaths each year. Sufferings of the thousands of the poor vulnerable multiply during the period of disaster. In our country, disasters are of two types, natural and social/man made. The poor people are always victims of both. Different types of natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, river erosion, cold wave, heat wave etc. hit Bangladesh each year and affect a huge number of people, especially those living in the charland and remote areas. At present, a severe cold wave since mid December 2002, is sweeping over northern India, Bangladesh and Nepal. This cold wave with cloudy sky and lowest temperature of this decade has almost paralysed the country; life has come to a standstill, cities and the countryside are enveloped by thick fog. The meteorological department says the cold wave may continue till the end of this month. During the period, the temperature of the country oscillated between 6 to 10 degree Celsius. In Joypurhat, local Agricultural Extension Department (AED) recorded minimum temperature of 3 degree Celsius on 30th December 2002. National dailies reported 77 deaths in a single day. No official death toll has been released but through media we come to know that more than 400 deaths have occurred during the last two weeks. Those who died were mostly elderly, infant and ailing persons. Diseases like Pneumonia, Diarrhoea, Asthma and other winter complications are emerging; about fifty thousand poor patients with pneumonia, diarrhoea and respiratory complications got admitted to different hospitals. This has caused sudden scarcity of medicine and warm clothes. Price of warm clothes has risen 2 or 3 times than before. Price of rice has short up by 3 to 4 taka per kilogram. Communication by water and land routes has been disrupted. Poor people are desperately trying to protect themselves by rucksack and hessian. Those living by the river side or in char lands are the most vulnerable. The situation is most painful for the landless and less homeless, marginal farmers, labourers, rickshaw pullers and others who cannot afford to buy any warm clothes. For warm clothes and other necessary support, the poor people of Rangpur surrounded the DC office last month. Due to thick fog and severe cold, potato and seedlings of Irri-Boro are being damaged in many places of the country. Let's see what our government is doing during this disaster situation. With the assistance of UNDP and UNICEF, Bangladesh government has a disaster management plan, which has two major objectives, a) Increase awareness at all levels of society concerning the practical ways of reducing disaster risks and losses and b) Strengthen national institutional capacity for disaster management committees at District, Upazila and Union levels. Our government has taken a 'Disaster Management Strategy', which is operated through enhancing the national disaster management capacity to address the various aspects of planning which includes prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery and development (rehabilitation and recovery) activities. The GoB has taken the following significant steps during the last few years for building up institutional capacity from the national to the village level: i) Establishment of a disaster management organisation named Disaster Management Bureau (DMB) in 1993; ii) Renaming of the Ministry of Relief and Rehabilitation as the Ministry of' Disaster Management and Relief (MDMR) and iii) Establishment of Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) at MDMR. The GoB also established 'Disaster Management Council and Committees' from national level to field level for overall disaster management. In the organisational structure at the national level there are National Disaster Management Council (NDMC), Inter-Ministerial Disaster Management Co-ordination Committee (IMDMCC), National Disaster Management Advisory Committee (NDMAC), Cyclone Preparedness Programme Implementation Board (CPPIB), Disaster Management Training and Public Awareness Building Task Force (DMTATF), Focal Point Operation Coordination Group for disaster management (FPOCG), NGO Coordination Committee on disaster management (NGOCC) and Committee for Speedy Dissemination of Disaster Related Warning/ Signals (CSDDWS). And in the organisational structure level at the field level there are District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC), Upazila Disaster Management Committee (UZDMC) and Union Disaster Management Committee (UDMC). To maintain proper co-ordination amongst the concerned ministries, government organisations and line agencies, and also to ensure their proper functioning during emergency, the government has formulated a set of mechanisms. A guidebook titled 'Standing Orders on Disaster' has been designed as a basic tool for the mechanisms to be operative. The standing orders outline the activities of each ministry, major agency/ department so as to handle emergency situations efficiently. In the efforts of making the mechanisms effective, clear and comprehensive, national policy on disaster management and natural disaster management plan have been designed for consideration by the government. The entire disaster preparedness mechanisms meet the requirements of clear policies, provide scope for implementation of the NDMC policies and decision by high levels IMDMCC on an inter-ministerial basis, incorporate the role of the MDMR as the responsible line ministry, provide for the integration of Armed Forces and reflect the crucial role of the DDMCs, UZDMCs and UDMCs. As the head of the NDMC our Hon'ble Prime Minister, while visiting China, ordered these committees to aid the poor sufferers from the government fund without declaring present situation as a disaster. The quantity of government support is so diminutive that it is too insufficient to meet the need. Administrative authority showed disregard to the poor people. The Hon'ble Prime Minister asked the rich and well-to-do individuals, organisations, industries and institutions to extend aid to the government fund for the sufferers, which attained insignificant response. None is concerned about the winter devil that can be termed as a killing machine. Country's intellectuals and civil society members maintain silence. Media coverage is also not adequate. Non-government organisations, except few, that work to establish human rights also seems to have become frozen in this cold. Perhaps, to them these 400 deaths make little sense. May be the reason is that those people who were death were landless and homeless poor. What about the international organisations? UNDP's goal in addressing \"countries in special development situations\" is to 'reduce the incidence and impact of complex emergencies and disasters, natural, environmental and technological, and to accelerate the recovery process towards sustainable human development'. In this context, UNDP's overall objectives in disaster reduction and recovery are to: a) achieve a sustainable reduction in disaster risks and the protection of development gains, b) reduce the loss of life and livelihood due to disaster and c) ensure that disaster recovery serves to consolidate sustainable human development. Other international development organisations that are working in Bangladesh so far have same types of goal and objectives in disaster situation; very appreciable. Then they might know why are they not conspicuous at this moment of crisis. Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) has taken some initiative which is also not sufficient. Why the major opposition party or the other progressive leftist or democratic parties are also not conspicuous at present, who will answer the question today? But, the fact is, the answer is not very important to those thousands of poor people. At this moment, they badly need warm clothes, blankets and medicines. By their side they need to see the government, NGOs, donors or all the people who talk about the poor people everyday in all seminars, meetings, workshops etc. often more than they talk about themselves. Our development planners must take this susceptible situation with most care because besides these deaths, this disaster will bring other problems soon. This disaster will be a cause of puss-footing migration which will affect the urban areas. Planners should take necessary initiatives to control the prices of goods, especially warm clothes and seasonal food crops. Damage of crops by heavy fog will cause scarcity of food items. Another major programme by the government and many other NGOs, i.e. family planning programme, will be hampered by this disaster. If the government cannot assure infants' life (whatever the reason of expiry) then rural poor will be interested for having more children as security, obviously. TFR (total fertility rate) will not reduce even though CPR (contraceptive prevalence rate) has enhanced. Worldwide over three million people have been killed in different natural disasters in the last two decades. Among these 90 percent of natural disasters occurred in the developing countries, where vulnerability of communities is too high. Inadequate physical infrastructure, environmental degradation and mismanagement, inappropriate territorial occupation and land use and concentration of populations in disaster sensitive zones are the major causes of increased physical, social and economic vulnerability to disasters. Chronic poverty, social and economic exclusion, rapid urbanisation and population growth, inadequate planning, weak administrative control systems and situations of civil conflict and economic transition directly influence these problems. Disaster loss, therefore, is synonymous with unresolved development problems. In turn, these losses further weaken the development asset base and draw scarce human and financial resources from addressing underlying vulnerabilities to meet humanitarian relief needs. The government and other development organisations should take immediate actions before it is too late. If the present situation continues even for a week, many more people will die in the nearer future. This is humanitarian and sensitive issue and this is the right time when we should stand beside thousands and thousands of poor sufferers in their awful time of need. Md.

{"title": "Bangladesh Bureaucracy : Accountability and Responsibility", "body": "In a developing country with a colonial past, bureaucracy plays a disproportionately prominent role in policy-making and enjoys a large range of discretionary powers. Due to political instability during the last 27 years Bangladesh could not develop any remedy to this situation except for the constitutional provision of Ombudsman and administrative tribunal. For an effective control system both legal and political mechanisms have to be combined. Legal mechanisms are more appropriate for preventing injustice than for securing redress. As extra constitutional checks like press, public opinion, and interest groups have not yet developed such redress depends very heavily on constitutional means in Bangladesh. Though Ombudsman Act came into force from April 1980 nothing tangible was done either during military-cum-civilian rule of Ershad or in the democratic regime of Khaleda Zia. The present government appears to be taking the Ombudsman issue seriously. To make the office of the Ombudsman really effective it may be necessary to make some amendments in certain provisions of the Ombudsman Act, particularly Section 15 of the Act which has empowered the Executive to exempt any public officer or class of public officers (as defined in Art. 152 of Bangladesh Constitution) from the operation of all or any of the provisions of the Act. The existing administrative tribunal should be more effective. Bureaucracy and Judiciary The interactions between the bureaucracies and courts are not seen as clearly as those between bureaucracies and the legislature or the bureaucracies and the executive. However, the courts' control over administrative actions is enormous. Some of the more important interactions are judicial review, control over administrative rule making, control over application and elaboration of administrative rules, control over administrative adjudications and checks on administrative biases. In Bangladesh the power of judicial review has been drastically restricted by Articles 47 and 102 (2) of the constitution and subsequent amendments in early 1979. Due to these measures the scope of other judicial reviews very often is too costly, too slow or too late to remedy a problem arising out of administrative activity. The threat of judicial review is a constraint that reduces the need for such review Bureaucracy and Legislature. The most important legislative controls over bureaucracy are usually statutes, appropriations and budgeting. The statutes may be used to activate many agencies, define their fields of activity and their organisational goals. Through the process of appropriations, the legislature can expand or contract the activities of agencies. The Bangladesh parliament has limited power in matters of administration as may be seen from Articles 76 (2), 82, 90, 91 and 93. Though article 76 (2) gives parliament the power to appoint standing committees to inquire into the activities of the ministries very limited powers under Articles 82, 89, 91 and 93 have made the parliament almost ineffective. The important reasons for limited public accountability of Bangladesh bureaucracy, as identified, are discussed below: a. The bureaucracy of a developing country with a colonial past holds more power than the bureaucracy of a developed country. As such there is greater danger of abuse of power by such a bureaucracy. b. British India did not give enough attention to public accountability because it was not needed in that pattern of administration. In Pakistan because of the dominance of bureaucracy upto 1971 accountability could not gain enough importance. This resulted in a gap between the bureaucrats and the politicians leading to rather maintenance of distance between the administration and the people. c. Due to lack of public accountability sometimes even a sound government policy fails. In India one of the main reasons for the fall of Indira government was over zealousness of the public servants for making family planning programmes successful. The movement for separatism started from the police firing during political agitation of 1952 (an act of administrative indiscretion) ultimately led to the creation of Bangladesh. d. It may not be appropriate to consider the US congressional budgeting procedures as a model for Bangladesh at this stage. But more detailed discussion on development budget is necessary for reducing wastage through modification or change in the resource allocation. In fact the people, particularly the elite, may be informed about the good intention of the government through such discussions. Because of political instability it may be advisable for Bangladesh to develop internal controls to contain the conflicts arising out of multiple organisational goals or to determine priorities in achieving them. Keeping in view the need for flexibility and openness to quicken the process of development the following measures are suggested: (i) Replacement of complete audits of all expenditures with selected audits of some expenditures will save the auditing forces a lot of time and effort. If the sampling technique is statistically well prepared it results in no significant loss in financial control. (ii) The present system of field inspection needs improvement. Field inspections may be made on an announced schedule basis. To an experienced and alert inspector, deception is not possible even if inspection is announced beforehand. The announced inspection does not create fear, distrust, and hostility, but encourages the positive and cooperative attitude which an organisation needs to perform in an optimally effective manner. (iii) The instructions issued should be less ambiguous to make them really effective. (iv) Though all the needs cannot be satisfied in designing a rule there is tremendous scope for ingenuity, expertise and sensitivity in devising new and improving old rules. (v) Like other bureaucracies, Bangladesh bureaucracy overreact to failure of internal communication. What is needed is better integration of objectives, particularly the major political objectives rather than procedural matters. There must be a balance between the needs for legality, accuracy etc. and the need to respond promptly politically sensitive objectives. Generally speaking, control has three main purposes: a) to ensure that bureaucracy carriers out its functions in accordance with goals determined; b) to ensure non-violation of general wishes of the citizenry; and c) to ensure elimination of arbitrary bureaucratic decisions violating individual rights. The administrators are expected to play an active role in improving public policies. As political actors they are expected to use their power resources to bring about outcomes in the public interest. In Bangladesh with its low rate of literacy and urbanisation the dominant pressure groups are counted in policy making. In such situation the concept of public interest can easily be neglected unless firmly grasped by administrators as an ethical imperative to guide decisions. A big gap exists between the policy makers' ideals of development and response to crisis in Bangladesh. This has generated strong social pressures to transform society. Such pressure may create violent dissatisfaction with the existing conditions. In a crisis-laden country such as Bangladesh responses to crisis tends to decrease the utility of majority participation in implementing critical decisions and increase the importance of bureaucratic expertise for defining problems and elaborating alternatives. Developed system of controls has weaknesses as well. The more important of them are: (i) it may lead to inefficiency; (ii) it may inhibit administrative innovation and enterprise; and (iii) it may create conflict and distrust. Like many other issues in social sciences it is difficult to give a clear-cut verdict on the issue of control of bureaucracy. Certain factors must be considered before giving any judgement on this issue. They are: (i) usually bureaucracy is relatively more developed organisation than any other organisation in the country; (ii) the vast majority of the populace are illiterate; (iii) the information media are ill-developed; (iv) in developing countries with colonial past development of political parties is much less than that of their respective bureaucracies; (v) some good provisions for control such as government servants' conduct rules, hierarchy, efficiency and disciplinary rules, field inspection, auditing, judicial powers to the courts to control administrative decisions affecting people's rights. In fact it is a common belief among older generation that more justice was administered during the British rule than during Pakistan day or in Bangladesh. There are good reasons for such belief. The British officers were not involved in the internal politics of the country. As such they could take a rational view in any matter. They were also aware of their alien surrounding. Such awareness prompted them to be more responsible. An administrative reform commission is working on preparing recommendations for a bureaucratic structure appropriate for a democratic Bangladesh. At the moment strict compliance of existing rules operationalising the constitutional provisions for setting up of the office of Ombudsman and strengthening of administrative tribunal are necessary. Judicial control is dependent on development of more democratic institutions such as free press, stronger bar associations, free universities etc. Development of such institutions takes time; but without conscious and concerted effort we may not see such institutions even in the distant future.

The 29-year-old, who fought her way back following an absence of over two years after being stabbed in the back by a fanatical Steffi Graf fan in Germany ten years ago, slumped 6-4, 6-0 in just under an hour to hard-hitting Russian Nadia Petrova on Tuesday. It was the second time in two weeks that the American veteran went down to 76th-ranked Petrova after retiring in Rome two weeks ago with a left foot injury which she admits has become unbearable. After one battle to return to the court, surgery is something Seles is loath to consider at this stage in her career. \"Realistically I know I'm in the later stages of my career. I don't have the luxury of taking five or six months off,\" she said. \"At the same time I don't want to have the surgery to put a screw in my foot, I am trying everything. \"I mean you think five months off, surgery, that's another three months of training. \"Lyndsay (Davenport) has done it. She's two years younger than I am. It could be done but I just don't think I would have that uphill challenge in me to do it. \"This year really since January has been very difficult. It's been a struggle. I think I do have to give it a break and then reassess what I want to do after how my foot responds to it. It's one of these things, it's your bone there's not much you can do just got to give it time.\" Seles, one of only two women ever to win a hattrick of titles here between 1990-1992 before being attacked, has never done worse than a quarterfinal finish in her ten previous appearances at Roland Garros.

Yugoslav-born Seles has collected 53 WTA titles and nine Grand Slams in her 14-year career, but only one Major crown since returning from her stabbing ordeal eight years ago - the 1996 Australian Open. But she ruled out making a rash decision on her future. \"I'm a positive person. I'll try not to give up. I mean, I've faced worse stuff. \"This is not the way I would like to leave.

The statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency argued that the real \"warmongering\" was coming from the United States and its \"puppets\" in Seoul. \"They would be well advised to keep in mind that the armistice agreement is no longer valid and (North Korea) is not restrained by the North-South declaration on non-aggression,\" a ministry spokesman said. The North announced last week that it would nullify the 1953 armistice and peace pacts signed with Seoul in protest over joint South Korea-US military manoeuvres that began on Monday. Because the Korean War was concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas have always remained technically at war.

He comes from the troubled southwestern province of Baluchistan. \"We have picked Mir Hazar Khan Khoso after frankly and openly discussing all the four names forwarded to us,\" chief election commissioner Fakhruddin Ibrahim told reporters in Islamabad. After his selection, Khoso, a retired judge, said that elections would be conducted according to the announced schedule and that fair and free elections were his topmost priority. “I will try my best to come up to the expectations of people,” he told the media in a press conference as reported by Pakistan daily newspaper Dawn. He further said that the cabinet would be sized as per needs. Khoso added that he would maintain relations with all political parties equally and would soon meet political leaders in person. Prime Minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani congratulated Khoso on his selection. Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) also accepted the selection of the new caretaker Prime Minister, even though Khoso's candidature was presented by the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). The outgoing government had proposed Khoso and a former central bank governor, while the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League-N, frontrunner to win the May 11 polls, put forward the name of another retired judge and a politician. Khoso was selected a week after parliament dissolved and four days after President Asif Ali Zardari set the date of the general election. The vote is set to mark the first time that an elected civilian government hands over to another in a country that has seen three military coups and four military rulers since partition from India in 1947.

{"title": "Interview with Asma Jahangir", "body": "Internationally renowned Pakistani human rights activist and lawyer Asma Jahangir talks to Hasan Zahid Tusher, Senior Reporter, The Daily Star, after receiving Friends of Liberation War Honour conferred upon her late father by the Bangladesh government, at a function on March 24 , 2013. Her father, Malik Ghulam Jilani, was arrested and imprisoned for denouncing Pakistan military's atrocities and genocide in Bangladesh in 1971. What are your feelings after receiving the award on behalf of your father? How do you see our government's initiative of honouring our foreign friends? I felt very emotional. I wish he had been here…it's not just the award, rather a feeling of being together. I think it's very magnanimous and a very positive idea. Can you recall your memories of 1971? My father was treated as a traitor and we were treated as children of a traitor. Now I take pride in the fact that being a traitor means to stand up for a good cause and for the right cause. My father was arrested. I feel very proud that he went to jail because he did the right thing. Will you face any difficulty in your country? I don't care at all. I don't care about the opinion of people who are bigoted. I live my life with freedom, integrity and honesty and not according to people who believe in atrocities and hate. Isn't it time for Pakistan to say mea culpa for the atrocities of 1971? I think the Pakistan government is afraid of our military. Otherwise politicians have a way of addressing the matter. I can apologise to you today and repeat the same act tomorrow. What is really important is to ensure that something like this [genocide and atrocities of 1971] does not happen again. Do you have any message for the people of Bangladesh? I hope that we can put the past behind us, learn lesson from it and go forward together for a prosperous South Asia. How do you see the next parliamentary election in Pakistan? I hope it will take place. There will be a lot of violence during election, as people get emotionally very heated up. Elections, unfortunately, do bring tensions as well. Whatever, this is a very positive step for Pakistan that it is heading toward election. I would hope this election will be more free and fair than the last because we have a very well respected chief election commissioner. Nevertheless, the election commission has been cleaned up in the last five years. So we hope that it will be better than the previous election. How do you see the caretaker government (CTG) formed for the first time in Pakistan? There is a debate whether there should be a CTG or not. Because the process of selection of the CTG has not been done in a happy mood, it has created a lot of disillusionment. The government will have no legitimacy to speak for the people as they do not represent the people. So, how much can they do, what will be their parameter of workall -- these things are up in the air. How will the PPP and Muslim League (Newaz) (MLN) fare in the election? My hunches are that the PPP will lose slightly from its previous position and MLN will do a little better. Because there will be more voters' turnout in the election, it will go in favour of Imran Khan. But I don't think it will be a three-way fight. It'll be a two-way contest. What is the future of Imran Khan? Will he be a major factor? Imran Khan could get enough seats to create a deadlock. I don't think he would form the next government but he will get enough seats to play a kingmaker role. His agenda is only to take advantage of the bad governance of both the political parties; he does not have a positive agenda himself. What about Pervez Musharraf? He has returned home, that's fine. He will make a few waves. But I don't think he has support in the country. His party is in disarray. People have not forgotten the 10 years of Pervez Musharraf which was disastrous for Baluchistan for example. Secondly, all the policies that he put in place are beginning to show the signs now. Those policies did not help the country either politically or economically. What will Pakistan get through the elections? Do you foresee any dangers for Pakistan? Through this election we would cement further the democratic transition. I believe that there are many hard decisions that the government has to take, and so far Pakistan politicians have not been able to take it because there is still heavy influence of the establishment [Military]. For example, the relationship with Bangladesh can be usually advanced and improved if there is a change in the foreign policy. But it is kept hostage by the military dictatorship even now. That is why we are hurting ourselves. If we don't have a policy of openness in the region we will be losing out both economically and socially. What will be the military's role during election? They don't have any constitutional role during the election apart from law and order. But they will do the maneuvering during election, and after the election they will have a major role as they have always had in putting the coalition together, in taking 13 Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) seats and most of the independent seats, under their wing. So they will have substantial amount of seats, which will be given as a gift to whoever listens to them. Until now they haven't abdicated their role as the kingmaker. It's not easy to take power away from the military. Either they play from behind the scene or they come in the front. You were nominated to the post of chief of CTG by MLN supported by PPP. Why did you not accept it? It was in the very early stages that MLN proposed my name and the PPP had no objection. But it was not done formally. Secondly, it's too much of a challenge to take on a caretaker responsibility when Imran Khan's party had certain reservation. I think given that situation it would not have been fair to accept any position. There are several crises, first of all the spate of violence that goes on everyday. It would be very difficult for the CTG to order operation or mass scale arrest. Secondly, there are some no go areas in Pakistan. How to tackle those? Thirdly, we want very much that the nationalists in Baluchistan should take part in the election. Some of them have refused to do so, and they are the ones who are more militant. They have threatened to prevent the elections from going ahead, and that needs to be tackled also. Then we have an economic crisis on our hands. Burning of Christian homes and terrorist attacks are happening almost on a weekly basis, and these need to be addressed by those who have confidence in the people. What are your views on fundamentalism in Pakistan? Militancy is a very serious problem for Pakistan, and not only that, bigotry is also a big problem for us. It has hampered our growth. It spreads fear and intimidation in the society. It has cut us away from the rest of the civilised world. I think that we have enormous challenges as Pakistan has become an epicenter of Islamic militancy. There are parts in the country where the army cannot go. How did fundamentalism find roots in Pakistan in the first place? How deep is it? It has deep roots. It had been openly and energetically supported by Gen. Zia's government in Pakistan and then sustained by state patronisation thereafter. It finds itself in a position to get rid of everything. They have impunity. They have protection from the state in many cases and they have been able to reorganise themselves and build wider network. How have you combated fundamentalism so far? More and more people are now debating that this is destroying our society. Public opinion has changed from support to the Taliban to resentment against them. Obviously, people cannot give them moral support. The army and the police are fighting the militants when they attack them. Besides, there are also talks with the militants. What roles are the civil society, media and the political parties playing in this? The political parties are now beginning to think that they have to take a collective position. But they are afraid. The civil society naturally wants no impunity for the militants. But at the same time, people who belong to the human rights group feel that even militants should have their due rights and due process, and that people cannot simply be accused of militancy and treated outside of the law or tortured or made to disappear. The media has been divided on the issue. There is a section of the media that justifies militancy on the grounds that there are drone attacks. There is another section of the media that fully denounces all kinds of militancy. They are constantly addressing the issue of religious intolerance. What part are the military and the intelligence agencies playing in this effort? What I read from newspapers in Pakistan is that there is some nexus, and they have a policy of \"The Good Talibans and the Bad Talibans.\" The ones that attack the military, they will obviously have nothing to do with them and attack them back. But the ones that do not attack our military, they are quite tolerant towards them...but we are not sure whether it is being done as part of the military policy or some elements in the intelligence agencies are doing it on their own. Is there any lesson for Bangladesh as regards to tackling fundamentalism? There can be polarisation, there can be differences and there should be criticism, but the political leadership should forge consensus on some important issues like this one. There has to be consensus on the issue that in the name of religion you cannot kill people. And secondly, there must be an end to the culture of impunity against those who kill and plunder, hurt and threaten other people in the name of religion. The third is that the military should stay away from politics. And that's the biggest lesson that Bangladesh can learn from Pakistan. How do you see the use of religion in politics in Pakistan and Bangladesh? There are Muslims but I don't think that the state has to tell them to become Muslims. Everyone should decide for himself or herself and he or she is accountable to the Almighty Allah rather than to the corrupt politicians, or corrupt religious leaderships, whether he or she is a good Muslim or bad Muslim. I think in that way, they dilute and divide politics and make politics hostage to religiosity, which is not healthy for any society. When there is nothing to offer to the people, they exploit religion. How can this be tackled? This issue has to be addressed with patience and more candidly, rather than in a hypocritical manner. Banning religious organisations or political parties will be counterproductive. Dialogue must start in Bangladesh between the various groups. How do you see events developing in Afghanistan after the US forces have withdrawn? I don't think there will be a complete withdrawal. There will be some troops still stationed in Afghanistan who will be operating there. Naturally, there will be violence and it will escalate and every player will start to play its part. But it would be very difficult for Afghanistan to revert to the days of the Taliban rule. How would it impact Pakistan? It [withdrawal] would have a huge impact on Pakistan. Because the refugees will start to come over, our back will be broken economically and there will be more attacks within Pakistan from Afghanistan and North Waziristan. Now the Talibans and Pakistani Talibans have bigger network and links. We will be have problems if we don't watch out. How do you see Iran? What is Pakistan's position on Iran? Our government has signed a MoU with Iran on the gas pipeline despite reservation from the US. We should do whatever is in the interest of Pakistan. We cannot exist on the interest of the US. Iran does not have any democracy in the real sense, and people are much suppressed there. We know that there are a number of political prisoners there. We know how women are treated there, there is no freedom of speech, and their electoral processes are by law flawed. As a human rights activist I won't say that the Iranian government is a great government. On the contrary, Iran is our neighbour and we want to see the Iranian people prosper and live a free life. We would not like any external forces to threaten them either physically or otherwise. How do you see Pakistan-US relations? When someone says it's a bad marriage I agree. We can't leave them, we can't live with them. There is a very shrill voice against the US. The right wing is against the US. But the human rights people are also very much against the US as it is the one that introduced anti-human rights practices like disappearances after 9/11. But we have to accept the fact that it is the lone superpower in the world. As a country we have to deal with them, we can't just wish them away.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/interview-with-asma-jahangir", "date": "2013-03-30T00:00:49+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 2259},

Abdur Rahman alias Rama, a servant in Bangabandhu's house, said he witnessed the killing of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975. Making his deposition before Judge Kazi Golam Rasul, the second witness, Rama, who was 14/15 years old at that time, told the court that he witnessed the killing of Bangabandhu. He said before killing Bangabandhu, a group of armymen first surrounded him in front of his bedroom when the President asked the army personnel, \"What do you want? Where do you want to take me?\"He (Mujib) was then dragged towards the stairs when another group of soldiers from the lower and of the staircase shot at him, said a weeping Rama, who also hails from Tungipara. Narrating the story of the fateful night of August 15, the witness said he and another servant, Selim, used to sleep on the corridor in front of Bangabandhu's bedroom and both were sleeping there that night. He went on saying, \"Suddenly early in the morning, at about 4:30 am, Begum Mujib came out of her room and awoke and informed me about the attack on Serniabat's house.\"Rama said then he went down and walked up to the lakeside outside the house when he saw a group of armymen advancing towards the house opening fire. \"As I came inside the house, I found Bangabandhu talking over phone from the reception,\" he said, adding \"I went upstairs through the backside staircase and found Begum Mujib moving anxiously on the corridor.\"Rama then went to the second floor of house and awoke Sheikh Kamal and his wife and ran down to the first floor and awoke Sheikh Jamal and his wife and informed them about the attack. Bangabandhu's eldest son, Sheikh Kamal, wearing a pant and shirt went down, Rama said. Afterwards, \"I heard sound of firing and groaning of 'Kamal Bhai.\"He said Bangabandhu went upstairs into his room and closed the door when he (Rama) took shelter in an adjacent room and also closed the door. Tremendous firing was going on outside the house at that time, he added. As Bangabandhu came out of his room, Rama told the court, he also came out and saw a group of armymen surrounding Bangabandhu standing near the bedroom. As the armymen surrounding him and dragged him towards the stairs, another group fired on him. Bangabandhu fell dead on the stairs. After killing Bangabandhu, an army person enquired me about my identity and asked me to go inside. I then ran to Bangabandhu's room and went into the bathroom where I found Begum Mujib along with Sheikh Jamal, Sultana Kamal, Rosy Jamal, Sheikh Russel and injured Sheikh Naser.\"Begum Mujib tore her saree and gave a bandage to Sheikh Naser, added the house servant. \"Amma, they (army) shot saheb,\" Rama told Begum Mujib. Soon after the army had come to the room and knocked the door, Begum Mujib said: \"I will open the door,\" Sheikh Jamal, who was standing beside his mother, said he would open the door. But Begum Mujib said: \"Let me open the door. If we die, we will die together.\"Then Begum Mujib opened the door and the armymen ''brought out Begum Mujib, me, Sheikh Russel and Sheikh Naser and dragged us downstairs'', said the witness. As Begum Mujib came out of the room and got struck seeing the body of Bangabandhu..... she shouted \"I will not go anywhere. Kill me here.\"The army personnel then dragged Begum Mujib towards the bedroom and soon sounds of firing and screams of women were heard, Rama said making his deposition on the fifth day of cross-examination in the trial of the stately murder case that began on July 6. He went on saying that then the armymen brought him, Russel and Sheikh Naser to a line outside the building. \"I saw there the body of policeman in plainclothes lying on the ground.\"One army person then asked Sheikh Naser about his identity and took him inside the building. \"I heard sound of firing and groaning of Sheikh Naser .... 'baba ... ma....\"A scared and weeping Russel went near AFM Muhitul Islam, plaintiff of the case, and asked: \"Will they also kill me?\" Muhitul Islam told him: \"No brother, they will not kill you.\"Rama, who said he witnessed the whole episode of the tragedy of President Mujib and his family members, further said. As the weeping Russel wanted to go to his mother, one army person got hold of him (Russel) and said: \"Come on. I will take you to your mother.\"\"But, soon after the army person had taken Russel inside the house, I heard the sound of firing and groaning,\" said Rama. In his deposition, he said some army persons wearing in black were seen looting valuables from Bangabandhu's house. After some time, Rama told the court, a tank came rolling near the gate of the house and some armymen coming out of the tank asked the soldiers at the gate: \"What is the situation.\"Replied one (army person) standing near the gate: \"All finished.\"Rama said he was released by the army from the house at around 12 noon and asked to go away. \"Out of fear of life I straight went to my village home at Gopalganj,\" said Bangabandhu's servant, after 22 years of the killing, completing his deposition. Rama is now working as peon at Livestock Directorate in Gopalganj. However, after submission of deposition by Abdur Rahman alias Rama, defence counsels began cross-examination of the witness. Anwar Jahid Bhuiyan, counsel for accused Capt (Retd) Abdul Wahab Joardar, began the cross-examination in absence of his senior, Abdur Razzak Khan.

At opening bell of the week, the market was extremely depre-ssed and fell around 200 points in a single day which was a 13-month low, it said. The market enjoyed a sharp recovery on Monday, on the news of government's approval of Bank Company Act, said the stockbroker. However, the market could not sustain the upward trend due to investors' shaky sentiments towards the political uncertainty, it said. \"The week ended amid conspicuous volatility over political worries.

{"title": "Down in downpour", "body": "Life in the capital and elsewhere in the country was in an utter shambles yesterday due to incessant rain for the last four days. Thirteen more deaths in rain-induced incidents were reported in Cox's Bazar yesterday, raising the toll to 21 in the coastal district in the past couple of days. Two others were killed in Bandarban on Thursday. Flash floods inundated more areas, leaving several thousand people marooned in Narayanganj and Chandpur. In the capital, waterlogging and traffic chaos caused untold miseries to city dwellers. The met department forecast that rain was likely to continue today raises fears of a worse situation on the first weekday. Almost all the roads, alleys and thoroughfares in Dhaka remained under rainwater for most of yesterday, largely due to inadequate and dysfunctional storm sewer system. Filth and human waste coming out of the sewers added to the sufferings of the city people. \"My daughter and I got smeared with filths on our way back home from her school,\" said Afroza Shipon of Mohakhali area. \"Is there any authority at all to take care of waterlogging?\" she said in exasperation. Hosne Ara Begum of Shantinagar area was frustrated over the city corporation authorities' failure to address waterlogging, though recurrent and persistent in her area. \"With any amount of rain, the roads in the area get inundated. Traffic movement collapses and the residents suffer a lot,\" she said. A similar situation was seen in Mirpur, Kalyanpur, Shewrapara, Mohammadpur, Shahjahanpur, Khilgaon, Demra, Badda, Kamalapur, Jatrabari and elsewhere in the capital. It usually takes around half an hour for Abdus Sobhan Tarafdar to commute from Keraniganj to his workplace in Farmgate. But yesterday, it took him over two hours. \"I had to change several routes to avoid traffic congestions … though it was weekend,\" he said. Tired of being stuck in traffic for around two hours, Sobhan left his car at Karwan Bazar and walked to his office. According to Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority officials, the existing storm drainage can deal with 20-millimetre rainfall at a time. If the rainfall exceeds this limit, it takes hours for water to recede. And between Friday morning and Saturday morning, the city experienced rainfall thrice its drainage system can sustain. During this time, 67mm rainfall was recorded in the capital and 263mm in Cox's Bazar, according to the met department. Light to moderate rain would continue across the country today due to an active monsoon and low over Bangladesh and adjoining areas, the met office forecast yesterday. However, the intensity of rainfall was likely to come down. Meanwhile in Cox's Bazar, unrelenting rain induced fresh mudslides in Teknaf upazila, claiming two lives yesterday. Bodies of 11 others, killed in flashed floods and other rain-triggered incidents, were recovered. Several lakh people living inside the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) embankment were marooned in one to four feet deep water, reports our Narayanganj correspondent.

In Chandpur, flash floods triggered by continuous rain have inundated a large number of houses, roads and croplands in low-lying areas, reports our correspondent there.

The military has sought to clarify a December 29 incident in which it states a US soldier was wounded when troops came under fire from a Pakistani border guard who they say was inside Afghan territory. A US warplane dropped a 500-pound bomb at an empty religious school where the assailant took shelter. The school lies on the Pakistani side of a Pakistani border post, which the US military says has been established 300 meters (yards) inside Afghanistan. The US claims the school is in Afghanistan. The Pakistani military said the bomb fell on Pakistani soil. \"That's as close as we actually came,\" Clutter said about crossing the border. When asked if US troops had crossed into Pakistan in the past, he said: \"The bottom line is, we haven't done it.\" In a statement sent to AFP Thursday, the US military said it \"may pursue attackers who attempt to escape into Pakistan to evade capture or retaliation.\" Islamabad has bristled at the claims, with domestic feeling there growing that Washington was treating its key coalition ally with contempt. Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat and Information Minister Sheikh Rashid rejected the US statement. Rashid said Pakistan was \"perfectly capable\" of securing its borders. Clutter strove to downplay the border clash and resultant anger in Pakistan, expressed in a series of anti-American protests Friday led by Islamist leaders. \"It was a very minor thing,\" he said of the clash. \"Pakistan is a very strong ally, it's been a very stable partner in the war on terrorism.\" Reports of the incident have outraged Pakistan's Islamist-ruled North West Frontier Province, where anti-US feeling has run high during the 14-month-old military campaign against al-Qaeda and Taliban.

He added that in this case Ocalan's file would be sent to parliament, which has to ratify the sentence before his execution can proceed. The decision came at the end of a seven-hour meeting between Ecevit and his two coalition partners. The Strasbourg-based court asked Turkey in November to suspend Ocalan's execution until it rules on his complaints against Ankara -- a process that could take up to two years. Ecevit, however, made it clear the suspension would not be valid \"under any circumstances\" during that period. \"We will not wait for the completion of this process if the suspension is exploited in a way that can damage Turkey,\" he stressed. \"Turkey's own interest are above anything.\" The partial response to the Strasbourg court appeared aimed at the coalition's second biggest partner, the far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP), whose members had called for for Ocalan's execution. The MHP, led by Devlet Bahceli, came in second in polls last April after campaigning on a \"hang-Ocalan\" platform, and has since come under pressure from its electorate to push for his execution. Bahceli declined to comment on the government's decision. Ecevit's Democratic Left Party (DSP) opposes capital punishment, while the coalition's third partner, the center-right Motherland Party (ANAP) of Mesut Yilmaz also favored suspending the sentence. Turkey, a declared candidate for European Union membership, is under pressure to meet EU human rights standards, which forbid capital punishment.

{"title": "A Rare Example", "body": "We are pleasantly surprised by a news item published Sunday in an important Bangla daily of Dhaka. It tells a poignant but heartwarming story of a team of doctors at Suhrawardy hospital led by Dr Saeeda Akhtar. They saved the life of a critically ill patient on the night of Eid-ul-Fitr. The patient Suraiya Sultana was under the treatment of Dr Akhtar for about 6 weeks at the hospital with gynae problems. Her condition started deteriorating on the night of Eid. Her doctor was informed at about midnight. She organised her team, rushed to the hospital and decided to operate upon the critically ill patient defying the odd of staff shortage. The doctors themselves pushed the trolley, arranged for blood transfusion and crossmatching and procured life saving drugs and medicines. By their timely intervention a valuable life was saved. In any civilised country this act of goodness would be termed as normal or routine duty of doctors. But the scenario in Bangladesh is different. Here, even on normal weekends it is difficult to get doctors to attend to critically ill patients in times of emergency.

{"title": "Please, Strengthen EC", "body": "IF the question is whether the Election Commission has failed to ensure peaceful, free and fair voting at the recently-held by-elections and the Chittagong City Corporations polls, the answer would definitely be yes. Regardless of what the government wants to have us believe, these polls were marred by bloody violence and wide-spread allegations of manipulations, in some cases purportedly engineered by bureaucrats and politicians alike. Besides, the opposition boycott did put their credibility and acceptability on the line. However, if the question is whether the commission has been biased and partial in the conduct of the elections, the answer would have to be in the negative regardless of what the opposition parties would like to have us believe. Besides, despite sustained hue and cry over the Chief Election Commissioner's resignation, the opposition has so far not been able to produce any substantive evidence in this regard, either. It is nonetheless beyond doubt that the EC has not been able to live up to either its responsibilities or to the popular expectations as regards conducting the electoral process. The failure, however, has more to do with personnel and logistic inadequacy rather than lack of commitment and sincerity. Unfortunately, the government has so far been largely apathetic in this behalf. That the present regime is yet to approve EC proposals for upgrading district election officers (DEOs) and thereby paving the path for appointment of thana election officers (TEOs) bears a strong testimony to that. The government's indifference and thereby inertia can have disquieting implications. It could be ascribed to an immature perception, on its part, of democracy at best and deliberate ploy to gain political advantage of a feeble EC at worst. Besides, many feel that the bureaucrats have knowingly prolonged the process, for strengthened EC might encroach upon their 'dominion' at the field level. In the short term, an inadequate EC may, in a crooked way, serve whoever is in power; but in the long run, such an arrangement is bound to frustrate the electorate, and eventually make them apathetic to the electoral process itself. Elections, and thereby governance, would be detached from people, essentially meaning death to democracy. Primarily, therefore, our plea to the government is for an immediate action to strengthen the EC by okaying the proposed recruitment proposal. In this regard, we cannot help advise the opposition to rally around this issue instead of demanding the CEC's scalp.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/please-strengthen-ec", "date": "2000-01-18T00:00:24+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 400},

{"title": "President Zillur passes away", "body": "Zillur Rahman. (March 9, 1929--March 20, 2013) Star file photo. President Zillur Rahman's passing makes him only the third head of state, the others being Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and General Ziaur Rahman, to have died in office. The difference, however, is that Bangabandhu's death was sudden and hugely tragic, given that it came through a bloody coup d'etat; and Zia's murder came about through an abortive coup. The life that the political giant lived ended yesterday at the age of 84 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, where he had been undergoing treatment for respiratory problems and other complications since March 11. As the news spread, condolences poured in on the social media, and the government declared a three-day national mourning beginning today. The president's body is to be flown home on a special Bangladesh Biman flight today. He will be laid to the eternal rest by his wife at the Banani graveyard at 5:00pm tomorrow. His first namaz-e-janaza would be held at the Jatiya Eidgah Maidan at 2:30pm and the second janaza at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban at 3:30pm tomorrow, reports BSS. Zillur Rahman may be considered to have lived a political life to the full, an experience that truly was set off in his youth. Born on 9 March 1929 in Bhairab, Kishoreganj, he was destined, like so many others of his generation, to be drawn to the widening whirlpool of Bangalee nationalist politics through the Language Movement of 1952. As one among the eleven Dhaka University students instrumental in the decision to break Section 144 on 21 February, Zillur Rahman made it known where his future would lead him. Politics was what began to matter to him, as his activism in favour of the Jukta Front in the election campaign of 1954 was to demonstrate so amply. It was Zillur Rahman's association with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, set in motion in 1946 when both men were students and when the future founder of Bangladesh was actively involved in the referendum for Sylhet to be made part of Pakistan, that was to deepen in the years when the Bangalee nationalist movement gathered pace in East Pakistan. Zillur Rahman, in the manner of scores of others of his generation, burnished his political credentials through his participation in the struggle against the military dictatorship of Ayub Khan in 1962 and in the movement for the Awami League's Six Point programme in 1966. His engagement with the mass upsurge of 1969 was impressive enough for him to be elected to the Pakistan national assembly at the general elections of December 1970. As part of the political leadership which organised the War of Liberation in 1971, he found himself on a new and higher perch the following year when the ruling Awami League, led by Bangabandhu as president, elected him its general secretary. It was a position which he would occupy again, years later, under Bangabandhu's daughter Sheikh Hasina. This photo of October 3, 2004 shows Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina covers her face with a handkerchief standing beside a sobbing Zillur Rahman, who was still mourning the death of his wife, veteran Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, in a grenade attack on August 21 the same year. FILE PHOTO For the brief period in which the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) operated in 1975, he served as one of the four general secretaries of the party. Zillur Rahman's was always the spirit of a determined fighter for democracy. Four years in prison during the military rule of General Ziaur Rahman, following the murder and mayhem of August-November 1975, only served to harden his resolve to have Bangladesh return to democracy, a resolve which only reasserted itself in the nearly decade-long struggle against the Ershad autocracy in the 1980s. As a career politician, he was eminently equipped to be part of a process which consistently emphasised the primacy of democratic order in the country. He was a parliamentarian who since his entry into national politics was hardly ever out of parliament. He served as a minister when the Awami League returned to power for the first time in more than two decades in 1996. In simple terms, there was the seasoned politician in him. His career was given more substance when he married Ivy Rahman, a dedicated Bangalee nationalist, and together the couple went on to carve a special niche for themselves in Awami League politics. It was a deep relationship that was to go through supreme tragedy when Ivy Rahman fell victim to the grenade attack on an Awami League rally in Dhaka on 21 August 2004. His wife's death certainly led to a vacuum in his life. But Zillur Rahman, the quintessential politician, was not willing to have the tragedy undermine his faith in himself and in his country. Proof of such courage and fortitude came through his careful, determined steering of the Awami League at a time when, with Sheikh Hasina in incarceration following the imposition of a state of emergency in January 2007, the party was under pressure from within and without. It was the veteran politician Zillur Rahman who was elected the 19th president of Bangladesh in January 2009 in succession to the rather discredited Iajuddin Ahmed. The new president, in terms of constitutional procedure, was seen to be fulfilling all the responsibilities the office enjoined upon him. Even so, it was disturbing for the nation to be witness to as many as twenty one presidential pardons granted to various classes of individuals on Zillur Rahman's watch. It was certainly not Zillur Rahman's finest hour, for the figures were in sharp contrast to the mere four pardons granted by presidential fiat between 1972 and 2008. Zillur Rahman's death removes from the scene a president whose entire career had been made and moulded in politics. At a time when a widening political chasm defines ties between the major political parties, especially with general elections only months away, it will be the responsibility of the individual who succeeds Zillur Rahman to reassure the country that the presidency is one institution which means to be inclusive for all citizens, which the nation can turn to in its search for a way out of the woods.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/president-zillur-passes-away", "date": "2013-03-21T00:15:21+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1040},

The news outlet said the reporter used a hidden camera to record dozens of conversations with bank employees, which it then posted on its website. \"We suspended 20 employees who were shown in the CobraPost video, it was one of the first steps we took when the video came to light,\" said the source at HDFC (Housing Development Finance Corporation). The employees worked at various bank branches across north, west and east India, the source added.

ICICI, India's second-largest bank by assets, said it has suspended 18 employees over the issue. Axis has launched an internal inquiry into the accusations, local media reported.

{"title": "Vaughan leads Eng way", "body": "Michael Vaughan took over as the Ashes series leading run-scorer to put England well on the road to beating Australia for the first time this summer in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. Vaughan followed up his masterpiece centuries in Adelaide and Melbourne with an unbeaten 113 as the tourists revelled in the unfamiliar position of turning the screws on Steve Waugh's team, bidding for only the second 5-0 Ashes clean sweep in history. The fluent Yorkshire opener turned up the heat on the Australians, who earlier in the day nudged past England's first innings 362 total by one run. At the close of the third day, Vaughan and skipper Nasser Hussain (34 not out) were having few problems at 218 for two -- a lead of 217 runs with eight wickets intact and two days to play. Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said his teammates sensed a challenge looming over the remaining two days. \"The team senses that it has a real fight on its hands, we haven't been in this position for maybe two or three years,\" Gilchrist said. \"In this type of scenario where it's mounting up to a really big challenge on the last day the guys realise it's going to take a lot of fight and determination to win.\" The highest winning score at the SCG is 276 for four set over a century ago which Australia scored to beat England by six wickets. Hussain's team were on course to get well past that historical high-water mark sometime early Sunday. Vaughan, out for a seven-ball duck in the first innings, took part-time bowler Damien Martyn off his pads for four for his eighth Test ton in his last 12 Tests. It came off 147 balls with 14 fours and a six. He had his only life on 102 when he was put down by Justin Langer at mid-wicket off Martyn. At the close, 28-year-old Vaughan had batted for four hours for his unfinished century off 182 balls with 16 boundaries and a six. Vaughan's opening partner Marcus Trecothick gave Brett Lee his 100th wicket in his 27th Test when he played on to his stumps when he was on 22 in the sixth over. Mark Butcher, the scorer of 124 in the first innings, was surprised by extra bounce from leg-spinner Stuart MacGill and dollied a catch to Hayden at short leg for 34 leaving England at 124 for two. Australia clawed their way to a bare lead after adding 126 for the last five wickets on Saturday to finish the series leading on the first innings in all of five Tests. The Australians got there on the back of centuries by Gilchrist (133) and captain Steve Waugh (102) and wiped out what would have been a testing deficit with the home side to bat last on the deteriorating pitch. Gilchrist pounded his seventh Test century and second Ashes hundred to frustrate England's efforts to mop up the Australian resistance. The dashing No.7 left-hander played one of his audacious knocks to bring up his 100 off 94 balls with 14 boundaries. He was out soon after the resumption, giving a faint edge to Alec Stewart off Steve Harmison. In a massive anti-climax for the expectant home fans who flooded into the ground, Waugh was out in the second over of the day without addition to his overnight score. The Australian skipper edged firmly chest-high to Mark Butcher at second slip off Matthew Hoggard. The 37-year-old Australian hero batted for 182 minutes, faced 135 balls and cracked 18 boundaries. He put on 91 runs for the sixth wicket with Gilchrist. Waugh's 29th Test century equalled cricket immortal Don Bradman's Australian record. Vice-captain Gilchrist assumed the responsibility to marshal the tailend to chip away at England's first innings. Jason Gillespie, who provided Gilchrist with stoic support for him to reach his century, remained 31 not out off 83 balls with two fours and a straight-hit six off spinner Richard Dawson. They put on 82 runs for the ninth wicket. Medium-pacer Hoggard, who had taken just one wicket in the series prior to the Sydney Test, finished with 4-92 off 21.3 overs and Andy Caddick and Steve Harmison captured three wickets each.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/vaughan-leads-eng-way", "date": "2003-01-05T00:00:19+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 707},
{"title": "How Internet impacts language?", "body": "SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 14: Have you been LOL lately? No? You must not be Internet savvy. But beware: The expression - which means \"laughing out loud\" - could creep into non-Net communication before long, reports AP. How the computer revolution is changing and evolving language was among the topics discussed at the recent annual meeting of the Modern Language Association. One researcher looked at the evolution of an early discussion list on the Arpanet, the predecessor of the Internet. The discussion list was much like the Internet news groups of today, with messages passed among members by computer. Susan C Herring of the University of Texas, Arlington, said she was surprised by many of her findings, mainly that computer correspondence did not lead to reduce sentence complexity, poor grammar or an abundance of typos. \"This should reassure parents who think their children's grammar will suffer because of the Internet,\" she said. And, contrary to popular belief, computer correspondence did not appear to lead to a homogenous style among users. Instead, writers tended to cultivate their own style, perhaps to compensate for the impersonal nature of computers. Herring also found that computer correspondence tended to become less formal, and in fact, less polite, than other communication. The study looked at the archived messages of about 100 computer science professionals in the discussion group from 1975 to 1986. The Internet provides an interesting laboratory for examining language changes, Herring said, noting how computer talk is crawling into general use. Take the \"smiley,\" the combination colon and end parenthesis that indicate a happy face in Net-speak. \"Smiley faces have been around for a long time, where they were right side up,\" she said. \"The Internet turned them sideways. Now I see more and more people putting them in letters and notes that way.\" Other researchers looked at the more subtle ways the World Wide Web impacted language. Lisa Gerrard of the University of California at Los Angeles examined nearly 200 Web sites created by women, with a primary audience of women. Overall, the sites challenged traditional stereotypes - or tried to tweak them. For example, she noted, references to \"chicks\" and \"bimbos\" were used in an empowering way. A search of the Web shows such women's sites as www.brazenhussy.com, www.chicklick.com and www.riotgrrl.com. Kenneth Rivers of Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, spoke on the use of French on the Internet - or the lack of it. There wasn't a French search engine on the World Wide Web until February 1996, Rivers said. Today, only 2 per cent of what is available on the Internet is in French. Most of what's on the Net is in English. Rivers said the lack of diverse languages on the Web posed the question: If a language isn't a part of the Internet, can it survive? \"The very fact that we're not positive on the matter is frightening in itself,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/how-internet-impacts-language", "date": "1999-01-15T00:00:28+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 483},
{"title": "Bacher on brighter side", "body": "Even if England and Australia bow to political pressure to boycott cricket World Cup matches in Zimbabwe, next month's tournament will be the biggest and best ever, organiser Ali Bacher said today. The leaders of Britain and Australia are pressing their respective cricket authorities to forfeit matches in Zimbabwe to protest President Robert Mugabe's policies, blamed by his critics for a deepening crisis and hunger in the southern African country. \"It would be unfortunate obviously, but the World Cup will take place,\" Bacher said in an interview. \"It remains the biggest World Cup ever played, the biggest sporting event this country has seen. And we remain confident that it will be a success story for South Africa and international cricket. \"February 8 in Cape Town will be an opening ceremony of Olympic proportions... It will set the tone for a successful World Cup.\" South Africa is hosting the tournament -- the biggest world cup ever with 14 teams competing -- with six of the 54 matches scheduled for Zimbabwe. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has heaped pressure on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to boycott Zimbabwe, but British government officials failed to reach any agreement at a meeting on Thursday, leaving the decision with the ECB. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has ruled that any team refusing to play in Zimbabwe would forfeit the match, effectively handing a victory tot he Zimbabwe team, which otherwise has little hope of qualifying from the toughest group. Blair says he can not force the ECB to boycott, and his government has rejected suggestions of compensating the ECB if they cancel. The England team would face a one million pound fine (1.6-million-dollar) and forfeit two World Cup points if they boycott the match. Bacher, a former head of South African cricket who is serving as executive director of this year's tournament, says cricketing authorities should not be forced to make political decisions. \"In my opinion it is unreasonable and unfair to ask a sporting body, a cricket body, to make a significant political decision of this magnitude. This responsibility should lie with government,\" he said. \"It would be inappropriate for me publicly to advise those two cricket bodies how to respond. \"My information is that there will be significant pressure on the English cricket board not to play in Zimbabwe.\" Critics accuse Mugabe of bringing the former British colony to its knees through his seizures of white-owned farm land, which they say has exacerbated food shortages. Some western governments say he rigged his re-election in March after a campaign marred by violence. The row has split the Common-wealth on roughly racial lines, with New Zealand coming out in support of British and Australian boycott calls, even though they themselves are not scheduled to play in Zimbabwe. South Africa and a number of other countries have favoured a less confrontational approach to Mugabe. India, Pakistan, Namibia and the Netherlands are the other four teams scheduled to play in Zimbabwe. \"Within South Africa, generally speaking, there is a viewpoint that the political direction in Zimbabwe must change, the political direction ... and it must change for social, moral, economic and human rights reasons,\" Bacher said. \"How is that objective achieved? There are two avenues -- the one is by dialogue and constructive engagement, and that is the viewpoint of the South African government. The other avenue is of sanctions and boycotts, which has been expressed by a couple of governments,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bacher-on-brighter-side", "date": "2003-01-11T00:00:43+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 578},

Bangladesh team, arriving in this tidy tourist resort on January 17, had a two-hour practice session in the morning today at a venue where they would also play their second group league match against Kenya on January 21. \"This is a flat wicket and there is no grass on the pitch which means it will help the batsman,\" said coach Dipu Roy Chowdhury in the afternoon. \"We will bat first if we win the toss. Although I have not seen Namibia playing in the meet, but I have heard that their batting is good,\" Dipu said. Replying to a query, the bearded Bangladesh coach said that Kalim might play in place of Arman Hossain Sohagh. Weather permitting the match will start at 10 am.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh-face-namibia-today", "date": "2000-01-19T00:00:45+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 234},

The Ansars deployed there to guard the mills were reportedly dozing, keeping the rifles on the floor and the door of the security room open. But the FIR at the Abhoynagar thana states that an organised group of 15 masked young men stormed into the security room firing shots at the Ansars at about 3-30 am. They confined the Ansars in another room at gun point and looted the rifles and bullets and then escaped raising slogans in favour of an outlawed organisation. They also exploded hand bombs and fired several blank shots. Ansar Bishnupada Saha was injured as the miscreants fired shots while entering into the security room of the jute mills, the second biggest in the Jessore industrial belt, the FIR said.

{"title": "Hosts take on India in opener today", "body": "Cricket lovers in the country will wake up to a week-long cricket carnival today when hosts Bangladesh take on giants India in the opening tie of the Coca-Cola Independence Cup tournament at the Dhaka Stadium. But a blanket of thick fog which has been prevailing over the country for the last few days threatens to disrupt a smooth progress of the tri-nation tourney that also includes Pakistan. According to a Met Office forecast, the foggy weather is likely to prevail. If the condition does not improve today, the match is likely to have a delayed start. But Mike Denness, the match referee and former England captain, is still hopeful of a full 50-over-a-side affair. Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad will formally inaugurate the tournament and the match is scheduled to start at 9 am. Both the state-run electronic media - Bangladesh Television and Betar - will provide the ball-by-ball commentary of the match from the big bowl. The stage is all set to take the heat of the big time cricket. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), organisers of the tourney to celebrate the country's Silver Jubilee of Independence, has completed all the necessary preparations to make the gala event a success. However, Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan and his Indian counterpart Mohammad Azharuddin opted to wait till the morning before finalising the playing eleven. But an expected full-house crowd at the 35,000-capacity Dhaka Stadium will keep their finger crossed for a shiny day to enjoy the game of glorious uncertainties. The country is in the grip of cricket fever with the fans still having a busy time to collect a ticket of whatever match. Tickets of the six matches including the mandatory three finals are almost sold out. But touts are seen engaged in brisk selling of tickets around the stadium. This is for the fifth time Bangladesh will face India in an official limited-over match since their first meeting in October 1988. Bangladesh lost all their previous four engagements against their more colourful neighbours by an identical nine-wicket margin. \"This is for the first time we have included a bunch of new faces in our side and I hope they will perform up to their potential,\" said Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan in a crowded press briefing at a local hotel last night. Tournament coordinator Syed Ashraful Haque, match referee Mike Denness and all the captains and managers of the participating teams attended the briefing. \"The whole nation is expecting a good performance from us after two embarrassing tours of Kenya and New Zealand. As far as standard is concerned, there is a gulf of difference between them and us, but we will try our best to put up a good fight,\" said a soft-spoken Akram. When Akram was hoping for a better outcome, his Indian counterpart Mohammad Azharuddin, who regained the captaincy a week ago replacing Sachin Tendulkar, expressed his concern over the prevailing weather. \"The wicket looked a bit damp in the morning when we had our practice at the venue. I don't know how it is going to be tomorrow. I think, no one can make any prediction until the match starts,\" said Azhar. \"However, we have come here to play and we are taking every match seriously. Bangladesh is an emerging nation, but there is no scope of underestimating them,\" said the Hydrabad-born most successful Indian captain. At official briefing, Syed Ashraful Haque, a vice-president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, declined to disclose the financial dealings of the tournament. \" I am not authorised to say anything other than introducing the officials of the three teams,\" he said in reply to a volley of questions from the newsmen, who were eager to know the deal between the Board and America-based WorldTel. Ashraful, however, assured that the board would disclose all the details about the deal in a month. The WorldTel will provide live coverage of the tournament to 20 countries across the globe. Doug Cowie of New Zealand and Russell Tiffin of Zimbabwe will officiate today's match while Rudi Koertzen of South Africa will act as the third umpire.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/hosts-take-on-india-in-opener-today", "date": "1998-01-10T00:00:04+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 681},

Maradona was receiving treatment at the Cantegrill Clinic after \"suffering from a hypertension attack with ventricular arrhythmia, complicated by the fact he already had high blood pressure,\" said Dr Frank Torres. Maradona's manager Guill-ermo Coppola denied reports that his condition had been brought on by drug addiction or an overdose. \"Everyone knows that Mara-dona has hypertension,\" Coppo-la, who was acquitted last year of cocaine possession, told the Radio Mitre radio station. \"It's already happened to him more than once -- in Chile during a television programme and then when playing football in Buenos Aires, but there were no indications that drugs had anything to do with it,\" he added. \"There was no ambulance, there was no coma, there were no police,\" he said,\" blasting what he called sensational press reports of Maradona's ailment. Torres said the 39-year-old Maradona was admitted to the clinic's intensive care unit on Tuesday afternoon. Maradona, who all but singlehandedly won the 1986 World Cup for Argentina over Germany and then led them to the 1990 final where the Germans gained revenge, was accompanied to the hospital by his wife Claudia Villafane and Coppola with whom he had been on holiday. \"He is under observation and no complications are expected meaning he should only have a short stay in the clinic,\" Torres added. When asked if the problems were brought about by a drug overdose, Torres refused to confirm or deny, answering only: \"The hypertension problems could have many different causes.\" Maradona has had repeated drug problems and has had rehabilitation several times. He was even thrown out of the 1994 World Cup for failing a drugs test and had a drugs ban while playing for Napoli in Italy. He had been on holiday at the expensive holiday resort of Punte del Este where he spent the New Year. Maradona, who courted controversy throughout a tempestuous career with Boca Juniors, before European stardom with Barcelona and Napoli, was recently voted Argentine spor-tsman of the 20th century. He retired from football in 1997. Argentine President Fernando de la Rua said he hoped Maradona would make a speedy recovery. \"He has given so much happiness to everyone,\" he said. Among those to visit Maradona in the clinic were former president Carlos Menem and Uruguayan international Enzo Francescoli. \"I feel reassured because Diego is perfectly all right,\" Menem said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/maradona-hospitalised", "date": "2000-01-06T00:00:27+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 417},
{"title": "For An Enlightened Theatre in The New Millennium", "body": "LIKE every other morning, life of Kana and her husband Asheque begins in a peaceful manner at their apartment. Kana, daughter of a rich father, bears an extremely feminist ideology and is absolutely against any kind of dowry. One of the major reasons she loves and respects her husband very much is that her husband refused to take any sort of dowry from her father at the time of their marriage. Asheque, an established engineer, also loves his wife the same way and the couple was set for a perfect happy conjugal life until that morning. Their technician Ratan comes up with the news of suicide of Soroma, a neighbor who lives in another apartment of the same building. The news comes to Kana as a shock as it is gradually revealed that Soroma committed suicide under the irresistible pressure for dowry by her husband and in-laws. Things become more unbearable for her when Aheque goes forward to help Ronen, the husband of Soroma. But still Kana was ready to carry on unless she finds some of his father's letter written to her husband where to her greatest surprise, she discovers that Asheque have been regularly taking dowry from her father without her slightest knowledge. Kana thinks of Soroma and realizes the sheer helplessness that led Soroma to commit suicide but Kana resolves not to follow her. She faces her husband boldly, reveals everything and resolves to go forward, against the whole society. This is how the play 'Soroma' ends. The play was staged at the opening ceremony of the three-day long millennium drama festival by Nagarik Nattyangan on December 31 at the Guide House Auditorium. The play is written by Dipak Sen and directed by Lucky Enam. This is the thirtieth show of the play. Lucky Enam played the role of Kana and the roles of Asheque, Ronen and Ratan were played by Mahmudul Islam Selim, Nurul Hasnat Zilan and Imran Humayun Khan respectively. Gias Babu played the character of Ajay, the brother of Soroma. Mahmudul Islam Selim did a good job in the stage direction while costume designed by Tahmina Sharif Naz was suitable to the story. Nagarik Nattyangan is celebrating its fifth founding anniversary. The celebration began with a colourful rally at 3pm. The rally ended at the millennium tower built by the Nagarik Nattyangan at the Guide House premises. An Iftar party was thrown on the occasion. The inauguration ceremony took place at 6.30pm. Industry minister Tofael Ahmed was present as the chief guest. The president of Sammilito Sanskritik Jote Ramendu Majumder and general secretary of Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation Liakat Ali Lucky were present as special guests. Liakat Ali Lucky, in his speech, expressed deep gratitude to all the audience and persons related with Bangladesh theatre movement and he wished the best for Nagarik Nattyangan. Ramendu Majumder said, 'At the eve of this new millennium, it is high time that we can hope for a bright and luminous future for the theatre of our country.' Golam Haider, the general secretary of Nagarik Nattyangan, said that every drama of the group tries to send a message to its audience. Tofael Ahmed said that the group theatres of the country are working hard since our liberation, to uphold the glorious image of our country. The presider of the discussion meeting, Enamul Huq, expressed his firm resolution to carry on with the Nagarik Nattyangan and hoped to be pledge-bound under the common resolution to work for the development of the theatre movement of Bangladesh in the new millennium. The play 'Soroma' was staged after the inauguration and later a seminar on drama and a cultural programme took place, which continued till midnight with all the members of Nagarik Nattyangan welcoming the new millennium. Nagarik Nattyangan was founded on January 1, 1995 and since then the group has concentrated on production of drama close to life. With its first production 'Kholosh', an adaptation by Lucky Enam from the original of J.B.Priestly and directed by Enamul Huq, Nagarik Nattyangan entered the theatre arena on April 29, 1995. The second show of the play 'Grihabasi', the tenth and last production of the group was staged yesterday on the occasion of its founding anniversary. The play is written by Enamul Huq and directed by Lucky Enam. Nagarik Nattyangan has performed in Assam and Tripura.

Jatiya Sramik League organised the function at the historic Paltan maidan to accord reception to Food Minister Amir Hossain Amu, Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil and Health and Family Welfare Minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. The foreign minister said Begum Zia has made an unholy alliance with the anti-liberation and autocratic forces to destabilise peace in the country aimed at grabbing power by any means. \"There is no alternative to coming to power without election. So you have to come to power by taking people's mandate,\" he said adding that people is the only force who would choose a party to rule the country by casting their vote in the next general election. Referring to the comments of Khaleda Zia in the businessmen's conference, he said the announcement of Khaleda Zia, that if necessary BNP would call hartal everyday, it was like a declaration of war against the nation and humanity. Azad also said that Begum Zia has not shown interest to sit for dialogue with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina despite repeated attempts in this regard. \"The BNP chief, who is surrounded by anti-liberation and autocratic forces, does not want to settle the issues through talks. On the other hand she wants to fish in the troubled waters,\" he added. The minister said the ill motives of Khaleda to destabilise peace by ignoring the Prime Minister's invitation for talks has been clear to the people of the country. Food Minister Amir Hossain Amu urged the members of Sramik League and other progressive people to build a strong resistance unitedly against the alliance of opposition political party. \"The autocrats, Razakars and vote thieves have been united against the democratic, progressive and non-communal forces in the country,\" he said adding that it was the proper time to give a befitting reply to the anti-people alliance.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/fm-urges-bnp-chief-to-shun-destructive-politics", "date": "2000-01-26T00:00:08+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 374},

The winter has ended so the feed demand is starting to pick up,\" said Ihtesham Shahjahan, president of Feed Industries Association Bangladesh. Last year, the feed market shrank 26 percent to 20-22 lakh tonnes from a year ago, according to some operators, as thousands suspended farming due to outbreaks of avian influenza. This year, however, the attacks have petered out, which encouraged many to resume farming, said Shahjahan, also managing director of Quality Feeds Ltd. \"The marginal farmers are returning after many days,\" said Fazle Rahim Khan, managing director of Aftab Bahumukhi Farms Ltd, which also makes feed. He said the price of day-old chicks needed for farming had been low last year, while market price for chicken and eggs were relatively better. \"As a result, many existing farmers made substantial profits in quick bursts. Plus, it encouraged many small farmers to come back.\" Khan said feed sales started regaining from the middle of January, with Aftab registering 15-20 percent sales growth in February year-on-year. \"The number of farmers has substantially increased in January and February. The feed demand in aquaculture farming has increased as well. It appears that everyone in the industry is happy.” Shahjahan said the whole feed industry might regain 50 percent of its lost sales this year.

{"title": "Yeltsin goes", "body": "President Boris Yeltsin announced on national television today that he had resigned and presidential elections will be held within 90 days to replace him, reports AP. The announcement caught Russia by total surprise, and is likely to launch the country into yet another political crisis as parties scramble for unexpected presidential elections. Prime Minister Vladmir Putin, the country's most popular politician, immediately took control of the government and will serve as acting president until the elections. Looking pale and grim in a speech on national television, the 68-year-old Yeltsin said it was time for him to go. He asked Russians to forgive him for his mistakes and failing to realise their dreams after the fall of the Soviet Union. \"Today, on the last day of the outgoing century, I resign,\" said Yeltsin, speaking in front of a gaily-decorated New Year's tree and a blue, red and white Russian flag with a golden Russian eagle. \"I am stepping down ahead of term. I understand that I must do it and Russia must enter the new millennium with new politicians, with new faces, with new intelligent, strong, energetic people, and we who have been in power for many years must go,\" Yeltsin said. It was yet another unexpected move by Yeltsin, who has presided over Russia through eight tumultuous, often chaotic years. His attempts to build a market economy were deeply flawed by corruption and incompetence, and he became widely disliked by most Russians. Looking emotional, Yeltsin asked several times for forgiveness for not solving Russia's problems. \"I beg your forgiveness for having failed to jump in one leap from the gray, stagnant, totalitarian past to the clear, rich and civilized future,\" he said. \"I am leaving. I've done what I could,\" he added. The Russian stock market jumped to a 15-month high on the news, with dealers saying the hopes of strong new leadership after Yeltsin would boost the economy. Yeltsin turned over to Putin the nuclear suitcase, which contains the codes to launch nuclear weapons. Yeltsin also gave Putin medals symbolizing his presidential status and his presidential pen, while Russia's Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II looked on. Yeltsin then left for his country residence outside Moscow, and Putin convened an emergency Cabinet session. The Kremlin said, Yeltsin still plans to travel to Bethlehem next month for Orthodox Christmas celebrations. \"The Yeltsin party of power has fallen,\" said Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who came in second in 1996 presidential elections. He called on his supporters to rally for a Communist presidential candidate. Under the Russian constitution, presidential elections must be held within 90 days of the president's resignation. The ITAR-Tass news agency said the presidential elections would be held around March 27. Putin, with effective control of the government, including state media, has a huge advantage in the race to succeed Yeltsin. Yeltsin, who has been hit by corruption allegations in recent months, reportedly had been looking for assurances for the safety of himself and his family when he steps down. Putin as president would be able to give Yeltsin the immunity he reportedly wants. Plagued for years by heart and other health problems, Yeltsin was often ill and out of sight during his second term. He spent many weeks sidelined at his country residence and was largely seen as a caretaker president. But Yeltsin continued to dominate Russian politics, despite his ill health. He easily defeated a Communist-led effort in May to impeach him and had dismissed four prime ministers in the last two years.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/yeltsin-goes", "date": "2000-01-01T00:01:07+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 584},

{"title": "The technology that could 'revolutionise' how people light the world", "body": "Kick-started by the invention of the light bulb, the way we illuminate our homes and our lives is ever-changing - particularly in a world where the challenge is to light more, but to consume less energy. But Mark Major, one of the world's leading lighting designers, believes we're at the early stages of a lighting revolution. \"Changing technology makes me feel very clearly that this is as much of a revolution going on now as perhaps when gas went out and electric lighting came in,\" he says. But what is it that makes something beautifully lit, and what role does technological innovation play in illuminating both our buildings and our state of well-being? Major's work - along with his late partner Jonathan Speirs - is award-winning, credited with enhancing the atmosphere of already iconic structures. It is arguably Speirs + Major's most distinctive work, unmissable to Londoners, that displays this like none other: St. Paul's Cathedral. \"It was a great privilege to work on that project,\" he says. \"Probably one of the toughest assignments we've ever had. It took about five years in its execution to design and have the lighting fully delivered.\" The result is a building swathed in soft light - giving the building a sense of serenity in the hustle and bustle of Britain's capital city. Inside, it was an even bigger task. \"When you're dealing with not just a heritage building, but a heritage building of that nature, you realise it was never really designed to be seen under artificial light in quite that way - it would have been seen in candlelight. \"You're placing, in a way, a new interpretation on the building and its architecture after dark, and you have to be very careful how you do that.\" As well as tremendous buildings - Speirs + Major also work with more practical locations such as offices or restaurants, and even our streets. \"On a very basic level,\" Major says, \"Well-designed lighting in the streets of cities doesn't just keep you safe and secure, but also can really help to create a pleasant and interesting atmosphere. \"It can bring out the colour and texture of the landscape, it can sort of direct you to places, it can play a number of different roles in the city that are more than simply enabling us to see - good lighting makes our cities more legible. \"And I hope, as a result, more enjoyable.\" He envisions a future where streets light up as you walk down them, but get dimmer when no-one's around, saving energy. Not only this, but the light can be used to change the very mood of the street depending on the occasion - a delicate skill. \"We all know the difference between a romantic candlelit supper for two, with that soft, warm, glowing light focal that makes your partner look wonderful, and sitting in a fast food restaurant under fluorescent lighting and what a grim experience that can be.\" This type of flexibility would not be possible with traditional filament bulbs. Advancements in light emitting diode (LED) technology means lighting specialists are able to come up with far more complex arrangements. \"We've moved a long way from candles and gaslights,\" Major says. \"LEDs are going to fundamentally revolutionise the way we work with light. \"It's smaller, it's cooler, and the quality of LED lighting has improved so much. Warmer light, broader spectrum, better skin tones, better reproduction of colour - just the overall quality.\" But there are downsides with this revolution, he argues. \"The more light we bring into the world, the greater some of the challenges become. \"Research is beginning to rapidly prove that you can have too much of a good thing - we all know about light pollution.\" And it's not just human beings who would be affected, Major says. \"Many creatures are adapted to the night - so by bringing along a lot of light we can really impact on their feeding habits, on their breeding patterns and all sorts of things. \"So we can enrich our lives, but we have to be quite careful how we work with this industrial material.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/the-technology-that-could-revolutionise-how-people-light-the-world", "date": "2013-03-18T03:12:08+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 692},

{"title": "SECOND LEAST LIVEABLE BUT...", "body": "One can list a multitude of reasons to not visit Bangladesh -- never ending traffic jam, incessant power cuts, air heavy with dust and pollution and thousands upon thousands of people thronging the streets every single day! Dhaka was ranked the second least liveable city among the world's 140 cities in this year's Global Liveability Index released by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Now let's be clear, it cannot be denied that there are more charming spots on earth than Dhaka -- what with the chaotic traffic system where cars, buses, rickshaws, bikes, people, donkeys and chickens share public space. The public infrastructure and health system are not very inviting either -- as people die in hospital elevators due to long power cuts. Many other reasons are there why European visitors should stay away from Dhaka, but there are at least 10 reasons why one should visit the second least liveable city in the world. Women are all over the city. Females are much more visible than they were 10 years ago. The young generation, in particular, is seen flocking to universities and going abroad to earn international degrees from reputed universities. Women lead businesses, earn money, are interested in politics and want to be independent. Females will be an even greater force in the years to come. If you want to see and feel women's motivation, Dhaka is the place to go. 2. NEVER ALONE, NEVER BORING Are you lonely once in a while? Is your boss not talking to you? Do your friends never have time for you? If you feel like you want a bit more attention, Dhaka is your city. Hundreds of rickshaw-pullers are eager to take you on board. If you decide to grab tea in a local tea-stall, you can be sure to get involved in discussions. So if you feel neglected, just take a walk through Dhaka. The city offers you thousands of faces; Bangladesh as a whole has about 1,000 people per square kilometre. That is four to five times more than what we experience in Switzerland, for example. So if you want to live the real \"density-stress\", here you go! Dhaka is never boring, I promise. 3. YOUNG PEOPLE Are you sick of the senile western cities, where more money is spent on elderly institutions than on anything else? Where demographics dominate every discussion? If yes, then Dhaka will be a refreshing change. Here, the young outnumber the old by miles. If you walk down the road and look at all the young faces -- which smile at you and are not looking into some digital device like back home -- you are reminded of your own youth, memories come flooding back. In the midst of young people, you feel young again. And unlike young people in Europe, young Bangladeshis are always up for a chat. 4. YES, WE CAN! The city is currently being rebuilt. Around every corner crumbling old buildings are taken down and replaced by surprisingly good architecture and modern designs. Even the sidewalks are being improved. Life in the city gets dangerous sometimes. The footpaths, which resemble Swiss cheese rather than sidewalks, can be a nightmare at times. Given that change is brewing, you can be there to see it. 5. OLD DHAKA The old part of the city is the craziest mix between modern life and medieval age you have ever seen. Chickens are slaughtered on the footpath next to a man repairing an iPhone 5. The roads in Old Dhaka are so narrow and intertwined and the centre so densely populated, you are sure to lose your way. So do take a native with you if you go there or you will have to stay there forever. But Old Dhaka is the ultimate place to go if you want to experience the chaotic yet oh so beautiful Dhaka. 6. DAY IS NIGHT AND NIGHT IS DAY Aren't you often frustrated if you can't find a warm dish after 10:00pm in European cities? In my home country, Switzerland, it is difficult to even find a cold dish after midnight. But in Dhaka, you will find warm food round-the-clock. Bangladeshis make no big difference between night and day. Little lights and fire sparkling along the streets are with you all night long and indicate where you are most likely to find a bite to eat -- at any time. And whereas in our world the roads after 10:00pm are often as dead as a cemetery, life in Dhaka goes on all night long. 7. FORKS AND KNIVES Compared to 10 years ago, many things in the city have changed already. Not only many more people wear western clothes (less lunghi), couples walk hand-in-hand through parks (not quite what you would expect in a Muslim country), and rickshaw-pullers communicate with their customers through mobile phones. One does not only find a cosy atmosphere and excellent food, the plate also comes automatically with forks and knives for visitors. 8. REAL VEGETABLES AND FRUITS Let's stay with food for a second longer. We in the West suffer from tasteless bananas, unripe mangos, and watery tomatoes. They are harvested too early in order to be shipped to us. That is why you will fall in love with Dhaka immediately if you like vegetables and fruits. At every corner of the city you'll find people displaying fruits and vegetables of the best quality. Just to look at the colourful display is a pleasure. Tasting them every morning for breakfast is like heaven. 9. BETTER THAN A BURNOUT CLINIC Are you stressed and feel like you would like to run on a lower gear for a while? People in the West are flocking to so called burnout clinics to get relief from their workload and stress. A stay in Dhaka would provide the same cure and would be much more fun than a clinic, and most probably even cheaper. Because whatever you plan to do in Dhaka, pressure of time does not exist as traffic in the city dictates your programme. You will probably hang around most of the time waiting for traffic jams to dissolve. So running on a high gear most of the time is impossible, giving you all the free time for reading, socialising and doing nothing as you always wished. Your blood pressure will most certainly decrease and there is no need for the expensive tranquiliser your doctor back home prescribed you to. You will be amazed at how much patience you can develop. 10. AN ORGANISED CHAOS Last but not least the organised chaos in the least liveable city of the world has a charming side to it. The honking horns, bells of rickshaws, the chatter and laughter of people, the cook-a-doodle-doo around the corner, and the colours in the bazaar all add to its charm. It is a world of mysteries and secrets to us who come from a frantically over-organised life where every minute of our day is scheduled and every train, which is a minute late, causes grim remarks. And surprisingly enough: most things you plan to do in Dhaka work out -- usually just a little later than you had planned. Yes -- Dhaka in many ways is a horrible place to live. But nevertheless there are enough reasons to visit this unique metropolis. So hurry up and book a flight to Dhaka as long as the city is still the second least liveable city on earth. Because be assured: times change. Don't be late! Are you lonely once in a while? Is your boss not talking to you? Do your friends never have time for you? If you feel like you want a bit more attention, Dhaka is your city. Hundreds of rickshaw-pullers are eager to take you on board.

But nevertheless there are enough reasons to visit this unique metropolis. So hurry up and book a flight to Dhaka as long as the city is still the second least liveable city on earth. Because be assured: times change. Don't be late! The city is currently being rebuilt. Around every corner crumbling old buildings are taken down and replaced by surprisingly good architecture and modern designs. Even the sidewalks are being improved. Life in the city gets dangerous sometimes. The footpaths, which resemble Swiss cheese rather than sidewalks, can be a nightmare at times. Given that change is brewing, you can be there to see it. 5. OLD DHAKA The old part of the city is the craziest mix between modern life and medieval age you have ever seen. Chickens are slaughtered on the footpath next to a man repairing an iPhone 5. The roads in Old Dhaka are so narrow and intertwined and the centre so densely populated, you are sure to lose your way. So do take a native with you if you go there or you will have to stay there forever. But Old Dhaka is the ultimate place to go if you want to experience the chaotic yet oh so beautiful Dhaka. 6. DAY IS NIGHT AND NIGHT IS DAY Aren't you often frustrated if you can't find a warm dish after 10:00pm in European cities? In my home country, Switzerland, it is difficult to even find a cold dish after midnight. But in Dhaka, you will find warm food round-the-clock. Bangladeshis make no big difference between night and day. Little lights and fire sparkling along the streets are with you all night long and indicate where you are most likely to find a bite to eat -- at any time. And whereas in our world the roads after 10:00pm are often as dead as a cemetery, life in Dhaka goes on all night long. 7. FORKS AND KNIVES Compared to 10 years ago, many things in the city have changed already. Not only many more people wear western clothes (less lunghi), couples walk hand-in-hand through parks (not quite what you would expect in a Muslim country), and rickshaw-pullers communicate with their customers through mobile phones. One does not only find a cosy atmosphere and excellent food, the plate also comes automatically with forks and knives for visitors. 8. REAL VEGETABLES AND FRUITS Let's stay with food for a second longer. We in the West suffer from tasteless bananas, unripe mangos, and watery tomatoes. They are harvested too early in order to be shipped to us. That is why you will fall in love with Dhaka immediately if you like vegetables and fruits. At every corner of the city you'll find people displaying fruits and vegetables of the best quality. Just to look at the colourful display is a pleasure. Tasting them every morning for breakfast is like heaven. 9. BETTER THAN A BURNOUT CLINIC Are you stressed and feel like you would like to run on a lower gear for a while? People in the West are flocking to so called burnout clinics to get relief from their workload and stress. A stay in Dhaka would provide the same cure and would be much more fun than a clinic, and most probably even cheaper. Because whatever you plan to do in Dhaka, pressure of time does not exist as traffic in the city dictates your programme. You will probably hang around most of the time waiting for traffic jams to dissolve. So running on a high gear most of the time is impossible, giving you all the free time for reading, socialising and doing nothing as you always wished. Your blood pressure will most certainly decrease and there is no need for the expensive tranquiliser your doctor back home prescribed you to. You will be amazed at how much patience you can develop. 10. AN ORGANISED CHAOS Last but not least the organised chaos in the least liveable city of the world has a charming side to it. The honking horns, bells of rickshaws, the chatter and laughter of people, the cook-a-doodle-doo around the corner, and the colours in the bazaar all add to its charm.

He said: \"It is very unfortunate that the opposition leader has categorically rejected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's offer to resolve the political standoff through dialogue, leaving no option for the government to explore.\" Dr Malek said there had been the possibility of enshrining parliamentary democracy in the country when Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina assumed office after winning people's mandate in free and fair general elections on June 12, 1996. \"But a certain quarter became active to foil parliamentary democracy as soon as Sheikh Hasina took office,\" he said, adding, \"Begum Zia threatened to oust the present government just 90 days after it assumed power.\" Dr Malek called upon the intellectuals not to hesitate to protect democracy at a time when opposition political parties are mapping out a sinister blueprint to destroy it. The discussion was also addressed by Chairman of Public Administration Reform Commission (PARC) A T M Shamsul Huq, General Secretary of Sangsadia Ganotantra Parishad Dr Harun-ur-Rashid, Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University Dr A K Azad Chowdhury, Pro-Vice Chancellor Mohammad Shahadat Ali, Dr Shamsul Huda Harun, Prof Ali Asgar, Prof Imamul Huq, Prof Mejbauddin Ahmed, Chairman of Bangladesh Muktijodda Central Command Council Principal Ahad Chowdhury, and President of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalist (BFUJ) Abul Kalam Azad. Justice K M Sobhan presided over the function. He said: 'The Opposition is the alternative government in a parliamentary democracy. If the government fails to run the state, the opposition takes power as an alternative government in the parliamentary system of government.\" He said the opposition was not following the parliamentary norms and practices. \"It is not clear to many of us on which grounds the opposition staged walkout within five minutes on the first day's sitting of parliament,\" he added. Criticising opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia for her declaration that hartal will be used to create a deadlock, Justice Sobhan said the people will pay eventually for such actions. He also questioned the logic of the anti-government movement of the opposition. Dr Shamsul Huda Harun said, \"No government would be able to run the country, if the opposition does not play its due role in a parliamentary democracy.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/call-to-protect-parliamentary-democracy", "date": "2000-01-28T00:00:00+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 422},

{"title": "Activists fight back", "body": "The truth is many shades of grey. There are thousands of young people who are filling the ranks of new organisations like Not In Our Name, United For Peace, Drum (Deshis Rising Up in Movement), SAPBR (South Asians against Police Brutality & Racism) and International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War & End Racism). But you wouldn't know all this from watching CNN! The mainstream press is working overtime to hide these facts. But behind the scenes, on the streets, through the Internet and in alternative media outlets, a resistance movement is growing. WHEN bad times come, there can also be a positive side effect. It wakes many of us from lethargy and apathy. That is what is happening in an America changed by September 11. As civil liberties and immigrant rights are attacked, and the Pentagon beats the war-drums, the activist community is waking up and mobilizing in unprecedented numbers. They are taking their dissent to the streets, to the college campuses, and to the internet. During the 1960's Vietnam protests, the slogan was \"Hell No, We Won't Go\". In 2003, the slogan is \"Not In Our Name.\" I arrived here for college thirteen years ago. For the first few years, many of our activist projects in the US were involved with Bangladesh. As recent arrivals from Bangladesh, we were still intimately connected with issues \"back home\". Fundraising for floods, campus events, letters to the editor -- the usual things. The earliest petition we wrote was in the early '90s, urging ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) to rescind a conference invitation to war criminal Ghulam Azam. That petition did not succeed in convincing ISNA. Instead, I got a hostile call from one of their officers. The man on the phone called me \"brother\" (which always make me suspicious) and asked me to amend my ways -- as if speaking out against a 1971 war criminal was blasphemy. We had the wind briefly taken out of our sails by that failure, but the activism continued. Over the years, many more Bangladesh petitions were written. The Shobak. Org website's back pages are littered with petitions for Badruddin Omar (the banned 21st February article), Farhad Mazhar (arrest after \"Ansar rebellion\" article), Rahnuma Ahmed (JU campus sexual harassment cases), and others. After a few years of living here, our activism shifted to take on more of our immediate surroundings. We started becoming involved in \"American issues.\" The first Gulf War came along, our main project became anti-war protests. A South Asian identity became less important, this was a larger struggle against imperialist adventures. \"No Blood For Oil\" t-shirts were everywhere. With the end of that war, the peace movement ran out of steam. Domestic crises engaged us. A doctor was shot dead outside an abortion clinic. People formed human chains to protect the clinics. Affirmative Action was under attack in colleges, and we marched with Black students to protest. Genetically Modified foods became a hot topic, and neighborhoods petitioned supermarkets to start carrying organic food. The Globalization movement started forming, culminating in the watershed protests at Seattle. Then came the xenophobia tide led by California's Proposition 187 and Peter Brimelow's book \"ALIEN NATION\". Although Brimelow was a British immigrant, he spoke out against the \"wrong type of immigrants\" (smelly brown ones). The first attack on the World Trade Centre happened (everything in our present day is like a sequel to an old film)... Immigrants were suddenly in the spotlight. But the Oklahoma bombing helped push things in the other direction. When Timothy McVeigh was arrested, Connie Chung and other TV reporters who had immediately blamed Arabs were on the defensive. White extremists were a problem for those who wanted to pin all terrorism on the \"dark hordes\". During this phase of the struggle, we found new allies among the country's huge Latino population. Returning home one night, I saw a convoy of police cars near my Hell's Kitchen apartment. \"Must be an accident,\" I thought. The next morning I learnt that Patrick Dorismond had been shot on that block, by a police officer who thought he was reaching for a gun. Investigations found that he was unarmed! Soon after that, Amadou Diallo was shot 41 times by the police -- he was only reaching for his wallet! New York city exploded with pent-up racial tension. A black man in Harlem ran in front of a TV camera, holding up his one-year old baby. \"Shoot him now,\" he screamed, \"You'll do it anyway. There ain't no place for a 'nigger' in this country.\" Even though Amadou was an immigrant, the struggle for him became a Black struggle. Although these were bad times, it was exhilarating to go to rallies in Harlem and see so many Asian faces along with Black faces. When one rally blocked Times Square, the plastic handcuffs came out and police started chasing the protesters and herding them into vans. As we ran away from the police, I found myself running next to a co-worker from my office. \"What are you doing here?\" she said. \"Why shouldn't I be here?\" I replied. Both of us had worked at a corporate television network for two years without being aware of each other's politics -- we had kept our secrets well. Protestors started calling New York a \"police state\". People were constantly protesting the NYPD's tactics. The police were getting used to meeting protesters who would hold up a wallet and chant, \"Police Training 101/It's a wallet not a gun\" and \"It doesn't take 41/To kill a man without a gun\". The Community board started putting up pacification posters that read, \"New York needs CPR= Community, Police, Respect.\" People would deface or rip down those posters. Like an army under siege, the police responded by getting more aggressive. Transportation Alternatives arranged monthly bicycle rides where we bikers would take over city streets and bike down to the World Trade Centre -- to show support for car-free streets. These events were very innocuous; we had never had any trouble. That year, I watched horrified as our bike convoy got stopped, again at Times Square, and police started grabbing the leaders and shoving them into vans. Arrested for riding a bike, no one got believe it! Infuriated riders started head butting the police, inflaming the crowd further. Shouts of \"Shame, Shame\" filled the air. Everything was volatile in New York. Mayor Giuliani managed to infuriate people no matter what he did. The Brooklyn Museum showed England's \"Sensation\" art exhibit. Giuliani tried to block the show, claiming it was anti-church. People lined up around the block to get in, their way of giving the middle finger to \"Herr Giuliani\". When more cases of police brutality happened, the Mayor tried to talk about falling crime rates (which, to give the devil his due, were true)-- but no one was listening. Then came September 11. Overnight, the whole city changed. The once-hated NYPD police became heroes (deservedly), as did the Fire Department. With a huge death toll, they earned our respect. Young kids, who were once so hostile to the police, now nodded in grudging respect. Mayor Giuliani garnered many positive reviews by speaking out against attacks on immigrants, and putting convoys of police in front of Arab stores in Brooklyn. TIME magazine put him on the cover as \"Man Of The Year\" and even my activist friends did not complain. These were different times now. But after September 11 came the new anti-immigrant backlash. Not so much Muslim-phobia, as it was phobia of the new and different. In America's recent past, the Irish, Italian, Spanish, Jews, Blacks and East Asians were being called \"Mick\", \"Wop\", \"Spic\", \"Kike\", \"Nigger\" and \"Chink\". I once saw a restaurant sign from the 1930s that read \"No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs\". Arabs and Muslims were just the newest group to receive the baton of hatred that had been passed down through generations. But there are some bright spots as well. The average American is not as xenophobic as 10 years ago; there are many more open-minded people. Some of the strongest voices for immigrant rights come from white Americans who have lived here for generations. The Jewish community, which was refused permission to immigrate during the Holocaust, has come out against INS Registrations. The Japanese-American community, remembering their own forced internments in 1940, has organized their own rallies. The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) is a strong voice for civil liberties, and their membership has jumped since 9/11. But there is also a deadly combination of a powerful White House, and a Republican-controlled Senate, Congress, and Supreme Court. What is to be feared are the draconian immigration and surveillance laws that they will pass in these moments. The activist fight is now against passage of those laws. To quote the over-used Dickens line: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" The unprecedented attack on civil liberties, the immigration crackdown and the impending war on Iraq have mobilised many thousands of activists. At the October 26th Washington DC rally, 200,000 people showed up. I was stunned at the sheer size of the rally and the enthusiasm of the crowd. A friend and I started doing a Bengali chant \"Mani Na, Manbo Na.\" Three teenagers came over and asked us what it meant. Then they tried to imitate us, mangling the words in their mid-western accents. Finally giving up, one of them gave me a \"high five\" and ran off to join a large group of high school students. There they resumed their previous chant: \"Hell no we won't go/We won't kill for Texaco!\" I stared at them amazed -- they were not even old enough to go to war, and here they were, protesting with gusto! Don't believe the hype about lazy, video game playing, apathetic teenagers. The truth is many shades of grey. There are thousands of young people who are filling the ranks of new organisations like Not In Our Name, United For Peace, Drum (Deshis Rising Up in Movement), SAPBR (South Asians against Police Brutality & Racism) and International ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War & End Racism). But you wouldn't know all this from watching CNN! The mainstream press is working overtime to hide these facts. But behind the scenes, on the streets, through the Internet and in alternative media outlets, a resistance movement is growing. January 18th is the next big anti-war rally in Washington DC. Thousands make their voices heard again. They are taking the \"Pledge Of Resistance\" and saying: \"Not in our name will you wage endless war Not by our mouths Will we let fear silence us Another world is possible and we pledge to make it real.\" Naeem Mohaiemen runs Shobak.Org, a website for \"Outsider Asian Voices\".", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/activists-fight-back", "date": "2003-01-19T00:00:50+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 1800},
{"title": "Don't Force People to Lose Faith in Polls", "body": "THANKS to the hardened position of both the ruling and the opposition parties, the country's electoral process itself stands largely redefined at present. Boycott, widespread violence and distressingly poor voter turnout have marked all the elections held in recent times, the Chittagong City Corporation polls being the latest on the list. Gunshots and bomb blasts throughout the day turned the port city into a veritable battle-ground. While the opposition activists engaged in a day-long brawl with the law enforcers, majority of the electorate preferred staying indoors to exercising their right to franchise. The net result has been yet another election under the present government that can be called anything but participatory. While the opposition's the boycott of process told upon the credibility of the elections, poor voter turnout essentially decimated the representative character of the local government bodies. Similar has been the case with the recent by-elections to Tangail-8, Serajganj-7, Rajshahi-1 and Kishoreganj-1 constituencies late last year. Rationality of the opposition resolution to boycott any election under the incumbent chief election commissioner and government is indeed disputable and, in fact, this paper has vehemently criticised such a hardened position editorially on several occasion. Appallingly, in the midst of intense debate over the political position of the 'combatants', we have failed to appreciate the erosion the stand-off is causing to the country's democratic institutions. Already, the parliament has become a casualty of the prevailing deadlock. By pushing such unilateral and violence-prone elections the government is actually taxing the electorate's patience which is manifestly running out. The poor turnout in successive polls is a proof of that. It could easily have worked on ways to woo the opposition into the electoral fray through negotiations. Towards that end, the first step should have been deferment of the polls. In fact, the Election Commission had reportedly advised the government likewise. But the latter didn't budge and the one-sided elections and hartal were forced upon the Chittagonians. We are afraid that if the trend continues it will eventually leave the country with an electorate indifferent to the electoral process itself.

They could not prepare themselves for the exams due to some unscheduled closure of the university in recent times, they claimed. \"But the sudden closure of the university has created an uncertain situation on academic activities,\" said one of the students, wishing not to be named.

An hour before the Jatiya Sangsad went into session at 4:05 pm yesterday, President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed requested the BNP secretary general over telephone to join the parliament session and call off the 18-hour hartal beginning this morning, sources in the BNP said. If the opposition agreed to the proposal, the President assured the BNP leader that he would use his good office so that the governing party deferred the already announced schedule for the municipal elections to a date acceptable to the opposition, the sources added. When BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan pointed out to the President that the resignation of Chief Election Commissioner was very important to the opposition, the President said that it was not possible 'right at the moment', according to the sources. Bhuiyan, however, communicated the presidential proposal to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who eventually found the proposition to be unacceptable, a top ranking BNP leader told The Daily Star. While talking with her party secretary general on the issue, Khaleda Zia also told him that the opposition did not have any room for compromise over the CEC's resignation. Besides, she wanted to know whether the ruling party had contacted any BNP leader. On a negative reply from Bhuiyan, she told him that it was useless to consider the question of attending the inaugural session or calling off the countrywide hartal. Later, Bhuiyan regretted the President's proposal, and then the President entered the House at 6:00 pm to deliver his address with most opposition benches empty. Meanwhile, Telecommunication Minister Mohammad Nasim told The Daily Star that the ruling party had so far made no communication with the opposition for a dialogue. He was rather optimistic that the opposition would join the session when it resumes on January 31. \"I see no reason for the opposition to stay away from parliament.

{"title": "To tackle or not to tackle?", "body": "MILAN, Feb 3 (AFP): \"Who wants to end up like Ciro Ferrara, with a broken leg and no chance of the World Cup finals?\" That's the question which Italian club coaches are hoping their players won't be asking themselves too often in the coming weeks after the Juventus and international defender ruled himself out of France '98 on Sunday. The next few months are crucial for Serie A sides, who are vying for the league title, the Italian Cup and all three European Cup competitions. Their coaches, some of whose jobs could be at stake, will be expecting them to risk everything in the headlong rush towards a trophy. However, a great many players here in the Serie A, whether they're European, South American or African, are also expecting to play in the World Cup finals soon after the season ends. Ferrara's total commitment to the Juventus cause, seen in the 50-50 ball he lunged for on Sunday against Lecce, means that he is now certain to watch the finals at home on television. How many will now want to follow his example? Who really wants to rip a thigh muscle two weeks before flying to France? The fear of missing the tournament of a lifetime in a single tackle is very real. However, players and coaches claimed this week that there were even greater fears for the players - failure to get picked in the first place, or the risk of an even more serious injury by holding themselves back. Pierluigi Casiraghi, who will lead Italy's attack at France '98, said: \"I'm sorry for Ferrara, but no player who's line for a place at the World Cup finals should be influenced by incidents like that. \"In this game, injuries can happen at any time, even in training. A footballer should just concentrate on playing football. End of story.\"And he added: \"The moment you start being frightened of getting hurt, that's just when you can really get seriously injured.\"Juventus coach Marcello Lippi, whose team is packed with internationals and is on course for the league title, the European Cup and the Italian Cup, also hopes there will be no Ferrara-effect on his teammates. \"All the Serie A players are true professionals, and are used to the fast and physically demanding football that's being played today,\" Lippi said. \"They know the risks. I don't think that what happened to Ferrara is going to make people start taking things easier, or make them reluctant to throw themselves at a loose ball. Fear always increases the risks of getting hurt.\"Inter Milan's latest hero, Uruguayan striker Alvaro Recoba, also believes that players will still give everything in the months ahead. But he also reckons the injury issue may yet re-surface, this time as an excuse. \"In Italy, even friendlies are played at 100 per cent,\" said the 21-year-old, whose country failed to qualify for France '98. \"So I don't think the World Cup finals will influence the way people play. I've got the example here from my teammates - Ronaldo, Youri Djorkaeff and Ivan Zamorano will be among the stars of the tournament. They never hold anything back. They're just like Ferrara. \"They may play well, or they might not play well in some matches, but I've never seen them back off from the ball.\"\"I think this talk about the World Cup influencing players might often be used as an excuse, as a way of covering things up.\"", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/to-tackle-or-not-to-tackle", "date": "1998-02-04T00:00:06+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 574},
{"title": "US takes hard line on Saddam's latest ultimatums", "body": "WASHINGTON, Jan 19: Responding to Saddam Hussein's latest ultimatums, US officials stressed Sunday that Iraq not only must allow weapons inspections but must show a commitment to peace before crippling trade sanctions can end, reports AP. Republican leaders went further. They said it's time for the United States to issue its own ultimatum that the Iraqi president must either cooperate or face US military retaliation. \"The burden of proof is on Saddam Hussein,\" Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on NBC television. \"The bottom line here is, has Saddam isolated himself by not fulfilling the obligations that have been laid on him by the Security Council.\"Saddam, in a speech Saturday marking the seventh anniversary of the Gulf War, threatened to bar future UN weapons inspections if sanctions against Iraq are not lifted. Widespread military training of Iraqis was ordered. Saddam's speech also came on the eve of a visit to Baghdad by chief UN arms inspector Richard Butler. He said he will state plainly to the Iraqis that the inspection teams must have total freedom of movement, including access to presidential palaces that the Iraqis have declared off limits. \"There can be no such sanctuary,\" Butler said on CNN. \"That's what I will be putting before (Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister) Tariq Aziz.\"Administration officials insisted the policy of applying diplomatic pressure through the United Nations is working. \"There are no prospects of sanctions being lifted,\" said Bill Richardson, America's UN ambassador. Saddam has \"got the (UN) Security Council against him and we have once again a state of desperation on his part,\" Richardson said on ABC television. \"I don't want to saber-rattle,\" he said, but \"What Ambassador Butler's trip brings back will be a very important threshold.\"White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger repeated on CBS television that the United States is prepared to use unilateral military force against Iraq if that becomes necessary. But Republican Sen John McCain told CBS that the time has come for an ultimatum. He said military action now appears inevitable. And unlike the limited military strikes of the past that did little damage to Saddam, McCain said, this time the attacks should be crushing. He said there should be sustained air operations against Saddam's Republican Guard and his facilities, including his palaces. \"It's time that he understood that we're serious about complying with the agreements signed,\" McCain said. Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott also urged a more forceful US policy against Iraq. \"We cannot tolerate or allow him to do what he is threatening to do,\" he said on CNN. Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, appearing on Fox and NBC, said Saddam had no choice but to set a deadline for an end to the inspections. They are unfair, Hamdoon said, and US policy has been to continue sanctions even if Iraq proves it no longer has weapons of mass destruction. He strongly denied recent reports that Iraq has used human subjects to test its chemical weapons. Meanwhile, as Iraq steps up preparation for a possible military confrontation over UN arms inspections, the chief international inspector is travelling to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi leaders. Richard Butler's visit today comes at a time of renewed tensions between Iraq and the United States, the chief proponent of the inspections. Iraqi officials, fearing an American military strike, urged residents Sunday to volunteer for weapons training. Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan accused the United States of \"increasing its aggressive stands\" to prolong UN economic sanctions. Reuter adds: Iraq declared holy war on UN sanctions today, calling for a one-million volunteer force to push for an end to the seven-year-old embargo it says has caused widespread starvation and death. \"We are determined to carry out a great Jihad to lift sanctions,\" Vice-President Taha Yassin Ramadan said. \"There is no alternative to this after seven years of patience and cooperation with the United Nations and its committees.\"However, Washington immediately rejected Baghdad's ultimatum and insisted that Iraq must first comply with all UN resolutions for sanctions to be lifted. \"It is not upto Saddam Hussein to be offering this kind of ultimatum ... sanctions will stay on until he carries out his obligations, which is to come clean on the weapons of mass destruction,\" Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in Washington. Official Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Ramadan as saying one million people, men and women, would be given weapons training in a volunteer force from the start of next month. Iraq called on people early today to register for the training by next month. \"The Defence Ministry calls on all Iraqi men and women ... to enlist in popular training which will take place in all governorates of the country from the first of February,\" the agency said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/us-takes-hard-line-on-saddams-latest-ultimatums", "date": "1998-01-20T00:00:25+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 793},

{"title": "Deadly mosque attack kills 49 in Damascus", "body": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to \"cleanse\" his country of extremism yesterday, a day after a suicide bomber killed more than 45 people including a key pro-regime Sunni cleric in a mosque. The attack was also condemned by the opposition, who raised the possibility that the regime was behind the deadly blast at the Iman Mosque in Damascus on Thursday night. State news agency SANA said that 49 people had been killed, including Mohamed Saeed al-Bouti, the most prominent Sunni cleric to back Assad's regime against a Sunni-led uprising. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 46, saying that around 15 of the wounded were in critical condition and the toll was likely to rise. The attack came as heavy fighting raged across Syria, and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said the United Nations would investigate whether chemical weapons have been used in the conflict. Bouti's death is a blow to Assad's regime, which has been fighting an insurgency that flared when his forces launched a bloody crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired democracy protests that erupted in March 2011. The relentless violence has killed more than 70,000 people, according to UN figures, and caused more than one million to flee their homes as refugees. In a statement issued by the presidency, Assad condemned the attack and mourned Bouti's death, vowing to eradicate \"extremism and ignorance\" in Syria. \"I swear to the Syrian people that your blood, and that of your grandson and all the martyrs of the homeland, will not be spilled in vain because we will be faithful to your ideas by destroying their extremism and ignorance until we have cleansed the country,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/deadly-mosque-attack-kills-45-in-damascus", "date": "2013-03-23T00:00:59+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 279},

{"title": "Hasina speaks of Asian energy grid", "body": "\"India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are located at the cross-roads between West and Central Asia on the one hand and East and South East Asia on the other. Our meeting today reflects our shared commitment to join hands in working for a better future for the 1.2 billion people in our three countries. Our three countries share a common history and a common heritage. India and Pakistan are celebrating 50 years of independence. We share your sense of joy and optimism about the future. We too recently celebrated the Silver Jubilee of our independence. Each of our countries values and cherishes our independence and sovereignty. Indians, Pakistanis and Bangalees are nationalists to the core. We take great pride in the many achievements of our respective countries. But we are also hardheaded realists. The world has indeed undergone a dramatic transformation during the past decades. Globalisation and liberalisation today dominate the world economic agenda. We are aware that our three countries today constitute the largest single concentration of poverty in the world. We can overcome our poverty and bring prosperity to our region if we can forge strong economic links among ourselves. We must work together to realise our full potential. Our enormous market, our untapped natural resources and above all, our vast human resources can convert our region into one of the most prosperous in the world. Indeed the forecast for 1998 is that South Asia's growth will be at least six per cent, the highest for any region in the world. We had an excellent SAARC summit in Male this year. Regional cooperation in South Asia has taken firm root. Our achievements in the field of poverty alleviation and reduction of tariffs are quite commendable. But we need to do much more to catch up with the rest of the world, particularly to match the high rates of growth achieved by some of our fellow Asian countries in the recent past. * The identification of \"regional best practices\" as followed by the European Union (EU) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) regional blocs, where the best practices for a particular economic reform by one country is adopted by all others on a reciprocal basis. * We may set up a task force made up of senior officials from the three governments as well as representatives of the private sector, to look into improved road, rail and air links between our countries. * An Asian energy grid could be of enormous benefit to all of our countries. Such a grid system could extend eventually all the way from Turkmenistan to Singapore. * I would urge His Excellency Mr. Gujral to urgently consider Bangladesh's proposal for giving zero tariff access to exports from the four South Asian LDCs into India. At the same time I would request His Excellency Mr. Nawaz Sharif to examine the possibility of extending this facility. In the meantime, I would urge you to at least remove the duty on Bangladesh tea, so that we can re-establish our market in Pakistan. * In order to follow up on our deliberations in this summit, I would like to propose that the Finance and Commerce Ministers of our three countries should meet by the middle of this year. Prior to their meeting, a task force made up of senior officials and representatives of the private sector would put forward some specific recommendations for their consideration, including the possible setting up of some trilateral joint venture industries. Within SAARC itself, we need to increasingly cooperate on specific projects. We need to improve the environment for business and investment. Our infrastructure must match that of the more advanced countries - our ports, railways, telecommunications, civil aviation, roads and highways must be of the highest standard. We must ensure an abundance of electricity at competitive rates. Our bureaucracies must show a high level of efficiency. In this effort to accelerate the rate of growth and create a healthy environment for business and investment our three countries must take the lead. In Mr. Gujral and Mr. Nawaz Sharif, we are fortunate to have two men with a clear vision for their own people and also for South Asia. Mr. Gujral's firm commitment to improving relations with India's neighbours has already shown some very positive results. He, above all, realises that any meaningful regional cooperation must take into account the size of India as well as the political sensitivities of its neighbours. Mr. Nawaz Sharif's resounding electoral victory has given him a golden opportunity to take some bold policy initiatives. His own invaluable experience as a successful entrepreneur has been a major asset for Pakistan. These two visionary men have shown a sense of determination to put India-Pakistan relations on a better footing. We, in Bangladesh, pray that their noble efforts are crowned with success. Peaceful co-existence between India and Pakistan is of great importance in ensuring peace, stability and economic development in South Asia. When I became Prime Minister in June 1996, I realised that to achieve this goal I would have to follow an innovative approach towards accelerating economic development in the country. It was essential to reach development to the villages, focus on human development and improve infrastructure within the country. Moreover, our foreign policy would have to be energised. In particular, it was necessary to strengthen relations with all our neighbours in South Asia and intensify our work to make regional cooperation a reality. We have to create conditions to attract foreign direct investment and intensify the economic interaction among ourselves. This would require forging an effective partnership between government and the private sector. Each of us may be doing this already in our respective countries but it is essential that we, the three largest economies come together to chalk out a plan of action. I am grateful to both Mr. Nawaz Sharif and Mr. Gujral that when I put forward the proposal for a business summit to them last year, they readily accepted my proposal with great enthusiasm. This summit, the first of its kind, must send a clear and powerful signal to the rest of the world: Firstly, that we in South Asia provide excellent investment opportunities for foreign investors. Secondly, that we are collectively committed to create a congenial environment for business. Thirdly, that our governments will work closely with the investors and with each other in putting the required infrastructure in place to facilitate business and investment. Fourthly, that we would encourage our own private sectors to interact more closely with each other, to expand trade and set up joint ventures. Let me now put forward some specific proposals on the form and substance of the cooperation that may take place among us: 1) The summit should set directions for close interaction between the private sectors and government representatives of the three countries. This would enhance mutual understanding of the view points and challenges faced by each country, as the region tries to integrate in a number of different sectors. Such interaction will set the stage for future dialogue between the private and public sectors of the three countries. 2) Specific issues pertaining to private sector initiatives in certain areas and regulatory changes in others could be discussed thereby providing tangible inputs to future negotiations at the inter-governmental level. 3) In the course of economic liberalisation, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan would have enacted substantive and meaningful changes in their foreign investment and import and export trade laws. Cooperation of these initiatives among the three countries could lead to a uniform economic regime supported by a common regulatory framework. This would provide the three countries with many competitive advantages. 4) In order to enhance trade among the three countries, there is the imperative need for harmonisation of customs procedures, improvement of shipping and port facilities and simplification of visa procedures for businessmen and investors. 5) The identification of \"regional best practices\" as followed by the European Union (EU) and North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) regional blocs, where the best practices for a particular economic reform by one country is adopted by all others on a reciprocal basis. 6) We may set up a task force made up of senior officials from the three governments as well as representatives of the private sector, to look into improved road, rail and air links between our countries. The Asian highway and railway will pass through our three countries linking us on the one side to Central Asia and Europe, and on the other side to China and the ASEAN countries. Improved communications will also be of immense benefit to each of our countries, particularly, for our private sector. 7) The opportunities in the energy sector should be fully realised. An Asian energy grid could be of enormous benefit to all of our countries. Such a grid system could extend eventually all the way from Turkmenistan to Singapore. 8) We must work more closely together to create improved facilities for the training of our manpower. It is especially important that our private sector fully understand the implications of globalisation and the need for each of us to be more and more competitive. 9) I would urge His Excellency Mr. Gujral to urgently consider Bangladesh's proposal for giving zero tariff access to exports from the four South Asian LDCs into India. At the same time I would request His Excellency Mr. Nawaz Sharif to examine the possibility of extending this facility. In the meantime, I would urge you to at least remove the duty on Bangladesh tea, so that we can re-establish our market in Pakistan. 10) In order to follow up on our deliberations in this summit, I would like to propose that the Finance and Commerce Ministers of our three countries should meet by the middle of this year. Prior to their meeting, a task force made up of senior officials and representatives of the private sector would put forward some specific recommendations for their consideration, including the possible setting up of some trilateral joint venture industries. Before I conclude, I would like to stress once again that our summit in Dhaka offers us a unique opportunity to set the tone for a more meaningful cooperation in the fields of business and investment. We, three Prime Ministers, can commit ourselves to do everything possible to encourage our private sectors to play a more dynamic role in bringing new life and meaning to the process of regional cooperation in South Asia. I hope our meeting today will mark the beginning of a new period of mutual trust and confidence among us. Let us be inspired by a vision of a South Asian community, a community where fear and suspicion is replaced by a sense of well-being, a community free of poverty where each of our citizens can lead a life of dignity, free from hunger and illiteracy.

{"title": "First birds had 4 wings", "body": "Anchiornis huxley, a small, feathered, dinosaur, showing a second set of wings on its legs. Photo: Dailymail Researchers have uncovered new evidence that the first birds had four wings instead of two. A team from China say they flew rather like a biplane -- with wings on their legs providing a second boost. The team analysed 11 bird skeletons from between 150 and 100 million years ago, and believe they eventually shed the second set so they could use their legs more effectively. Led by Xiaoting Zheng of China's Linyi University, the authors of the new study analysed the bird skeletons donated by various collectors to the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature. The 11 birds come from five species and were relatively robust: larger than a crow but smaller than a turkey. Recently, several fossils have shown that some dinosaurs had large feathers on both fore limbs and hind limbs. But, until now, no examples of this four-winged body plan have been described in birds -- or even in their most recently extinct relatives. Zheng and colleagues studied fossils in China's Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature and identified 11 primitive bird species with clear signs of feathered hind legs. Modern birds have two types of feathers: vaned feathers that cover the outside of the body, and the down feathers that grow underneath them. The Chinese team found that one type of vaned plumage, also known as pennaceous feathers, was neatly preserved in skeletal fossils of these specimens, along each creatures' hind limbs. These findings suggest that this four-winged condition preceded the two-winged body plan, and that birds have gradually lost the feathers on their hind limbs over evolutionary time. In a related news article also published in Science, Michael Balter compares the ancient birds to biplanes in the early 1900s, which were later phased out in favour of faster monoplanes. The study adds to existing theories that suggest the first birds flew with four wings.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/first-birds-had-4-wings", "date": "2013-03-16T00:00:29+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 325},
{"title": "More Positive Assurance Needed", "body": "With the setting up of government of BJP-led alliance at the centre in India its minority communities are apprehending their uncertain political and economic future because of inclusion of certain fundamentalist Hindu leaders such as L K Advani, M M Joshi and Arun Jaitley. The role of Advani in the destruction of Babri Mosque has already been revealed. The real motive behind Joshi's Hindutva cultural project \"Bharatya culture\" has been reflected in the district education programme \"Sarva Shiksha Abhijan\" that this programme aims at imposing Hindu culture throughout India. Arun Jaitley's wish has been gradually revealed in various mass media programmes. Apart from this, BJP extremists are trying to disturb the communal harmony in West Bengal, Bihar, Gujrat, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh. However, we wish that these Hindu fundamentalists cannot be effective in future because after the demolition of Babri Mosque BJP had to forsake its agenda to come to power and the present government is a coalition government which has to accommodate the wishes of the BJP allies. Though apparently Pakistan was created on a two-nation theory, it may not be too difficult to prove that Pakistan became a reality mainly because of (i) failure of Mohammad Ali Jinnah to fulfil his dream as a Congress leader; (ii) Jawaharlal Nehru's inadequate political foresight; and (iii) British government's wish to divide and rule to maintain economic control on the sub-continent (as long as possible). It was mainly exploitation of religious sentiment of the common people, majority of whom were poor and illiterate and as such incapable of understanding political strategies and intricacies. Ever since the creation of Pakistan its senior politicians and bureaucrats were apprehensive of pressure from the people of its eastern part for a fair share in employment and economic activities with the rise of literacy. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who used to consider the eastern wing as an 'outpost' of Pakistan, advised them to make the western wing self-sufficient as quickly as possible so that west Pakistanis needed not to depend for anything on the eastern wing. As such all policies (at least the major ones) were formulated mainly for the benefit of west Pakistanis only. Subsequent developments, particularly during the so-called 'golden era' of Ayub Khan prove the point. The foundation of Pakistan was based more on sentiment and less on cool logic. A modern state can never flourish on the basis of religion alone. Other than religion east Pakistanis had nothing common with the west Pakistanis. Some twenty-five years back Clarence Maloney in his book Peoples of South Asia (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc New York, 1974) rightly observed:' the disunity within Pakistan was apparent from the start. Religion proved inadequate to hold different peoples together in amity. The west Pakistani tended to look down on Bengali Muslims as second class Muslims, descendants of converts and do not in the same direct line of religious family as those who brought Islam to the country. The Punjabi Muslims see themselves as direct heirs to the ruling tradition of the Mughal territory. Thus there was deep seated cultural prejudice current at the birth of Pakistan.\" Bangladesh achieved its independence through a nine-month long liberation war in which more or less all the religious minorities contributed because they hoped that independent Bangladesh would be a secular democratic state where all its people would be free to lead a peaceful life with complete religious freedom and where all will be equal before law. After independence, however, things did not proceed as anticipated. Though the then AL government could adopt secularism as one of the state principles it did not get enough time to nullify the anti-Hindu Acts (such as Enemy Property Act) imposed by the then Pakistan. Far from redressing the problems of the Hindus Zia knocked out the principle of secularism. Both Zia and Ershad were interested in the Islamisation of the constitution and ignored the problems of the minorities. In fact Zia's ill-advised policy in regard to CHT increased the suffering of the tribals there. As CHT was a political problem it was beyond the capability of a military ruler like Ershad to solve it. Geographically Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India and Myanmar. India is a Hindu-majority country and Myanmar is Buddhist dominated. It may further be added that eastern part of India (bordering Bangladesh) is dominated by Buddhist Christians and tribals. It would, therefore, be most pragmatic for Bangladesh not only to tolerate these cultures but also to encourage development of their cultures so that political relations of Bangladesh with its neighbours are developed on a warmer and firmer footing. This will help her much to quicken the pace of development of trade and economic relations. It is indeed surprising that despite long experience of ruling the country for twenty years (11yrs by BNP and 9 yrs by JP) both BNP and JP are trying to raise the issue of religion in the name of so called \"nationalist parties\". For them it may be useful to raise the religious sentiment of the illiterate and simple voters through publicising that Awami League is a pro-Indian and secular party and as such not enough committed to protect Islam, the religion of the majority people of Bangladesh, but it would certainly be harmful for the country in the long run. Some may argue that while communal riots frequently occur in India (which is a secular state) why Bangladesh should try to be secular in letter and spirit. There may be good reasons as to why Bangladesh should not follow India in her policy toward the minorities. The following reasons may be identified: i) the constitution of Bangladesh is not based on two-nation theory; ii) the exodus of Hindus from Pakistan was because of anti-Hindu polices adopted by the then Pakistan governments; iii) it would be improper for Bangladesh to ignore the moral and material support she received from Hindu dominated India, Buddhist dominated Myanmar and Japan and Christian democracies of UK, France and Australia and communist countries like Russia and the then East Germany; iv) it would be in the interest of Bangladesh to develop better relations with the peoples of the neighbouring states; and v) it cannot be denied that except from the Mughal ruler Akbar Hindus did not receive proper treatment from the Muslim rulers. It may not be easy to establish absolutely amicable relationship among all the communities in South Asia because of the following constraints: (a) Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan; (b) Tamil uprising in Sri Lanka; (c) BJP-led DNA rule in India; and (d) Islamic fundamentalist dominated military rule in Pakistan. As Bangladesh appears to be free from any such constraints as quoted above it may be appropriate for her to initiate a proposal before coming SAARC summit for adopting resolutions aiming at eliminating any existing discriminatory policy (if there be any) and not to adopt any policy discriminating the minorities in future to improve communal relationship in the region. Though we may not get immediate result from such resolutions adoption of such resolutions would increase the confidence of the minorities and will make the SAARC more meaningful and powerful.

{"title": "Grab and slip", "body": "There is a human propensity for things coveted. The wise advice \"power lies in not using it\", is ignored, to pay covert allowances (baksheesh) generously for miscellaneous services rendered quietly, efficiently, and unofficially (the more informal the safer it is). When the rulers do not ride the rules, the regulations derail and rot and only deserve floating reference. Statutes (and lips) lie sealed inside the small print in the books of law. But today's shady (or scintillating) entrepreneurs bask in the publicity of the dining hall; away from the murky processing in the kitchen, and the proceedings in the pantry. The proof of the pudding lies not in the eating, but in ignoring the make-believe. A show is a show, and there is a time for dropping the curtain. All the world is not a stage - if the appropriation come stage by stage. The auditors are well treated here, provided they return the compliment. The inspectors are rather stiff-necked, and look straight ahead, because gentlemen do not poke their noses everywhere. Let them have some peace, is the official posture; and let the peaceful in the society lose their peace of mind for a while, for the sake of the country. The internal revolution continues; the RPM depending on the lubrication. Public duty may not be publicly visible, in the same way the fixation of responsibility in the civil service is invisible. Civil servants work quietly and anonymously in the background, betoken as a gesture of humility. But these days silence has its price in this noisy world; and the gas contracts are designed to leak through the back door. The society condones the concept of being economical with the truth; and the loud mouths get it out of the system through the gift of the gab. It is not a spectator sport, but the gladiators do go round in the arena, and the spectators have learnt to take it stoically. The inner space is pregnant with possibilities, but the live births are not celebrated in countries with the bottomless baskets. Professionalism, an old science, is a new art in the developing world, hence passing through the teething stage. A tight and rigid stance is not possible in the Third World - there are two more worlds to go up. A doctor is supposed to doctor the medicine; or is it otherwise? In the under-developed countries, the scanty resources for survival have to be engineered with an ingenuity which is supposed to be encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship. The auditors have to be rather philosophical at times. Frequently the spirit evaporates, and one is left high and dry. Efficiency comes in two models, dry and wet. The of the class, drenched in sweat, feed the dry, living higher up the mountain of labour. The leaders must be left undisturbed to think and plan. Defaulters also come in two models; one is the familiar bank-loan defaulter, and the other are those who default with the progress of the nation. The cerebral defaulters are entrusted to groom the country. The trust, however, is misplaced, and it causes instability on many fronts. Many rising nations are passing through this stage, and Bangladesh is no exception, except to note that the moral environment is deteriorating due to green envy. Grab, and slip away, with malice for none, and goodwill for all. This phase of the national itch is now in focus in the public fora. The battle for survival (for good and evil) is on. It is a classical battle of human choice.

{"title": "WB earns flak for AJM closure", "body": "Speakers at a dialogue yesterday came down heavily on the World Bank saying Adamjee Jute Mills was closed in line with a prescription of the bank. They said the Bank had earlier suggested halving annual production, which resulted in pushing up production cost. \"It was the World Bank that recommended to reduce the production to 50,000 tons annually from 99,000 tons which pushed the cost of Adamjee up,\" said Shahidullah Chowdhury, a trade union leader. The dialogue on 'Closure of the Adamjee Jute Mills and Future of Industrialisation in Bangladesh' was organised by the Centre for Studies in Social Transformation (CSST) at the Planning Academy in the city. Professor Sirajul Islam Chowdhury, president of CSST, chaired the session while Professor Abul Barkat of the Department of Economics of Dhaka University presented the keynote paper. Speaking at the dialogue, Professor Muzaffor Ahmed of the Institute of Business Administration noted wage issue did not link to the productivity for which industries in Bangladesh faced different problems. \"Bangladesh could not take the benefit of product diversification in the jute sector but some other countries are expanding their market by doing so,\" Prof Ahmed told the dialogue. Dr Kazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, president of Bangladesh Economic Association, said Adamjee was not only a company but also a strong pillar of jute industries. \"It is not a very good sign for a country that even cabinet ministers are not informed about many serious issues,\" he added. In his key-note presentation, Prof Barkat said World Bank's prescriptions are to down size the production capacity of jute mills and privatise and subsequently close down those units. \"It is very mysterious that World Bank is providing assistance to India for expanding its jute sector while it is providing a sunshine package for the jute sector in Bangladesh.\" M Ali Behrouze Ispahani, vice-chairman of Ispahani Group and immediate past president of Jute Mills Association, said three expert committees were constituted in three regimes to salvage the Adamjee Jute Mills (AJM). The first committee in 1978 by late president Zia, second in 1988 by former president Ershad and third one in 1998 by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but none of these committees suggested the closure of the AJM. Rather, these committees suggested re-organisation and modernisation of AJM, he said. Two sections of the AJM were highly profitable but all BJMC mills were incurring huge losses due to mismanagement and rampant corruption, Ispahani added. \"We should run the mills in a business-like manner and not as a political unit. It is a great shame that the mills in India and Pakistan are making huge profits whilst mills in Bangladesh are being closed down one by one,\" he mentioned. K R Hasan, former executive director of Adamjee, mentioned several examples of corruption in Adamjee and said a chief whip of the parliament asked him to manage Tk two lakh. Besides, the attitude of the national leaders in case of Adamjee was not in favour of Adamjee and it was one of the other reasons for closure of the largest jute mills, he said.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/news/wb-earns-flak-for-ajm-closure", "date": "2003-01-01T00:01:21+06:00", "language": "en", "source": "The Daily Star", "token_count": 511},

Last year's flood has swept over the low lying and shoal areas of the district. For this reason farmers of Sadar, Phulpur, Gafargaon and Dhubaura failed to avail of the chance to transplant 'Aman' seedlings in right-time. So the farmers have got a poor production of 'Aman' paddy which below their production cost. Even many farmers were not able to cultivate 'Aman' paddy as their seed-beds were damaged for washed away by the deluge. Lehaz Uddin, a farmer of shoal areas of sadar thana told this correspondent that he has harvested only seven mounds of paddy from 15 kathas of land where he harvested 21 mounds of 'Aman' paddy last year. He also informed that he would not be able to continue 'Boro' cultivation due to lack of sufficient capital.

State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin told BSS Monday that the cargo flight from the Shah Amanat International Airport (SAIA) will be formally inaugurated on January 18. Before the inauguration, a high powered meeting of senior officials and business community leaders will be held in the port to devise ways and means for smoother operation of the cargo flights and overcoming possible obstacles. Meanwhile, a 7-member Thai Cargo agents delegation based in Chiangmai arrived the port on Sunday on a four-day visit to have an on the spot assessment of the arrangement including infrastructures, security and other logistics as well as business prospects before dispatching of cargoes by air is initiated. Arthorm Dhamabutra, Manager (Cargo Mails & Sales) of the Thai Airways, is leading the delegation that comprised leading cargo operators and Thai Airways officials. The delegation has already visited the SAIA to see for themselves the infrastructure facilities for the cargo handling and held formal talks with the officials of Chittagong Customs House. They are scheduled to meet the leaders of trade circle to gather information about prospects and obstacles in this regard, delegation sources said. They also visited different export oriented factories particularly those in the garments and seafood sectors located in the city and in the Chittagong Export Processing Zone (CEPZ). Mohammad Ataullah, Manager (Cargo) of Thai Airways Bangladesh, who is accompanying the delegation, told BSS that the delegation has shown their keen interest in promoting business between Chiangmai and Chittagong through air cargo operation. He pointed out that the existing cargo terminal at SAIA is too small and there is hardly any noticeable security arrangement for the incoming or outgoing cargoes. \"It should have been done much earlier as there are huge possibilities of business,\" Ataullah said. The state of the art SAIA was built with the Japanese assistance, having a cargo terminal building of only 2700 sq meter area and a 312 sq meter cargo agents building, has no cargo warehouse, which is a must for keeping export-import cargoes safely for the time takes before and after delivery and documentation, airport sources said. Manager of SAIA Mohammad Khurshed Alam Sarker said preparations are on to make a good start for the cargo flight from here but what was needed is necessary skilled manpower, requisite equipment and policy guideline as the Civil Aviation Authority may be assigned to operate the cargo terminal instead of Bangladesh Biman which at present is handling the cargo village at ZIA. Official sources said Customs officials are already posted there and a counter of Sonali Bank also set up at the cargo terminal building for assessment of duties and help documentation of cargoes.
