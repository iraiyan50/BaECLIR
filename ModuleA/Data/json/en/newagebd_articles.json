{"title": "US sanctions on key Indian project in Iran take effect", "body": "US sanctions went into effect Monday on a major Indian port project in Iran, as president Donald Trump again showed his willingness to punish longstanding partner New Delhi in aid of his wider regional goals — in this case to pressure Tehran. The sanctions on the Chabahar port come a day after wide UN sanctions also came back into force on Iran, as Trump, European allies and Israel have all targeted the country over its nuclear program. The first Trump administration issued a rare exemption in 2018 to allow Indian companies to keep developing Chabahar when the United States imposed sweeping unilateral sanctions on Iran, whose main port at Bandar Abbas is overcapacity. But much has changed since 2018. Kabul was then still controlled by a government backed by Washington, the European Union and India, who viewed Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan with suspicion, accusing it of having ties to the Taliban. Chabahar had been billed as an alternate gateway to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan, which has long controlled the lion’s share of transit trade into Afghanistan. The Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021, as US forces withdrew under a peace deal signed by Trump. The US president has also broken with decades of US deference to India, in which his predecessors declined to press New Delhi on disagreements as they saw the rising power as a counterweight to China. Trump, who appeared peeved after Indian prime minister Narendra Modi declined to praise him over a ceasefire in a four-day conflict with Pakistan, has imposed major tariffs on India due to its purchases of oil from Russia. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott announced the end of the sanctions exemption on Chabahar in an earlier statement that said it was effective September 29. The decision is ‘consistent with President Trump’s maximum pressure policy to isolate the Iranian regime’ and the exemption had been made ‘for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance and economic development,’ Pigott said. Under US law, companies including state-run India Ports Global Limited will have 45 days to exit Chabahar or risk having any US-based assets frozen and US transactions barred. Joshua Kretman, a counsel at law firm Dentons who formerly worked on sanctions at the State Department, said any inclusion of an Indian firm on the sanctioned list ‘has the potential to create a kind of cascading effect where banks and other companies may not transact with the designated business.’ ‘If that sanctioned entity operates globally, needs access to major banks or dollar clearing, there is legitimate reason for concern,’ he said. Commenting on the decision, Indian foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said only: ‘We are presently examining the implications that this revocation has for India.’ Despite the closing of Afghanistan, India last year signed a 10-year contract in which the state-run India Ports Global Limited promised $370 million of investment in Chabahar. The port remains strategic for India as it lies near the border with longtime adversary Pakistan, in the troubled Baluchistan region. Barely 200 kilometres away on the Pakistani side, China is building a major port in Gwadar, which will give Beijing major new access into the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Chabahar ‘has strategic value for India: regional connectivity with Iran and Afghanistan and the Middle East without being held back’ by ‘friction with Pakistan,’ said Aparna Pande, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute. But India is always careful not to violate sanctions, she said. ‘At a time when there is an American administration which is imposing sanctions and tariffs as punitive action, India will likely adopt a wait-and-watch approach,’ she said. India begrudgingly stopped buying Iranian oil after Trump imposed sanctions in his first term. Nonetheless Kadira Pethiyagoda, a geopolitical strategist who has written on Indian foreign policy, said that India could use Iran ties as ‘leverage in its dealings with the US, Gulf states and Israel.’ ‘India may choose to wear the sanctions as part of a broader effort amongst non-Western Great Powers, including China and Russia, to reduce reliance on the US economy and decouple from Western-controlled financial networks,’ he said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/277619/us-sanctions-on-key-indian-project-in-iran-take-effect", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 677},

{"title": "Jr Tigers begin title defence in style", "body": "Bangladesh began their Under-19 Asia Cup title defence with a three-wicket win over their Afghanistan counterparts in the Group B opening match at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai on Saturday. After opting to bat first, Faisal Shinozada’s century guided Afghanistan to 283-7. Though Jawad Abrar missed his ton by four runs, Bangladesh successfully reached 284-7 with seven balls in hand, their highest ever run chase. Chasing the target, openers Jawad and Rifat Beg made a strong start as they posted 76 runs in the first powerplay and reached the 100-mark in just 14.2 overs. The duo formed a 151-run opening stand as Roohullah Arab gave Afghanistan a late breakthrough when Rifat was dismissed for 62 off 68. Jawad was next to go for 96, consisting of nine fours and six sixes, becoming the second victim of Arab. Soon after his dismissal, the boundaries dried up, and then skipper Azizul Hakim and Kalam Siddiki stitched a 66-run partnership. Kalam Siddiki (29) fell to another sharp catch, and Azizul was bowled for 47 off 48 with two fours and three sixes. Bangladesh lost two more wickets in the 46th over, when wicket-keeper batter Md Abdullah (two) and Samiun Bashir (one) were run out amid mounting pressure. However, all-rounder Rizan Hossan remained calm and completed their chase with an unbeaten 17 off 13, while Sheikh Parvez Jibon scored 13 for the defending champions. Apart from Arab’s 2-48, Stanikzai picked up 2-46 for the Afghans. Earlier, Afghans stuttered early, but a fine recovery from the middle order led by Osman Sadat and Faisal steadied the innings. Faisal added 66 runs with Osman, who contributed 34 runs before being dismissed in the 19th over. Uzairullah Niazai then partnered with Faisal and added 93 runs off just 83 balls for the third wicket. Faisal fell to pacer Iqbal Hossain Emon soon after reaching his ton. Faisal smashed eight fours and four sixes to play his 94-ball 103 innings. Skipper Mahboob Khan got a start but failed to convert it into a big score. Niazai fell six runs short of his fifty, but a late cameo from Abdul Aziz, who remained not out on 26, took them over the 280-run mark. Azizullah Miakhil remained not out on 38. Shahriar Ahmed (2-63) and Iqbal picked up (2-43) two wickets each, while Saad Islam, Samium Basir and Rizan all took a wicket each.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/285141/jr-tigers-begin-title-defence-in-style", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 395},

With the latest arrests on Monday, the number of arrestees in connection with the attacks has risen to 28. The police had earlier arrested 17 people in connection with the attacks following the death of the Inquilab Mancha convener and a July uprising organiser, Sharif Osman Hadi, at a hospital in Singapore. A Dhaka Metropolitan Police press release issued on Tuesday said that the metropolitan police’s Detective Branch arrested nine people from different parts of the capital on Monday and two other people were arrested by Tejgaon police on the day. The arrestees are Abdur Rahman, 30, Md Jannatul Naim, 21, Md Faisal, 24, Kari Muaz Bin Abdul Rahman, 33, Jubaer Hossain, 21, Md Almas Ali, 29, Zulfiqur Ali Sourav, 22, Niaz Mahmud, 28, Mohammad Mainul Islam, 22, Md Hashem, 26 and Arafat Yasmin, 29.

On Monday, the authorities of the Prothom Alo and The Daily Star filed separate cases with the Tejgaon police station over the December 18 vandalism and arson on their offices. The Prothom Alo filed a case against 400-500 unnamed people and The Daily Star filed another case against 350-400 unnamed people in connection with the vandalism, looting and arson on their offices. The authorities of the Prothom Alo said that they had incurred a loss of Tk 32 crore and The Daily Star authorities said they had suffered a loss of Tk 40 crore, according to separate case documents. United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Irene Khan on Tuesday said that the violent mob attacks on media outlets and cultural institutions in Bangladesh were deeply alarming and must be promptly and effectively investigated, with perpetrators brought to justice without delay. In a statement to the media, she condemned the attacks on the night of December 18, when hundreds of people vandalised media houses at Karwanbazar in Dhaka and targeted cultural institutions following the death of Inquilab Mancha convener Sharif Osman Hadi. On Tuesday, French ambassador Jean-Marc Séré-Charlet and the German Embassy’s Chargé d’Affaires Anja Kersten visited Prothom Alo and The Daily Star offices following the recent incident, expressing their solidarity with the journalists and the steadfast support of France and Germany for press freedom, according to a Facebook post of the German Embassy in Dhaka. On the night of December 18, hundreds of attackers vandalised and looted the offices of the Prothom Alo in the capital’s Karwanbazar area and The Daily Star on Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, and then set fire to the offices.

{"title": "Iran’s carpet industry unravelling under sanctions", "body": "Once a symbol of cultural prestige, Iran’s handmade rugs are no longer selling as fast as they once did, as sanctions weigh on an already troubled economy and buyers’ tastes change. Commanding more than $2 billion in export revenues in its heyday of the early 1990s, the industry now struggles to scrape together around $40 million, marking a dramatic collapse of more than 95 per cent. The reimposition of sanctions in 2018 meant the age-old craft lost what was traditionally its largest market — the United States. ‘In the years when the unkind and cruel US sanctions on the hand-woven carpet sector were imposed... we lost the US, the buyer of more than 70 per cent of Iranian hand-woven carpets,’ Zahra Kamani, head of Iran’s National Carpet Centre, told state TV. In 2017, just before the sanctions were revived, rugs were still considered one of the country’s key non-oil exports, with a revenue of more than $400 million. But Iran’s customs organisation said that during the last year of the Persian calendar that ended in March, exports stood at just $41.7 million. Exports went to 55 countries that year, topped by Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Japan and China. In the interim, competitors such as India, China, Nepal and Pakistan have seized the opportunity, seeking to fill the gap in the global market. Some of those rugs even make their way to Iran, where, according to Kamani, at least two million people, including women in rural areas, depend on the carpet-weaving industry for their livelihood — sometimes earning as little as a few dollars a day. Carpet trader Hamed Nabizadeh told AFP that ‘Iran is importing carpets from other countries, such as India, Turkey and China. We are losing a part of our domestic sales volume in the Iranian market due to these imports’. For decades, Western tourists would pass through Iran, picking up rugs as souvenirs or gifts. But with the country’s tourism industry also hit by travel warnings and hostile relations, fewer foreigners are visiting, translating to fewer rug sales. Nabizadeh moreover says that even the tourists who come ‘might not be interested in our work as consumer tastes have changed’ and ‘the price tags are quite high’. ‘It is somewhat difficult for even someone living in a European country to buy a silk carpet for, say, $30,000 to $40,000. The transportation of the carpet is also quite challenging for tourists,’ he added. Experts attribute the market slump to a tangle of economic and political factors. Broad international sanctions have cut off vital markets, while flawed domestic currency and foreign-exchange policies — especially those restricting repatriation of export revenues — have crippled competitiveness. Compounding the issue, rising production costs and weak government support have squeezed the industry. Iranian officials insist that the revival of the industry and the art of carpet-weaving, which dates back to the Bronze Age of Persia, is possible. ‘We have lost some international markets, but we hope that with the country’s trade and currency laws we can resuscitate this industry,’ trade minister Mohammad Atabak was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA in June. ‘We are trying to promote and facilitate exports for the country’s merchants with newly signed agreements,’ he added. For Nabizadeh, the way out of this crisis is to pay more attention to ‘current trends in decoration’. ‘We should produce carpets based on those trends and not be too prejudiced that the carpet must have the same old shapes and patterns.’ He cited ‘attracting online customers through social media’ and ‘creating strong branding for carpets’ as other possible solutions. But with the collapse of the national currency against the dollar, even the domestic market is at risk of evaporating. ‘Even though I always wanted handwoven carpets for my dowry and my family had promised me that, they couldn’t afford them. Instead, we opted for factory-made ones,’ said Shima, a 31-year-old bride-to-be. ‘It is an age-old marriage tradition that the bride should provide the carpets of the house,’ said Shima, who did not wish to provide her full name to maintain her privacy. ‘However, many families are choosing factory-made rugs these days because of their lower prices or do not buy carpets altogether if they are of the more needy classes.’ Now, with Iran increasingly losing domestic customers and global markets dominated by lower-cost imitations, the Persian rug risks becoming a relic of a lost golden age, with its legacy hanging by a thread.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/277052/irans-carpet-industry-unravelling-under-sanctions", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 743},

The report, prepared by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and published on Wednesday, details the experiences of the Rohingya refugees who have also offered recommendations to achieve a sustainable future. The new publication titled ‘Report on Rohingya Perspectives on Pathways to a Safe, Dignified, and Peaceful Future: Voices from the Refugee Camps’ reflects the perspectives within the Rohingya refugee community in Cox’s Bazar across age, gender and arrival year. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were held with 125 participants from the community, said a press release sent by the UN Resident Coordinator’s Office in Bangladesh on the day. As per the report, since late 2023, over 1,50,000 Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh due to conflicts in Rakhine State, adding to over one million refugees already in the camps. As immediate priorities in the camps—56 per cent interviewees raised urgent need to stop violence from armed and criminal groups and 50 per cent raised importance of education, especially for youths, as key to regaining dignity and future leadership. They also pointed out the issues of insufficient access to food, healthcare and shelter and demanded earning opportunities to reduce dependency on aid and concrete steps towards safe return with rights. One of the key findings of the report is an overwhelming desire for repatriation making return to Myanmar their ultimate goal. The current obstacles for return were marked as conflict between Arakan Army and Myanmar military, while 95 per cent of the participants said that elections under the junta brought no hope for safe future. According to another key finding, all respondents across age and gender considered safe living under Arakan Army control was impossible. The report made eight key recommendations, including the United League of Arakan /Arakan Army must comply with international law, its actions towards the Rohingyas must be monitored, United League of Arakan /Arakan Army must invest in confidence building measures identified by the Rohingyas, civil society and youth led networks in the Rohingya refugee camps must be elevated, international community, relevant member states, including regional powers, must leverage all diplomatic pathways effectively to exert pressure for inclusive political dialogue, and sanctions must be expanded and enforced against the junta.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/277060/rohingyas-keen-on-safe-return-to-myanmar-ohchr-report", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 390},

{"title": "‘Inequality crisis’ threatens democracy, experts warn G20", "body": "Wealth inequality is a global emergency that threatens democracy and social cohesion, experts warned Tuesday, urging G20 leaders meeting in South Africa this month to establish a panel to tackle the crisis. The ‘inequality emergency’ is leaving billions hungry and could worsen under the United States’ ‘law of the jungle’ approach to trade under president Donald Trump, a committee led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said in a new report. The proposed panel on inequality was inspired by the UN’s expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that analyses the risks and impact of global warming and proposes solutions. ‘One in four people worldwide now regularly skip meals, whilst billionaire wealth has now hit the highest level in history,’ said the report, which was commissioned for the Johannesburg summit of the world’s top economies in the Group of 20. Between 2000 and 2024, one per cent of the world’s population captured 41 per cent of all new wealth, of which just one per cent went to the poorest 50 per cent, it said. While income inequality between individuals declined in recent decades, largely due to economic development in China, there had been a major increase in inherited wealth, with $70 trillion expected to be handed down to heirs in the coming 10 years, it said. ‘The world understands that we have a climate emergency; it’s time we recognise that we face an inequality emergency too,’ Stiglitz said in a statement. ‘It isn’t just unfair and undermining societal cohesion — it’s a problem for our economy and our politics too,’ he said. The report warned that US policies, including the imposition of tariffs on trading partners, risked increasing inequality. ‘This new world, in which the powerful break rules with impunity and we move away from a rules-based international order towards a ‘law of the jungle’, could entrench unequal exchange, investment and technology patterns,’ it said. The report — commissioned by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, whose own country one of the most unequal in the world, based on World Bank calculations — said economic inequality undermined democracy and led to increasing authoritarianism. ‘Inequality erodes trust in institutions, fuels political polarisation, can reduce participation among poorer citizens and residents, and creates social tensions of different kinds,’ it said. More than 80 per cent of countries experienced ‘high inequality’, based on the World Bank definition, and these nations were seven times more likely to experience democratic decline. The six-person committee said the proposed International Panel on Inequality would analyse all aspects of inequality — from land ownership to tax avoidance — and inform policymaking. Measures to tackle the problem included fair taxation of multinational corporations and the very wealthy, breaking up monopolies, stabilising prices and restructuring the debt of highly indebted countries. South Africa is the first African nation to hold the presidency of the G20 grouping of 19 countries, alongside the African Union and the European Union. Together they represent 85 per cent of global GDP, 75 per cent of international trade and two-thirds of the world’s population. Trump has indicated that he would not attend the November 22-23 summit. Stiglitz told reporters he did not expect Washington, the next G20 president, to back the proposal for an equality panel but ‘hopefully a majority of countries would eventually join in’. Ramaphosa said the report was ‘a blueprint for greater equality’, which South Africa wanted to put on the international agenda through its G20 presidency. ‘Addressing inequality is our inescapable generational challenge. This report lays out prudent and pragmatic steps we can take to reduce it,’ he said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/281219/inequality-crisis-threatens-democracy-experts-warn-g20", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 598},

It said the tanker sustained only ‘minor damage’ on the starboard side and that none of the 20-strong crew was hurt. On Friday evening, Turkey’s transport ministry said two empty oil tankers, the Virat and the Kairos, had reported explosions but sustained no casualties, saying they had been struck in Turkish waters but without saying what had caused the blasts. The ministry’s post was the first official confirmation that the Virat was attacked by drones. Turkey said the Kairos was en route to the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk where a major Russian oil terminal halted operation early on Saturday after being hit by a naval drone attack, the consortium that owns the terminal said. The terminal, part of which sustained ‘significant damage’, is a major conduit for Kazakh oil, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium said, without saying who was responsible for the attack. Ukraine, which regularly targets Russian energy facilities in a bid to sap the country’s war chest, did not immediately comment. The blast struck the Kairos at around 1500 GMT on Friday, with rescuers evacuating its 25 crew members after a fire broke out. At the time, it was about 100 kilometres east of the point where the Bosphorus Strait enters the Black Sea, officials said. The Virat was struck later. At the time, it was about 400 kilometres further east, according to the VesselFinder tracking site. Transport minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said both had suffered ‘explosions’, telling private NTV television late Friday the tankers might have been hit a mine, or been struck by a rocket or a drone. ‘An external impact means the vessel was hit by a mine, a rocket, or a similar projectile, or perhaps by a drone, or by an unmanned underwater vehicle. These are the first things that come to mind,’ he said. In a post on X, the maritime affairs directorate said the Kairos was ‘en route to Russia’s Novorossiysk’ when it reported an ‘external impact causing a fire 28 nautical miles off’ the Turkish coast. It posted dramatic images of flames and thick black smoke pouring out of the vessel, with the blaze still raging some five hours later. The directorate later said the Virat had reported ‘being hit approximately 35 nautical miles offshore’, adding that all 20 crew were unharmed but there was ‘heavy smoke detected in the engine room’, although those on board had not requested evacuation. Both tankers—which are flying a Gambian flag, according to the VesselFinder website—are subject to Western sanctions for transporting oil from Russian ports in defiance of an embargo imposed after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, both sides have planted sea mines to protect their coastlines. Many have since been located and destroyed in the Black Sea, but others have drifted, notably due to storms, endangering shipping. In response, NATO members Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania—all of whom border the Black Sea—set up the Mine Countermeasures Naval Group in 2024 to oversee de-mining operations.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/283644/blast-hit-black-sea-tanker-struck-again-turkey", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 563},

{"title": "San Siro on course for demolition after sale to Inter and Milan approved", "body": "One of the world's most famous stadiums is set for demolition after Milan city hall early Tuesday approved the sale of San Siro, nicknamed football's La Scala, to the city's two football giants. Inter and AC Milan had both threatened to abandon the city had the sale not been approved after having looked at sites in nearby suburbs. More than 11 hours of debate at city hall ended with 24 votes in favour of the sale for 197 million euros ($231 million) and 20 against -- enough for Italy's economic capital to decree that Inter Milan and AC Milan will become owners of both the iconic stadium and adjacent land. Confirmation of a vote in favour of the resolution didn't come until nearly 4:00am (0200 GMT) after a long night which included discussion of a raft of proposed amendments. In the end Inter and AC Milan, both owned by US investment funds, and the mayor of Italy's economic capital Giuseppe Sala got what they wanted after years of uncertainty over a 1.2-billion-euro project. The clubs proposed purchasing the site in March after a previous project in which the land remained public was abandoned in 2023. In a statement, Inter and AC Milan called the vote ‘a historic and decisive step for the future of the clubs and the city’. ‘The clubs look ahead with confidence and responsibility to the next steps of the process that will lead to the creation of a new stadium meeting the highest international standards.’ As long as the sale is completed by November 10 -- when a public building protection order preventing the demolition of the San Siro comes into effect -- Inter and AC Milan will take control of just over 28 hectares (70 acres) of public land in a densely populated area on the western outskirts of Milan. It is on the land to the immediate west of the San Siro, currently occupied by matchday car parking and a local park, where a modern 71,500-capacity arena will be built. Once the new ground is constructed, San Siro will be almost entirely demolished to make way for new parkland, office space and entertainment facilities with everything to be designed by architectural firms Foster and Partners and MANICA. It will still be some years before the bulldozers come for the current San Siro, where Inter and AC Milan will continue to play their matches to crowds of up to 75,000 until 2031 when the clubs hope to have the new stadium finished. The clubs and Sala were helped by the abstention of councillors from the right-wing Forza Italian party founded by deceased former prime minister and ex-AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi. The other opposition parties, the hard-right League and Brothers of Italy, both voted against the proposal, as did a number of councillors from the left-leaning majority which backs Sala's local government. There has been anger across the political spectrum in Milan at what councillors see as a bypassing of local democracy with Sala trying to avoid being the mayor who allowed two of the world's biggest football clubs to leave Milan. The proposal was criticised by some members of the council for not containing any details of the development of the new stadium and surrounding area, while the price was also blasted as being too low for a prime area of real estate. The vote will please Italy's football federation (FIGC) as Milan is one of the potential candidates to hold matches at Euro 2032, which is set to be jointly hosted by Italy and Turkey. The FIGC needs to communicate to UEFA its five official picks for stadiums for the tournament by October next year, when it can present new venues or ones which need to be redeveloped as long as works begin by March 2027. Only one of Italy's 14 potential candidates -- Juventus' Allianz Stadium in Turin -- is currently in line with the criteria set by European football's governing body.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/277595/san-siro-on-course-for-demolition-after-sale-to-inter-and-milan-approved", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 660},
{"title": "Nationwide law-order drive ahead of polls", "body": "The interim government decided to prepare a list of extortionists across the country and launch a nationwide coordinated drive comprising five state agencies to combat extortion ahead of the upcoming general elections. The drive will also be addressed to other crimes, including mugging and robbery, and to strengthen surveillance and security to prevent any deterioration of the law and order ahead of the elections. The decisions were taken at the 14th meeting of the Law and Order Advisory Council on September 21 with home adviser retired Lieutenant General Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury in the chair. The Home Ministry on Thursday sent the meeting minutes to the related offices, including that of the cabinet secretary, related ministries, police headquarters, all police commissioners, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, and superintendents of police. After the meeting, adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said, ‘We discussed conducting nationwide drives by law enforcement agencies to curb mugging and extortion.’ The discussions also covered security measures for Durga Puja and maintaining the law and order before the next general elections, he said. According to a decision, a complete list of extortionists across the country will be prepared and they will be swiftly brought under the law to ensure exemplary punishment. The five agencies that have been given the responsibilities of making the list and carrying out the drive are the Police, the National Security Intelligence, the Rapid Action Battalion, the Special Branch of the police, and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence. Instructions will also be given to the law enforcement agencies to take strict legal actions against those accused of mugging, robbery, and extortion. In ensuring election security, it was decided, all relevant agencies must work in coordination to develop a clear action plan to hold a free, fair, and impartial election. Any individual or group attempting to create any unrest must be identified and brought under the law and strict actions must be taken against them. In the field, deputy commissioners, police supers, upazila nirbahi officers, and police station officers-in-charge must carry out their duties impartially to ensure a smooth election, the meeting stressed. It also decided that CCTV cameras will be installed at all vulnerable polling stations while effective monitoring systems must be put in place to ensure safety and security. The meeting also decided that those who had held responsibilities in the 2014, 2018, and 2024 parliamentary elections should, as far as possible, not be assigned duties in the next national elections. Social media surveillance will be stepped up to counter disinformation and hate campaigns targeting law enforcement or election officials. During both the pre-election and election periods, all agencies must work together impartially to manage situations effectively, it also decided. Ansar and VDP personnel, the meeting decided, will be deployed for nine days at the Puja venues From September 24 to October 2. Vulnerable temples and mandaps will have round-the-clock security, with volunteers assigned for monitoring in coordination with local administrations, while the Armed Forces, police, BGB, RAB and Coast Guard will conduct visible patrols nationwide. Committees involving local communities will be formed to safeguard communal harmony while strict action will be taken against rumour-mongers spreading sectarian unrest online. The law and order meeting also decided to take necessary measures to ensure that individuals involved with banned organisations or parties and pro-fascist activities do not get bail in courts. By reviewing the cases of such individuals, a four-member committee with the joint secretary (Political-2) as its convener must be assigned to carry out its activities in this regard properly. Constant vigilance must be maintained against the masterminds of banned organisations or parties and fascist activities, and intelligence surveillance must be intensified. The cases filed in connection with the Students Against Discrimination movement during the 2024 July mass uprising must be properly reviewed. Special attention must be paid to ensure that no one is harassed because of any false cases. The meeting also decided that the security of the families of the martyrs and the injured in the July movement must be ensured, as threats, intimidation, and even death threats were being issued to members of such families through social media. Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that no untoward situation arises over the Rajshahi University Central Students’ Union and hall union elections. The meeting also ordered intensified drives against narcotics, particularly ketamine and Yaba pills entering through the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Surveillance will be heightened at Teknaf and along the coastal areas to prevent smuggling of drugs and other contraband materials, while a decision was also taken for recovering illegal firearms. The meeting also decided that other strong measures would be taken in the garment and industrial sectors to prevent labour unrest and ensure timely payment of worker wages as well as enhanced vigilance in the Chittagong Hill Tracts to stop extortion and insurgency.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/277260/nationwide-law-order-drive-ahead-of-polls", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 799},

{"title": "A dangerous turn for press freedom", "body": "THE Maldivian parliament has recently passed a new Media and Broadcasting Regulation Bill that threatens to fundamentally erode press freedom in the archipelago. The legislation, presented by MP Abdul Hannan Aboobakuru and rapidly fast-tracked through the People’s Majlis, would dissolve existing regulatory bodies — the Maldives Media Council and the Maldives Broadcasting Commission (BroadCom) — and replace them with a new Maldives Media and Broadcasting Commission. Critics warn that this new body would be stacked with presidential appointees, empowered to fine, suspend, or shutter outlets, block websites, and retroactively investigate media actions. The law will reverse decades of hard-won progress. Journalists in the Maldives, who have often operated under fragile protections, now fear an environment of state-sanctioned censorship. For a country that has styled itself as a rising democracy and a tourism powerhouse, the bill signals a worrying slide back into authoritarian control. The anatomy of the bill AT FIRST glance, the bill might appear to be a technical restructuring of media regulation. In reality, it is a dramatic centralisation of power. The new Maldives Media and Broadcasting Commission would consist of seven members, three of whom—including the Chairperson — would be appointed directly by the president. The remaining four are to be elected by media outlets, but the law disqualifies outlets less than five years old from voting. This clause, seemingly minor, effectively excludes many of the most dynamic online outlets, which have grown rapidly in the past few years. The commission’s powers are sweeping. It can impose heavy fines — ranging from about USD 325 to USD 6,490 depending on the severity of violations — on journalists and media outlets. It can suspend registrations, block websites, and halt broadcasting during investigations, even before any finding of wrongdoing. Worse still, it permits investigations into actions taken up to a year before the bill becomes law, introducing the spectre of retroactive punishment. Journalists warn that these provisions amount to a weaponisation of regulation. Rather than upholding professional standards, the MMBC would serve as a political tool, discouraging critical coverage and rewarding compliant outlets. Why the bill is repressive THE bill undermines journalistic independence at every level. Although four members are to be elected by media outlets, the presidential control over three key seats, including the chairperson, gives the executive disproportionate influence. The possibility of removing elected members through parliamentary no-confidence votes further reduces autonomy. The language of the bill is deliberately vague. Offences such as ‘non-compliance with codes of conduct’ or ‘disrupting public order’ can be interpreted broadly, enabling regulators to penalise almost any form of critical reporting. International watchdogs, including the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists, warn that such ambiguity invites abuse. The disenfranchisement of outlets under five years old compounds the problem. In a digital era where independent blogs, podcasts, and news platforms are often the most agile voices of accountability, the bill deliberately sidelines them. The effect is to privilege older, often more politically connected outlets, while strangling emerging ones. Most concerning is the provision to suspend or block media pending investigations. This undermines the principle of due process. A mere allegation could shutter an outlet, crippling its operations regardless of whether wrongdoing is ultimately proven. In effect, regulation becomes censorship by proxy. A history of fragile press freedom TO UNDERSTAND the gravity of this bill, one must place it in historical context. Press freedom in the Maldives has long been fragile. Under president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom (1978–2008), censorship was rampant, with only a handful of state-aligned outlets permitted to operate. Journalists faced harassment, imprisonment, and exile. The democratic transition of 2008, with Mohamed Nasheed’s election, briefly opened space for independent media. New outlets emerged, investigative journalism flourished, and citizens experienced freer access to information. Yet these gains were short-lived. The ouster of Nasheed in 2012 and the presidency of Abdulla Yameen (2013–2018) ushered in a crackdown. Journalists were assaulted, the country’s only newspaper with an opposition tilt was pressured, and the death of blogger Yameen Rasheed in 2017 underscored the risks of dissent. Since then, Maldives’ press has oscillated between fragile openness and creeping control. President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih (2018–2023) pledged reforms and passed a landmark right-to-information law, but implementation lagged. The return of an assertive executive under president Mohamed Muizzu has reignited fears of institutionalised repression. The new bill crystallises those fears into law. Implications for democracy, public interest, and free expression THE consequences of this bill are not confined to journalists. They ripple across the Maldives’ entire democratic fabric. First, the bill weakens the media’s role as a watchdog. Independent journalism has historically been critical in exposing corruption, from shady infrastructure deals to tourism sector mismanagement. Curtailing the press reduces the incentive for government officials and businesses to act transparently. Second, the bill entrenches self-censorship. Journalists, fearing fines or closure, are more likely to avoid politically sensitive stories, leaving citizens uninformed about issues of public interest. Third, the bill undermines Maldives’ international credibility. As a small island nation heavily dependent on tourism, Maldives sells itself to the world as a safe, open, democratic destination. Attacks on press freedom contradict that narrative, potentially discouraging investment and inviting international criticism. Fourth, the bill damages pluralism. By excluding younger outlets, it stifles the diversity of voices, perspectives, and languages that make up the country’s vibrant media landscape. For young Maldivians, particularly those accessing news online, this means fewer independent sources of information and a narrowing of democratic space. Comparative regional lessons MALDIVES is not alone in this trend. Across South Asia, governments have sought to muzzle the press under the guise of regulation. In Sri Lanka, the government has used the Prevention of Terrorism Act to target journalists. In Bangladesh, the Digital Security Act has been widely criticised for criminalising online expression. In India, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has applied financial and legal pressure on independent media houses. These cases demonstrate how authoritarian control often begins with regulatory restructuring. By couching restrictions in the language of accountability and professional standards, governments can justify repression as reform. Maldives’ bill fits neatly into this regional pattern, signalling a worrying alignment with illiberal governance models rather than democratic norms. Defending media freedom: what must be done THE first line of defence must come from within. Journalists, editors, and civil society must continue to speak out against the bill. The Maldives Journalists Association has already issued strong statements condemning the proposal and calling for its withdrawal. Public protests, open letters, and petitions help maintain visibility and mobilise citizens. Elements of the bill are ripe for constitutional challenge. Retroactive punishment violates basic legal principles, while suspension without due process undermines constitutional protections for free expression. The judiciary must act independently and decisively to defend those rights. Global pressure matters. The European Union, United Nations, and Commonwealth have long supported Maldives’ democratic transition. They must now remind the government that continued repression jeopardises international partnerships. Targeted diplomatic pressure — such as linking aid or cooperation to human rights standards — can raise the political cost of passing such a bill. International journalist organisations, including CPJ and IFJ, should continue to highlight Maldives’ case as emblematic of the global struggle for press freedom in small states. Importantly, Maldives does need strong media regulation. Fake news, disinformation, and online harassment are real challenges. But regulation should be independent, transparent, and protective of rights. Instead of creating an executive-controlled body, Maldives could strengthen self-regulation, encourage peer review, and invest in media literacy campaigns. These measures address legitimate concerns without eroding freedom. A broader democratic test THE media control bill is not just about journalism; it is about the direction of Maldivian democracy itself. In a region marked by democratic backsliding, Maldives risks joining the ranks of countries where civic space is shrinking, dissent is stifled, and authoritarian tendencies grow unchecked. The irony is stark: Maldives, whose survival depends on international goodwill to tackle climate change and support sustainable tourism, is undermining its own democratic reputation. Investors, tourists, and partners are unlikely to trust a country that silences its own citizens. The proposed Maldives Media and Broadcasting Regulation Bill represents a serious threat to media freedom and democratic norms. Its structure gives excessive control to the executive, imposes vague sanctions, and threatens to silence dissent. Media regulation is legitimate and sometimes necessary, but it must be independent, transparent, and rights-protective. This bill is none of those things. It is a thinly veiled attempt at consolidating executive control, reducing pluralism, and weakening accountability. Press freedom is not a luxury. It is the foundation of democratic accountability, economic credibility, and social trust. Maldivians deserve more than a silenced press — they deserve a media that speaks truth to power, without fear of penalty or closure.

{"title": "East Ukraine stronghold evacuates families as Russia nears", "body": "When authorities ordered the evacuation of families and children from parts of Kramatorsk in east Ukraine, 34-year-old mother of two Angela Bolonz was initially shocked. The city in the eastern Donetsk region has been a symbol of Ukrainian resistance for over a decade, battling a brief takeover by pro-Russia separatists in 2014 and resisting capture since Russia invaded in 2022. But with Moscow advancing to less than 20 kilometres from Kramatorsk and launching regular drone attacks, residents like Angela are grappling with the once unthinkable: that their city — like so many others in the east — could become unliveable. ‘When the evacuation was announced, people started leaving,’ Angela said in a quiet voice, fixing her eyes on a heap of plastic bags filled with her possessions. Russia controls almost 80 per cent of the Donetsk region and has been inching towards the city for months, hoping to take it over and sweep through Ukraine’s vast plains. Angela — together with her daughters aged five and 10 — decided to evacuate after Russia started flying explosive drones near their home, some of which set fire to cars. On October 5, one drone guided by a thread of optical fibre several-dozen-kilometres-long struck a vehicle in the centre of Kramatorsk, a first for the city. While the streets in the centre of Kramatorsk were calm, tensions on its outskirts were palpable. On the road to Druzhkivka, a town about ten kilometres to the south of Kramatorsk, cars sped under the cover of anti-drone netting. Stopping en route can be fatal. At the side of the road, soldiers were busy trying to fix an armoured vehicle whose bumper had been blown off by a drone. Meanwhile, at a treatment centre for wounded soldiers, medics struggled to tend to all the patients. With his pants around his ankles, a tall man let out a volley of curses and jokes to lighten the mood as a doctor removed a piece of shrapnel from his bloodied buttock. Next to him, Yuriy, lying under a survival blanket, forced a smile. ‘We were returning from our position when an FPV hit us. Like everywhere, it’s tough. Very tough,’ he said. Sergiy, a 34-year-old doctor, said the vast majority of injuries were from FPVs — first-person-view drones. ‘One guy had a leg wound that completely necrotised,’ he said, puffing on a cigarette. As the range of the drones increases, the front line has become more like a strip — an area that some Ukrainians call the ‘lethal zone’ — about 20 kilometres wide. Russia has intensified its drone attacks ahead of winter, when the batteries on the drones will be colder and not as effective. According to one soldier in the area who wished to remain anonymous, rotating troops has become even more dangerous than having them stay in the combat zone. Troop rotations are now only carried out on foot, in ten-kilometre segments, while soldiers wear special cover to evade the drones’ thermal imaging cameras. Russian saboteurs, disguised as Ukrainian soldiers or civilians, have also strayed beyond the front line to set up booby traps, further blurring the line between civilian areas and the battlefield. ‘It’s discouraging when you’re fired upon by Russians while trying to reach your position,’ the soldier said. As Russia continues its advances, Sloviansk, another major stronghold in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, also called on vulnerable residents to evacuate. Angela left behind her mother, her older brother, and her mother-in-law, who refused to leave the home. She will join her sister in Zaporizhzhia, a southern city that came under Russian bombardment that same night.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/278917/east-ukraine-stronghold-evacuates-families-as-russia-nears", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 600},

It did not offer any other firm conclusions or apportion blame for the disaster. It emerged last month that the father of one of the pilots has asked India’s top court for an independent investigation, arguing the official probe was unfairly blaming the crew. In the interviews, which included several to British broadcasters, Ramesh was reluctant to talk about the crash, saying it was still ‘very painful’. ‘I get flashbacks all the time. I just stay awake, I sleep maybe three to four hours,’ he told PA. Ramesh told the BBC he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy. ‘When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,’ he added. His advisers told the British broadcaster he was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but that he has not received any medical treatment since being back in the UK.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/281037/sole-survivor-of-air-india-crash-has-painful-memories", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 345},
{"title": "Students withdraw hunger strike", "body": "The students who are in the process of admission to the proposed Dhaka Central University in the 2024-2025 academic session withdrew their indefinite hunger strike at about 8:00pm on Thursday, about 34 hours after they began it. They began the strike at about 10:00am on Wednesday at the entrance of Dhaka College, demanding immediate completion of their admission and beginning of their classes. They demanded that the authorities issue a notice by November 6 announcing that the rest of their admission process must begin on November 9. The protesters also demanded that the notice must announce the exact date of the beginning of their classes. One of the protesters, Abu Bakar Saddik, said in the evening that they withdrew their demonstration as the university administrator assured them of meeting their demands after a meeting with the education adviser on November 6. Earlier in the afternoon, he said that their admission process was yet to be completed, though the time of admission for the next year, 2025-26, is knocking at the door. Groups of students, including those from Dhaka College and Eden Mohila College, came and expressed solidarity with the protest on Wednesday and Thursday. Two of the protesters were sent to hospital on Thursday as they fell sick during the hunger strike. Meanwhile, leaders of the Dhaka College unit of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, Jatiya Chhatra Shakti, Samajtantrik Chhatra Front and Chhatra Odhikar Parishad came to the spot and expressed their solidarity with the protesters. The protesters’ admission test was held in August and the authorities postponed the dates scheduled for completing their admission twice. The authorities, for the last time, on October 26, shifted the dates of completing their admission to November 16–December 1. Over 10,000 students were primarily admitted to the proposed university, according to the proposed university’s interim administration administrator Professor Elias, also the principal of Dhaka College. The government is yet to finalise the ordinance of the proposed university. On September 24, the government published a draft of the Dhaka Central University Ordinance 2025 to establish the university with seven government colleges amid student protests. The seven colleges—Dhaka College, Begum Badrunnesa Government Women’s College, Eden Mohila College, Government Bangla College, Government Shaheed Suhrawardy College, Government Titumir College and Kabi Nazrul Government College—were affiliated to Dhaka University in 2017 before which they were under National University. A section of teachers and students of the colleges in different groups, however, opposed the structure of the proposed university since the publication of the draft ordinance. Another section of students staged demonstrations demanding the immediate issuance of the ordinance.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/280676/students-withdraw-hunger-strike", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 428},
{"title": "Judiciary must in no way be shackled to executive", "body": "A FUNCTIONAL independence of the judiciary should mean a judiciary independent of the legislative and the executive branch in all aspects. But this has not happened all these years. The independence of the judiciary was officially effected on November 1, 2007 from the executive and the legislative based on a 12-point directive that the Appellate Division issued on December 2, 1999. But the independence of the judiciary has continued to be questioned in its functioning because of a dual control by the law ministry and the Supreme Court. The interim government, installed on August 8, 2024, has amended several laws to improve access to justice and the justice delivery system. The government on October 23 also in principle approved the draft of the Supreme Court Secretariat Ordinance 2025 after the High Court on September 2 ordered the government to establish a separate secretariat of the Supreme Court in three months after vesting the apex court with full disciplinary control over subordinate judges. But the proposition has now run into a couple of problems, with legal experts fearing a further delay as the executive appears opposed to the separation of the judiciary from the executive. The draft ordinance for the Supreme Court secretariat reserves 75 per cent of the positions in the Law and Justice Division including that of the law secretary, as the Judicial Service Association chief says, for judicial officers even when the secretariat begins functioning. Administrative cadre officials oppose judicial officers holding positions in the Law and Justice Division. The proposition as drafted essentially nullifies the executive and the judiciary being independent of each other. The other problem that has surfaced is that although the draft ordinance empowers the chief justice to control the budget of the Supreme Court (secretariat), finance ministry officials have objected to it as they insist on budgetary control through block allocation. This would also keep the judiciary dependent on the executive. The High Court’s special officer, who is also the media spokesperson, says that the independence of the judiciary has yet to be implemented as the secretariat is yet to be established in the light of the Supreme Court’s draft. Legal experts, meanwhile, urge the government to make public the draft of the ordinance, which is waiting for the opinions of the advisers on finance and public administration to the interim government before the final approval of the council of advisers. Experts recommend that the government should seek and assess public opinion on the structure and functions of the proposed secretariat to ensure transparency and accountability. The separation of the judiciary with the establishment of the Supreme Court secretariat is essential. And, it should happen in such a way as to prevent intervention of the executive in the judiciary by any means.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/280346/judiciary-must-in-no-way-be-shackled-to-executive", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 459},

{"title": "Satisfactory yield delights malta farmers in Rajshahi", "body": "Satisfactory yield and fair market prices have brought immense joy to farmers, as many of them are turning their dreams into reality through commercial malta farming in the region, particularly across the Barind tract, over the past few years. Hanif Mondal, 48, son of Amedul Islam of Fatehpur village under Charghat upazila, has emerged as a successful agricultural entrepreneur through malta and other fruit cultivation over the past six years. After completing his graduation from a private university, Hanif chose farming over job hunting and established ‘Hanif Agrofarm and Nursery’ in 2019. He began with malta and orange farming on a limited scale as a pilot project. Gradually, he expanded cultivation to around 12 bighas and also achieved success with guava farming as intercropping. Now, he cultivates mango and other fruits alongside malta and is delighted with this year’s abundant yield. Talking to BSS, Hanif said, ‘I am getting 80 to 100 kilograms of malta from each tree. The demand and market price are quite encouraging. I hope to earn around Taka 10 lakh from this season’s harvest.’ His orchard features several varieties, including BARI Malta-1, Yellow Malta, Vietnam Malta, Morocco Malta, Chinese Orange, Darjeeling Orange, and Paokenu9-1 Malta. Charghat Upazila Agriculture Officer Al Mamun Hassan told BSS that both the soil and climate are suitable for malta cultivation. ‘We are supporting farmers with training, advice, and fertilizers,’ he added. Amzad Hossain, a fruit retailer at Shaheb Bazar in Rajshahi city, expressed satisfaction over the sales trend, saying around 100 kilograms of BARI Malta-1 are being sold daily. Many other entrepreneurs are also benefitting from malta farming, as the locally produced fruit is gaining popularity due to its profitability and quality. Aminul Islam and four of his co-villagers established a commercial orchard on 45 bighas of land in Bottoly area under Godagari upazila. They are now operating the venture successfully. ‘Malta is currently being sold at Taka 80 to 100 per kilogram in local markets, while imported varieties cost Taka 220 to 240 per kilogram. Consumers prefer local malta due to its freshness, better taste, and affordable price,’ said Islam. Godagari upazila agriculture officer Mariam Ahmed said around 110 bighas of land are under malta cultivation in the upazila. She noted that the water-scarce Barind region is well-suited for malta, which requires less water and care compared to other crops. Farmers in the dried areas of Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, and Naogaon are gradually increasing malta cultivation, supported by modern technologies and natural resources. Obaidullah Shah, a farmer from Tentulia village in Porsha upazila of Naogaon, planted 1,560 saplings on seven bighas of land seven years ago. He earned Taka 3.5 lakh in the second year and around Taka six lakh last year. This season, he expects a yield of 1.5 mounds per tree. ‘I have planted a new orchard on six more bighas this year. I regularly receive guidance from agriculture extension and research offices,’ said Shah. He added that commercial malta farming has begun in many areas, energizing local economic activities and improving farmers’ livelihoods. Three young farmers — Mukta Ali, Tofazzal Hossain, and Sultan Ahmed — jointly planted 300 saplings on three bighas of land at Arani Khorda Baosha village under Bagha upazila around eight years ago. After nurturing the orchard for two years, they earned Taka 75,000 in 2019. This year, they expect to sell malta worth around Taka five lakh. ‘Malta farming has brought us success, and now we are fully committed to it,’ said one of the partners. Local farmers are increasingly switching to malta from other fruits and vegetables due to its better returns. This year’s yield is expected to be particularly good, further boosting interest among farmers. Shafiqul Islam, principal scientific officer of the Fruit Research Station in Rajshahi, said BARI Malta-1 is more drought-tolerant and tastier than exotic varieties. ‘Malta farming has become a lucrative option for farmers in the Barind region, contributing significantly to the rural economy and ensuring self-reliance for many ultra-poor families,’ he added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/276955/satisfactory-yield-delights-malta-farmers-in-rajshahi", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 664},

Nasiruddin said that the discussions with the CEC had focused on three issues — the party’s registration, the demand for the lotus symbol and the voting rights of expatriates. He said that while positive news regarding the party’s registration was expected soon, there were concerns about conspiracies to block the lotus symbol. ‘We are not moving away from the lotus symbol. From our party’s position, we remain firm and we want to make all state institutions aware that the NCP will not compromise on this matter,’ Nasiruddin said. Replying to a question, he said that the NCP had predicted a sweeping victory in the forthcoming national election, claiming that it was on course to win 150 seats, as it pushed forward with plans to consolidate a wider youth-led alliance. Nasirudin said the party was preparing to contest all 300 constituencies, promising ‘a ballot revolution that would reshape the country’s political landscape’. He claimed that the next parliament would exclude both the Awami League and the Jatiya Party, while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in his projection, would secure no more than 50 to 100 seats. The interim government, which assumed office after the ouster of the authoritarian Awami League regime in a mass uprising past year, suspended the activities of the AL until the trial of party leaders over atrocities during the July uprising. According to Patwary, the NCP has conducted surveys that suggested ‘strong nationwide support’, and it plans to put forward a diverse slate of candidates, including ulema, lawyers, journalists, women, workers, farmers, and former army officers who took part in the mass uprising. Nasiruddin said that the NCP was positioning itself at the head of a new political bloc, separate from both the BNP-led camp and Islamic parties. He explained that a central part of this strategy was the creation of a broader youth alliance, aimed at uniting political groups formed by young people over the past 15 years. Nasirudin mentioned that discussions were under way with the Gono Odhikar Parishad and other parties, which had expressed interest in joining the coalition, although the final arrangements were still under negotiation. He said that the alliance would be built on shared principles rather than seat-sharing deals, with partners required to dissolve their individual party names and symbols in favour of operating under the NCP’s banner.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/276871/ncp-firm-on-lotus-as-electoral-symbol", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 473},
{"title": "Tension between guardians, teachers grows", "body": "The authorities of different government primary schools across the country on Thursday continued to arrange the ongoing annual examinations by deploying guardians and non-teaching staff of the schools amid teachers’ strike. Tension between guardians and teachers grew as a section of government primary school teachers on the day continued holding strike for the 5th consecutive day, boycotting annual examinations, demanding pay hike and promotion. Since Wednesday they had been also observing ‘complete lockdown’ programme at some government primary schools across the country, protesting at the serving of show-cause notices on some of their leaders and colleagues. Meanwhile, the primary and mass education ministry on Thursday transferred at least 42 protesting teachers, showed a document shared by the teachers’ leaders. In Kalapara upazila under Patuakhali district, the upazila nirbahi officer on Thursday had to break the lock of a school and held the exams. In Nesarabad upazila under Pirojpur district, agitated guardians allegedly clashed with protesting teachers on the upazila parishad office premises. A tension between the guardians and the teachers is intensifying as the guardians alleged that the strikers held the students hostage. Despite an order from the primary and mass education ministry to join work, assistant teachers of the government primary schools vowed to continue their strike until their demands are met. The teachers under the Primary Assistant Teachers’ Association Unity Council demanded a gazette on upgrading the entry-level assistant teacher position to the 11th grade from the existing 13th grade, removing the barriers to achieving higher grades for the teachers who are 10 years and 16 years into the job, and appointing all head teachers from the pool of assistant teachers through promotion. At the government primary schools, annual exams started on December 1. On Thursday, the protesting teachers in the morning locked one of the academic buildings of the Government Mongol Sukh Primary School at Kalapara upazila under Patuakhali district, reported New Age’s Barishal correspondent. Students saw the school building locked when they came to sit for the exams and their guardians got angry. Receiving the news, Kalapara upazila nirbahi officer Kawser Hamid went to the school and broke the lock. The officer said that later the exams were held at the school. According to the school’s acting head teacher, Sheuli Begum, the school has 702 examinees and they held the exams with the help of the school administration and guardians. In Nesarabad upazila under Pirojpur district, a group of protesting teachers staged a demonstration on upazila parishad office premises in the morning to realise their demands. Witnesses said that at one stage some agitated guardians came there, locked into altercation with the teachers and then allegedly clashed with the teachers. Nesarabad upazila nirbahi officer and upazila parishad administrator, Md Zahidul Islam, said that the guardians locked into altercation with the teachers but no incident of clash had been taken place. ‘We calmed them later,’ he added. In the capital Dhaka, the annual exams were held at the government primary schools. Dhaka district primary education officer Md Nurul Hasan said that in the district there were about 950 government primary schools. ‘Annual exams were held at all schools with the support of guardians and non-teaching school staff,’ he added. Barishal district primary education officer Mohammad Mostafa Kamal said that at all 1,588 government primary schools in the district, exams were held in the morning shift but in the day shift, exams were not held at one school. He also said that the exams were held with support of guardians, managing committee members and non-teaching school staff. In Mymensingh, out of 2,140 government primary schools, exams were held at 1,797 schools and exams were not held at 343 schools. The district primary education officer, Md Obaidullah, said that annual exams were held with the help of the upazila nirbahi officer, guardians, managing committee members, school staff and even former students. Kushtia district primary education officer Md Mofizul Islam said that in the district there were 805 government primary schools, and exams were not held in 77 schools in the morning shift and exams were not held in 52 schools in the day shift. Guardians mainly helped the schools hold the exams, he added. The primary and mass education ministry on Wednesday in a press release also said that if teachers failed to join work, action would be taken against the teachers involved in such anti-disciplinary activities according to the employment law, code of conduct, and criminal law. Though the government had earlier, in the face of the teachers’ movement, announced upgrading their salaries to the 11th grade from the 13th grade, the government is yet to issue a gazette regarding this.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/284196/tension-between-guardians-teachers-grows", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 773},

{"title": "Justice is first step towards peace in the CHT", "body": "THE violence leading to deaths, injuries and destruction of houses and businesses of national minority communities in Khagrachari is a consequence of ethnically biased state policies towards the national minorities of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, an issue that successive governments left unattended. On September 28, at least three Marma youths were killed and several dozen were injured, including some members of law enforcement agencies, during a roadblock programme in Khagrachhari’s Guimara upazila. The roadblock was called to protest the rape of a minor Marma girl and demand the immediate arrest of the rapists, and it continued defying the curfew imposed on September 27. Locals say that, fearing habitual delay in arresting the perpetrator, ordinary people as well as primarily CHT-based student and political groups started organising immediately after the report of rape on September 23. The protests, however, quickly turned into an occasion of communal and state violence when several minority youths were reportedly attacked with machetes on September 27. Locals’ fear is not unfounded, given justice historically remained elusive in the CHT. The CHT affairs adviser, as well as the home affairs adviser, assured that perpetrators of the violence in Guimara would be brought to justice, but their assurance rings hollow as they failed to ensure justice for the grave violations of human rights since the interim government was installed in August 2024. In September 2024, at least three ethnic minority youths were killed, and over 200 houses and business establishments of minority communities were razed to the ground in Khagrachhari and Rangamati, but a year later, the public remains in the dark about the investigation and progress of the legal proceedings. Instead of providing legal support, women of ethnic minority communities are subjected to further state surveillance and violence, as is evidenced in the rape and sexual assault of two Marma sisters in Rangamati in 2018. The protest against the rape of two Marma sisters allegedly perpetrated by men in uniform was violently repressed, and the legal case remained frozen. In the context of this long history of impunity, the home adviser’s comment, which squarely terms the Guimara violence as a conspiracy of the fallen regime, is disturbingly similar to the ways past governments have responded to violence against minority communities in the CHT. The interim government should, therefore, not see the recent episode of violence and extrajudicial killing in isolation but rather in the context of decades of ethnically chauvinistic state policies towards the national minority communities in Bangladesh. In doing so, the government should ensure a timely, credible probe into the deaths, injuries and destruction in Khagrachari. It must act because a political resolution to the instability will not only pave the way for pluralist democracy in Bangladesh, it will also secure its border and protect its geopolitical interests.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/277519/justice-is-first-step-towards-peace-in-the-cht", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 463},

The 2024 Ballon d'Or winner missed most of last season following knee surgery and has been plagued by fitness issues so far this term. City have lost three of their opening nine league games to slip six points behind leaders Arsenal. Yet, Guardiola's men have only lost once in their last 11 games in all competitions to start strongly in the Champions League and reach the League Cup quarter-finals. Rodri is set to be involved for the first time in nearly a month when City host second-placed Bournemouth at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. ‘I think he (Rodri) will be ready to help. I don't know if he will be able to play from the beginning, but hopefully he can be with us,’ Guardiola told reporters on Friday. Erling Haaland is also fit despite picking up a knock the 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa last weekend that halted City's momentum in the title race. ‘Still, we're not our best but we're close,’ added Guardiola. ‘I've said before that we have the smell when I see the team and the training dressing room, how we apply and how we want to do things. ‘I have the feeling Rodri can become his best, we'll be a team that's difficult to beat. ‘Will we be still close to the (title) fight? I don't know but from the beginning since the Club World Cup in the United States, I'm optimistic about what this team can do this season.’ City begin the weekend two points behind Bournemouth, who are on an eight-game unbeaten run in the Premier League. Guardiola has been particularly impressed by the Cherries after they cashed in on three of their preferred back four last season. Milos Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi joined Liverpool, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively for combined fees in excess of £150 million ($198 million). ‘They are top.

{"title": "Israel threatens to use ‘unprecedented force’ in Gaza City", "body": "The Israeli military warned on Friday it would operate with ‘unprecedented force’ in Gaza City, telling residents to flee southwards as it presses its ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre. Israel has pummelled Gaza City with strikes and tank fire in its bid to seize it, nearly two years into the war that has devastated the Palestinian territory and left the Gaza City area gripped by a UN-declared famine. The assault comes ahead of a planned move by several Western countries, including France and Britain, to recognise a Palestinian state next week at a UN summit. The military launched its major ground offensive on Tuesday and has for days been telling residents to head south, but many Palestinians say the journey is prohibitively expensive and they do not know where to go. The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings. The military on Friday said it estimated 4,80,000 of them have fled since late August. On Friday, the military’s Arabic-language spokesman announced the closure of a temporary evacuation route opened 48 hours earlier, saying the only way south was via the Al-Rashid coastal road. ‘From this moment, Salah al-Din Road is closed for southbound travel,’ Avichay Adraee, said in a post on X addressing residents of the city, referring to the main north-south artery through the Gaza Strip. Israel had on Wednesday announced a ‘temporary’ new route for residents to flee along the road, saying it would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT). ‘The Israel Defence Forces will continue to operate with unprecedented force against Hamas and other terrorist organisations,’ Adraee said on X on Friday. ‘Take this opportunity and join the hundreds of thousands of city residents who have moved south to the humanitarian area.’ The Israeli military has urged Palestinians to head to a ‘humanitarian area’ in the southern coastal area of Al-Mawasi, where it says aid, medical care and humanitarian infrastructure will be provided. Israel first declared the area a safe zone early in the war, but has carried out repeated strikes on it since then, saying it is targeting Hamas. Nivin Ahmed, 50, fled south from Gaza City to the central city of Deir el-Balah on Thursday, walking with seven family members. ‘We walked more than 15 kilometres, we were crawling from exhaustion,’ she said. ‘My youngest son cried from fatigue. We took turns dragging a small cart with some of our belongings.’ Mona Abdel Karim, 36, said she had been unable to secure transport south and had been sleeping with her family on Al-Rashid street for two nights waiting for a driver. ‘I feel like I’m about to explode. We can’t walk on foot — my husband’s parents are elderly and sick, and the children are too weak to walk,’ she said. AFP footage from Al-Rashid street on Thursday showed long lines of Palestinians heading south on foot or in vehicles piled high with meagre belongings. Israeli fire killed at least 22 people across the territory on Friday, including 11 in Gaza City, according to a tally of figures given by Gaza hospitals contacted by AFP. In a statement, the Israeli military said its troops continued to ‘expand their activity’ in Gaza City, adding it had ‘dismantled more than 20 military infrastructure sites’ over the past day. In western Gaza City on Friday, displaced Palestinian Sami Baroud described ‘relentless and intense shelling’. ‘Our life has become nothing but explosions and danger,’ the 35-year-old said by telephone. ‘We have lost everything — our lives, our future, our sense of safety. How can I evacuate when I can’t even afford transportation?’ The US-backed offensive on Gaza City came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing ‘genocide’ in the Gaza Strip, saying prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime. Israel rejected the findings and slammed the probe as ‘distorted and false’. The United States on Thursday again vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, shielding its ally Israel from diplomatic pressure. Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,174 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/276560/israel-threatens-to-use-unprecedented-force-in-gaza-city", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 741},

{"title": "Govt slammed for arrest of Abul Sarkar, attacks on bauls", "body": "Political and cultural activists attending a protest programme on Monday slammed the government for arresting baul singer Abul Sarkar and attacks on bauls. They condemned political parties’ silence regarding the issue. The protest programme organised by Sadhuguru Bhakta O Oli-Aulia Ashekan Parishad in front of the National Press Club in the capital Dhaka demanded immediate and unconditional release of Abul Sarkar and ensuring his safety. The event also demanded immediate action against the people who attacked bauls under the banner of ‘Tawhidi Janata’ during a human chain formed in Manikganj demanding the release of Abul Sarkar on Sunday. Earlier, on November 20, Abul Sarkar was detained by Detective Branch members from a music show in Madaripur and was later sent to jail on the same day in a case filed in Manikganj over allegations of hurting religious sentiments. Poet and thinker Farhad Mazhar, renowned singer Aleya Begum, filmmaker Akram Khan, singer Kohinur Akter Golapi, cultural activists Shakira Parvin Suma, Dipanto Raihan, Bangladesh Supreme Party joint secretary general Md Ibrahim Mia, writer Arif Rahman, among others, spoke at the event moderated by Bhabboithoki coordinator Mohammad Romel. Farhad Mazhar said that the citizen rights, dignity and freedom of expression were under threat under the interim government due to ‘religious fascism’. He also said that the government violated the citizen rights by arresting Abul Sarkar, adding ‘political parties are silent on the issue for pleasuring voters but they will lose public involvement in the future.’ Aleya Begum alleged that the police did not take any step against the attackers on bauls in Manikganj and did not file any case in this regard, rather they urged the victims to settle the issue while they were admitted at a hospital. Akram Khan said that the government must abolish all laws which went against human rights. Arif Rahman said that Abul Sarkar was the victim of misinformation because a vested group spread his fragmented speech. After the protest, they handed over a memorandum to home adviser retired lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, demanding immediate release of Abul Sarkar and arrest of the attackers on bauls. New Age’s Dhaka University correspondent reported that some left leaning organisations under the banner of anti-fascist people on Monday evening brought out a torch procession and held a protest rally at the DU campus regarding the issue. The procession began at about 7:00pm from the TSC area and marched through key points of Dhaka University and Shahbagh before ending in front of the Raju Memorial Sculpture. Addressing the gathering, singer Shayan said that Bangladesh belongs to its people — Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Buddhists alike. ‘Everyone has the right to live with dignity as they are,’ she said. Earlier in the evening, a group of students organised a cultural programme titled Pratibadi Baul Sandhya at the TSC’s Payera Chattar in protest against the recent attack on baul artistes. The event, held at about 6:00pm, was initiated by Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal Dhaka University unit leaders, with participation from members of various TSC-based organisations. Regarding the issue, cultural affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki on Monday wrote on his verified Facebook account, which triggered a social media backlash.

{"title": "ECB chief says eurozone weathering Trump tariff storm", "body": "European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said Tuesday US tariffs had not hit the eurozone as badly as feared, but warned new risks could lie ahead in an uncertain world. Europe, which runs a hefty trade surplus in goods with the United States, was one of US President Donald Trump’s major targets as he unleashed a barrage of levies on friends and foes alike. The European Union struck a framework deal in July setting tariffs on most exports to the United States at 15 percent—far higher than before Trump’s return but below eye-watering levels on occasion threatened by the American leader. In 2025, Europe had been at the ‘receiving end’ of ‘trade deployed as a tool of power’, Lagarde said in a speech in Helsinki. Most had assumed that US tariff increases ‘would trigger a major adverse shock to the euro area economy,’ she said. But those ‘assumptions have not been borne out’. Lagarde pointed to several reasons for this: retaliation had been limited, avoiding major supply chain disruption; while the euro’s strengthening against the dollar due to concerns about US economic policy had provided extra support. In addition, uncertainty surrounding trade policy had hit growth and investment less than expected, she said. This was in part due to the July deal with Trump, but also because European governments took growth-boosting measures, such as pledging greater defence spending. But she warned that, in the current climate, ‘new trade and geopolitical shocks will remain a constant feature of our environment’. On interest rates, she repeated that the ECB remained in a ‘good place’ after recent falls in inflation, with the shock of recent years triggered by the Ukraine war and post-Covid supply chain woes having faded. Inflation in the eurozone has stabilised around the ECB’s two-percent target in recent months. After bringing rates down from record highs, the central bank has held them steady at its past two meetings, and most analysts do not expect a change soon.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/277641/ecb-chief-says-eurozone-weathering-trump-tariff-storm", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 327},

{"title": "3-way tug of crisis clouds fair poll prospects: TIB", "body": "Transparency International Bangladesh executive director and National Consensus Commission member Iftekharuzzaman on Friday said that the next national elections faced a major challenge due to a three-way tug of crisis within the government’s administrative structure. He noted that the bureaucracy then comprised three types of officials—those loyal to the previous government, those long deprived of positions, and a handful of neutral officers—creating an institutional imbalance that could undermine prospects for a fair election. ‘Free and impartial elections are impossible if political parties themselves are not committed to ensuring them. Apart from political will, the neutrality of election observers and the media is also crucial for a credible election,’ he said. He made the remarks while inaugurating an election training programme, organised jointly by the Reporters Forum for Election and Democracy and TIB at the organisation’s Dhanmondi office in Dhaka. Highlighting weaknesses in the administrative framework, Iftekharuzzaman said that many officials loyal to the Awami League then held their positions. The interim government had to move toward the election while keeping these weaknesses in mind. He added that law enforcement agencies also reflected partisan bias, a structure that had evolved not just over the last 16 years but throughout the past 54 years. ‘Those who were long deprived are now regaining ground, but even in that process, politicisation has been reinforced. Every institution has come under dual partisan influence, fuelling professional conflicts. Only a handful of officers are genuinely trying to remain neutral,’ he said. The TIB chief said that the administration was operating under the push and pull of those three forces, and it was neither possible to overhaul the structure overnight nor to completely reconstitute the bureaucracy. However, he expressed hope that with stability and renewed professionalism, gradual changes could be achieved over time. Iftekharuzzaman said that there would be no chance of holding a fair election if the election-time government played a biased role. ‘If the election-time government is biased, fails to play its due role for ensuring the level-playing field or plays a partial role towards any party, there will be no chance of the election being fair. So, we [TIB and media] have to observe their role as well,’ he said. The TIB chief said that the roles of the main stakeholders had to be taken into account for holding a fair and neutral election. ‘Among the list of stakeholders, many think it is the election commission which must play a central or the most important role. I think the role of everyone among the stakeholders is too critical that it is difficult to say whose role is the most important here,’ he said. The TIB executive director, however, said that the election commission had to play the central role as it was their legal and constitutional responsibility. ‘But how much this responsibility is being performed or level-playing field is being created by the EC should be observed. This is why the EC is the first stakeholder in the list and then the election-time government comes in the list of the stakeholders.’ He pointed out that political parties were also key stakeholders. ‘If the political parties don’t truly want fair elections and want to participate in the polls to win at any cost, it would be difficult to ensure a level-playing field,’ he said, adding that the roles of political parties and their candidates should be closely monitored by media and watchdog bodies. Iftekharuzzaman also emphasised the importance of the administration and law enforcement agencies, which come under the purview of the EC during elections. He said that voters and election observers were also significant actors in ensuring a fair election. Turning to the EC’s guidelines for media, Iftekharuzzaman stressed that journalists’ access to polling stations had to be protected in the election. The TIB chief warned that the provision requiring journalists to ‘inform’ the concerned presiding officer before entering the polling station could be misused as a tool of harassment.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/276498/3-way-tug-of-crisis-clouds-fair-poll-prospects-tib", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 655},

The accused — nine Myanmar nationals and two Bangladeshi citizens — were among 14 people rescued after the November 6 shipwreck off a Thai island near the Malaysian maritime border. They are said to be from a group of around 70 undocumented migrants, mostly from Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya community, who were trying to reach Malaysia when their vessel overturned. A charge sheet seen by AFP said the group, aged between 17 and 43, was accused of entering the country around the Malaysian island resort of Langkawi ‘without valid passes’. Langkawi police chief Khairul Azhar Nuruddin said the charges were read in court ‘but they (the suspects) did not understand’. The case was postponed to December 21 in order for interpreters to be arranged, Khairul said. If convicted, offenders faced a fine of up to $2,400 or five years’ imprisonment, or both, and up to six strokes of the cane. At least 36 people died in the sinking with rescue authorities calling off a search for survivors on Monday.

Bangladesh entered the series under pressure on the back of four consecutive ODI series defeats, three under new captain Mehidy. However, the hosts managed to turn it around by registering a 179-run victory in the series decider at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Thursday. ‘It was very crucial for Bangladesh to get back into winning ways,’ Mehidy told reporters after the match on Thursday. ‘We’ve had a bad run, but this possibly is the series that turns things around. I hope next year, when more [ODI] matches come, the boys understand what we’re doing.’ Bangladesh won the first match by 74 runs to break their five-match losing streak. The series had been level after the West Indies secured the second game in super over after the match ended in a tie. In the third and final ODI, openers Soumya Sarkar and Saif Hassan put the hosts in control with a 176-run stand – the highest opening partnership at Mirpur and Bangladesh’s first century stand since 2023. Their efforts helped Tigers post 296-8 before the spinners ran through the visitors’ batters to restrict them to 117, securing the second-largest ODI win and their biggest ever against the West Indies. ‘The way Soumya and Saif batted was excellent. It’s not easy to bat on this surface, but they took responsibility and hit boundaries early on. We discussed how to play in these conditions and agreed we had to stay positive; otherwise, we cannot get runs,’ said Mehidy. Mehidy also defended the use of the home advantage by utilising the spin-friendly surface of the Mirpur, which looked quite different and came under scrutiny again due to its low bounce and sharp turn. In the series where the spinners took 44 wickets, the most in a three-match ODI series. Bangladesh spinners took 26, and the West Indies picked up 18 wickets; the previous highest was 43, which was between India and Sri Lanka in 2024. However, he insisted that home advantage was an integral part of the game. ‘Wherever you play in the world, whoever we play against, they take the home advantage. And I believe that when I played in New Zealand, they took the home advantage. So, if any team comes to Bangladesh, we will definitely take our home advantage,’ he said. Mehidy also credited his bowlers, particularly leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, for maintaining control throughout the series. Rishad finished with 12 wickets, the most by a spinner in an ODI series and second overall behind Mustafizur Rahman’s 13 against India in 2015. ‘Rishad played really well throughout the series.

{"title": "IMF concerned about high unemployment of graduates", "body": "The International Monetary Fund on Thursday enquired about the high unemployment rate among the university graduates in Bangladesh. It made the query at a meeting with officials of the labour ministry, Finance Division, National Skill Development Authority and Skills for Industry Competitiveness and Innovation Programme at the secretariat in the capital Dhaka. The Labour Force Survey 2024 said that the overall unemployment rate was 3.66 per cent in the country while the graduate unemployment rate was 13.5 per cent, the highest among all education levels. The rate has been climbing steadily for years, more than doubling over the past eight years. Finance ministry officials blamed the skills gap between what the graduates learn at the universities and the requirement of the job market for the situation. Most of the universities prioritise theoretical knowledge over practical skills with outdated curricula, weak teaching, low quality of higher education and a lack of strong industry connection, they said. Besides, a large number of graduates are produced each year without a corresponding increase in job opportunities, they added. An IMF mission is conducting its fifth review of its $5.5 billion loan programme to Bangladesh. The latest mission is also linked to the Article IV report, an annual consultation with its member countries on overall economy, on Bangladesh. Finance ministry officials said that enquiring about the country’s job situation by the IMF was more linked to the Article IV report. However, the IMF’s focus on the country’s structural transformation and job creation will help the other multilateral lenders like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, said the officials. Both the WB and the ADB give loans to the government of Bangladesh for implementing development projects aiming at job generation, one of major objects. The IMF mission that will meet finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on November 6 will conclude its review on November 13. The fifth review is linked to the release of the sixth tranche worth about $400 million. Led by Chris Papageorgiou, the IMF mission began the review on Wednesday by holding meeting with Finance Division officials, including its secretary Khairuzzaman Mozumder, in the capital on Wednesday. But the country is unlikely to get the tranche before the national election slated for February. So far, the IMF has disbursed $3.5 billion of the $5.5 billion loan programme. The original amount of the loan programme, which began in 2023, was $4.7 billion.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/280664/imf-concerned-about-high-unemployment-of-graduates", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 399},
{"title": "Rejuvenated Vlahovic taking reins for Juve", "body": "Dusan Vlahovic has been entrusted with leading Juventus’ attack ahead of Saturday’s local derby with Torino, as new coach Luciano Spalletti eyes a Serie A title challenge. Serbia striker Vlahovic looked destined for the exit door this summer as Juve tried to get back some of the massive investment made in January 2022 in order to snatch the then 22-year-old from Fiorentina. Juve spent 70 million euros, plus 10 million euros more in performance-related bonuses, just to sign Vlahovic who was also blessed with an annual net salary of 12 million euros. Vlahovic’s disappointing showings over two-and-a-half years led to him being put on the transfer list in the close season, only for no major bids to come in. That had meant that he was set to leave for free at the end of this season with a contract that expires in June, but six goals this campaign and the arrival of Spalletti last week has has led to Juve saying he could well stay beyond next summer. ‘I’ve been saying since the start of the season that Dusan is only thinking about Juventus and he’s demonstrating that every day,’ said Giorgio Chiellini, now Juve’s strategic manager, before Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League. ‘We’ll assess the situation in due course, the door remains open on both sides.’ Vlahovic was Juve’s best player against Sporting, netting the equaliser and linking play, and he is now above summer signing Jonathan David in the pecking order. He will start again at the Allianz Stadium, where Spalletti’s team can move a point behind league leaders Napoli, after overcoming a small hamstring problem which forced him off the field with Juve chasing a winner on Tuesday. Champions Napoli face a tricky away day at Bologna who like Juve are four points from the summit and are again looking good under Vincenzo Italiano. Trailing Napoli by just one point are Inter Milan, AC Milan and Roma, with Inter hosting Lazio at the San Siro on Sunday night fresh from maintaining their 100 percent record in the Champions League. Former Italy midfielder De Rossi will return to the site of his last match as coach on Sunday when he takes charge of Genoa in an early relegation six-pointer with rock-bottom Fiorentina. De Rossi was sacked by Roma in September last year after a draw at Genoa left his boyhood club without a win from the first four matches of last season. He replaces Patrick Vieira after signing a contract until the end of this campaign in the hope of dragging troubled Genoa out of drop zone. Genoa won their first match of the season on Monday, 2-1 at Sassuolo, and are two points above Fiorentina who are yet to hire a permanent replacement for Stefano Pioli who was sacked on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/281472/rejuvenated-vlahovic-taking-reins-for-juve", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 469},
{"title": "Future of RMG labour", "body": "IN BANGLADESH, the collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013 is remembered as a black day, and the tragedy continues to haunt those who survived it. Before engaging with the study of human rights, I too viewed the collapse largely as an accident, a catastrophic failure of a building that should never have housed factories. Over time, however, my understanding changed. Studying business and human rights made it impossible to see Rana Plaza as a mere accident. It was, instead, a brutal manifestation of a global supply chain model in which profit was prioritised over human life, and where poor workers, most of them women, were treated not as people, but as expendable inputs. For Asian countries leading the Ready-Made Garment industry, particularly Bangladesh, Rana Plaza stands as an enduring example of systemic failure in the governance of business and human rights. Twelve years after the collapse, the Ready-Made Garment sector has expanded significantly. Important improvements in factory building safety have been achieved, largely through legally binding initiatives such as the Accord on Fire and Building Safety and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. Yet despite these developments, the sector now faces a more entrenched crisis: a widening gap between international legal commitments and the harsh commercial realities imposed by global buyers. The recent approval of three key International Labour Organisation conventions by Bangladesh’s interim government has opened a critical window for reform. However, whether these commitments translate into real change depends on how deeply global retailers embed these standards into their purchasing practices. Unequal pricing policies and the continued tolerance of opaque subcontracting arrangements are repeatedly cited as contributing factors behind labour violations and industrial disasters in the sector. Rana Plaza also exposed long-standing weaknesses within the domestic regulatory environment. Although labour laws existed long before 2013, enforcement mechanisms were persistently weak and in many respects remain so today. The Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments has long been constrained by limited resources, institutional capacity and credibility, allowing violations to continue largely unchecked. More fundamentally, workers’ ability to act as their own monitors has been systematically undermined. Freedom of association, as guaranteed under International Labour Organisation convention no 87, and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining under convention no 98, have been eroded through bureaucratic barriers and widespread anti-union discrimination. Registering trade unions remains an arduous process and independent worker voices inside factories are frequently suppressed, weakening enforcement from the factory floor upward. Another persistent failure lies in the lack of sustained political attention from successive ruling governments. While rhetorical support for labour reform is often expressed, meaningful legislative progress has been slow. Amendments to labour laws are regularly delayed and frequently fall short of full compliance with International Labour Organisation standards. This failure is not merely administrative but deeply political. The economic dominance of the Ready-Made Garment sector has shielded factory owners from strict accountability, creating institutional tolerance for a low-wage, high-risk labour model that prioritises export competitiveness over worker safety and dignity. Yet the most decisive pressure within Bangladesh’s supply chain ecosystem is not generated in Dhaka or in Export Processing Zones. It originates in the sourcing offices of major Western brands. Global buying practices driven by fast fashion and relentless price competition have left Bangladeshi suppliers with little bargaining power. Low unit prices, tight lead times and delayed payments compress margins to the point where factories are forced to choose between financial survival and ethical compliance. Investments in occupational safety and health systems, payment of lawful overtime, or even maintaining minimum wages become increasingly difficult under these conditions. Evidence shows that the average unit price paid by European buyers has stagnated or declined, even as demands for sustainability and compliance continue to rise. This reality exposes the limitations of traditional Corporate Social Responsibility models. Voluntary commitments have repeatedly failed to prevent tragedies such as Rana Plaza and the Tazreen Fashion fire. In this context, mandatory Corporate Due Diligence frameworks offer a more credible path forward. The European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive represents a significant regulatory shift. It requires large European Union and non-European Union companies operating within the European market to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for human rights and environmental harms across their operations and value chains. The directive rests on three core obligations. First, it extends accountability by allowing civil liability in European courts for failures in due diligence, creating legal avenues for compensation that did not exist after Rana Plaza. Second, it mandates value chain remediation by requiring brands to assess how their own purchasing practices including pricing, production timelines and payment terms contribute to harm within supplier factories. Third, it requires meaningful engagement with affected stakeholders, ensuring that workers, trade unions and labour-focused civil society organisations are formally involved in the design and implementation of due diligence measures. For Bangladesh, the importance of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive lies in its potential to close long-standing loopholes. Brands sourcing garments from Bangladesh would no longer be able to distance themselves from subcontracting practices or externalise human rights costs. They would be legally compelled to disclose complete supply chains, integrate human rights considerations into pricing decisions and ensure that orders do not foster labour exploitation or environmental harm. In this sense, the directive offers a shift from symbolic assurances to enforceable obligations. Domestically, the ratification of three International Labour Organisation conventions is a significant step forward. However, their practical value depends on implementation. The forthcoming Bangladesh Labour (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025, must be made genuinely accessible to the millions of workers it seeks to protect. At present, many conventions and policy documents remain available only in English, limiting their relevance for workers who cannot read foreign languages. Translating these materials into Bangla and disseminating them through worker organisations, non-governmental organisations and public education initiatives is essential. Without this effort, newly recognised rights will remain confined to technical documents rather than empowering those they are meant to serve. International researchers and academics continue to cite Rana Plaza as a defining symbol of Bangladesh’s garment industry, often to the country’s detriment. Yet the collapse also created an opportunity to reshape the sector’s narrative and move towards more ethical sourcing models, similar to those emerging in countries such as Sri Lanka. That opportunity has been repeatedly constrained by weak enforcement and short-term commercial priorities. Binding due diligence regulations such as the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive now present a renewed chance for systemic reform. Bangladesh has signed international agreements and taken formal steps towards reform. The remaining challenge lies with global brands. Resetting a supply chain long shaped by exploitation requires internalising the cost of human dignity, eliminating tolerance for unmonitored subcontracting and engaging meaningfully with organised workers. The commitments are in place. It is now for the world’s largest buyers to bear the responsibility of making them real.

{"title": "UN slams global apathy in 2026 aid appeal", "body": "The United Nations on Monday hit out at global ‘apathy’ over widespread suffering as it launched its 2026 appeal for humanitarian assistance, which is limited in scope as aid operations confront major funding cuts. ‘This is a time of brutality, impunity and indifference,’ UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told reporters, condemning ‘the ferocity and the intensity of the killing, the complete disregard for international law, horrific levels of sexual violence’ he had seen on the ground in 2025. ‘This is a time when the rules are in retreat, when the scaffolding of coexistence is under sustained attack, when our survival antennae have been numbed by distraction and corroded by apathy,’ he said. He said it was also a time ‘when politicians boast of cutting aid,’ as he unveiled a streamlined plan to raise at least $23 billion to help 87 million people in the world’s most dangerous places such as Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, Haiti and Myanmar. The United Nations would like to ultimately raise $33 billion to help 135 million people in 2026 -- but is painfully aware that its overall goal may be difficult to reach, given US president Donald Trump’s slashing of foreign aid. Fletcher said the ‘highly prioritized appeal’ was ‘based on excruciating life-and-death choices,’ adding that he hoped Washington would see the choices made, and the reforms undertaken to improve aid efficiency, and choose to ‘renew that commitment’ to help. The world body estimates that 240 million people in conflict zones, suffering from epidemics, or victims of natural disasters and climate change are in need of emergency aid. In 2025, the UN’s appeal for more than $45 billion was only funded to the $12 billion mark—the lowest in a decade, the world body said. That only allowed it to help 98 million people, 25 million fewer than the year before. According to UN data, the United States remains the top humanitarian aid donor in the world, but that amount fell dramatically in 2025 to $2.7 billion, down from $11 billion in 2024. Atop the list of priorities for 2026 are Gaza and the West Bank. The UN is asking for $4.1 billion for the occupied Palestinian territories, in order to provide assistance to three million people. Another country with urgent need is Sudan, where deadly conflict has displaced millions: the UN is hoping to collect $2.9 billion to help 20 million people. In Tawila, where residents of Sudan’s western city of El-Fasher fled ethnically targeted violence, Fletcher said he met a young mother who saw her husband and child murdered. She fled, with the malnourished baby of her slain neighbours along what he called ‘the most dangerous road in the world’ to Tawila. Men ‘attacked her, raped her, broke her leg, and yet something kept her going through the horror and the brutality,’ he said. ‘Does anyone, wherever you come from, whatever you believe, however you vote, not think that we should be there for her?’ The United Nations will ask member states top open their government coffers over the next 87 days—one day for each million people who need assistance. And if the UN comes up short, Fletcher predicts it will widen the campaign, appealing to civil society, the corporate world and everyday people who he says are drowning in disinformation suggesting their tax dollars are all going abroad. ‘We’re asking for only just over one per cent of what the world is spending on arms and defence right now,’ Fletcher said. ‘I’m not asking people to choose between a hospital in Brooklyn and a hospital in Kandahar—I’m asking the world to spend less on defence and more on humanitarian support.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/284608/un-slams-global-apathy-in-2026-aid-appeal", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 606},
{"title": "US in ‘pursuit’ of third oil tanker in Caribbean", "body": "The US Coast Guard was pursuing another allegedly sanctioned tanker on Sunday, a US official said, as Washington ramps up its pressure campaign targeting Venezuela’s vital oil sector. The ‘active pursuit’ in the Caribbean Sea was happening a day after the Coast Guard seized its second vessel off Venezuela in two weeks. US president Donald Trump announced on December 16 a blockade of ‘sanctioned oil vessels’ sailing to and from Venezuela, demanding the return of allegedly stolen US assets in the oil-rich South American country. He has also deployed a large navy armada in the Caribbean with a stated mission of combatting drug trafficking, but which Caracas says is a pressure campaign to oust president Nicolas Maduro. ‘The United States Coast Guard is in active pursuit of a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela’s illegal sanctions evasion. It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,’ a US official, said in a statement to AFP. News outlets identified the ship involved as the Bella 1, an oil tanker under US sanctions since 2024 because of alleged ties to Iran and Hezbollah. According to the specialised site TankerTrackers, the ship was en route to Venezuela but not carrying cargo. US forces approached the vessel late Saturday, but the ship did not submit to being boarded and continued sailing, the New York Times reported, citing unnamed officials. Earlier on Saturday, the US Coast Guard seized the Centuries, which according to TankerTrackers is a Chinese-owned and Panama-flagged tanker. It said that ship was loaded with 1.8 million barrels of crude oil at a Venezuelan port earlier this month before being escorted out of the Latin American country’s exclusive economic zone on December 18. An AFP review found that the Centuries did not appear on the US Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned companies and individuals. Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodriguez on Sunday posted a statement to social media about oil giant Chevron sending a tanker from Caracas to the United States carrying Venezuelan oil — without mentioning either vessel interdicted by Washington. ‘A ship of the American company Chevron has set sail from our country carrying Venezuelan oil bound for the United States, in strict adherence to regulations and in fulfilment of the commitments undertaken by our oil industry,’ Rodriguez said on Telegram. Chevron renewed its license this year to extract crude oil from Venezuela, accounting for roughly 10 per cent of the country’s production. ‘Venezuela has always been, and will continue to be, respectful of national and international legality,’ Rodriguez continued. The Trump administration claims that Venezuela is using oil, its main resource, to finance ‘narcoterrorism.’ The US military since September has also conducted a series of air strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Critics have questioned the legality of the attacks, which have killed more than 100 people. Caracas denies any involvement in drug trafficking and insists that Washington is seeking to overthrow Maduro to seize Venezuela’s oil reserves.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/latin-america/285909/us-in-pursuit-of-third-oil-tanker-in-caribbean", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 501},

{"title": "Friday Haat brings rural charm to the city", "body": "Amid the hustle of Dhaka city, a touch of rural Bengal returns every Friday at Unimart Metro at Satarkul near United International University in the capital. The ‘Friday Haat’, an initiative from Unimart, transforms the street into a village market from 7:30am to 3:00pm, allowing city dwellers to enjoy the sights and flavours of a traditional Bangladeshi bazaar. With bamboo stalls representing village haats, the market captures the essence of an age-old countryside haat. Organisers aim to recreate the nostalgia of rural trade culture in an urban setting, helping people reconnect with the traditional market experience. Unimart Limited CEO Gazi Mahfuzur Rahman, told New Age, ‘Through Friday Haat, we aim to recreate the soulful experience of a village haat, offering a moment of tradition and connection within our modern, mechanised urban lifestyle.’ Visitors can enjoy fresh fish, sweets, meat, vegetables, seasonal fruits and traditional pithas. The aroma of hot sweets and pithas fills the air as vendors prepare the items in front of customers. Chef Shukanta from Utshob Sweets believes that the initiative should be expand. He said, ‘The space and duration should be longer.’ He offers treats like rosogolla, jilapi, gulab jam and roshmalai priced between Tk 600 and Tk 1,000. ‘This market brings back memories for many, especially senior citizens who remember the warmth of village haats,’ he said. Fish sellers at the haat reported strong sales, with one vendor selling fish worth Tk 50,000 in a day, including various types such as chital, hilsa and indigenous species like tengra and koi. Fruit seller Parvez noted he also sold Tk 50,000 worth of fruits, with coconuts being the top seller. The meat section saw the sale of 150 kilogram of beef and 121 chickens, with Joypurhat Golden Chicken priced at Tk 280 a kilogram, lower than in stores. Customers at the Friday Haat can pay with cash or digitally, blending convenience with tradition. Diab Alam, a CSE student from UIU, expressed delight at experiencing village culture in Dhaka, enjoying pitha and fresh food. Vegetable seller Tayan Chakma mentioned selling papayas, pineapples, raw vegetables and other fruits from Khagrachhari and Rangamati. He noted that while prices were slightly higher due to the quality of the produce, discounts were available on some items. Organisers observed a pattern familiar on rural markets, with elderly and middle-aged individuals arriving early, often after their morning walks. In response, a health service corner resembling a rural doctor’s haat has been established. Mirza Nusrat Zahan, business development and communication executive from United Healthcare, stated that visitors could check their blood pressure and sugar levels while shopping. This initiative aims to make healthcare affordable and accessible, with services planned every Friday to enhance the community experience. ‘Last week was our first arrangement, and the response was encouraging,’ she added. The market focuses on organic and quality products, attracting growing interest. Attendance increased in the second week, with vendors reporting better sales as the day progressed, despite a brief dip during prayer time. Rabeya Liza, a pitha seller, offers a variety of pithas priced between Tk 25 and Tk 200. She mentioned that her stall at the Friday Haat had received a positive response. For visitors from areas like Gulshan, the experience is refreshing. ‘I came with my family and it feels wonderful, especially seeing the health centre open,’ remarked Manjur Kader Monju, vice-president of Chattogram Press Club, while visiting the market. ‘The village pithas are authentic and rare in the city, making it a unique experience,’ he said. Unimart’s Friday Haat, which first began on December 12, showcases that progress can coexist with tradition as Dhaka continues to grow.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/285617/friday-haat-brings-rural-charm-to-the-city", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 603},

They made the announcement Tuesday evening after a four-hour blockade near the High Court crossing, where the police intercepted their march towards the secretariat from the Central Shaheed Minar on the Dhaka University campus in the afternoon. The blockade created huge traffic congestion in the adjacent areas, including the areas of the High Court, Gulistan, Paltan and Dhaka University. Tuesday was the second consecutive day of the teachers and employees’ non-stop sit-in programme on the Central Shaheed Minar premises. The day was also the second consecutive day of their countrywide work abstention for an indefinite period. They are protesting under the banner of MPO-bhukto Shikkha Jatiyakaran Pratyashi Jote, a platform of the MPO teachers and employees seeking job nationalisation. Their three demands are allowing 20 per cent of their basic salary as house rent allowance, Tk 1,500 as medical allowance and an increase in the festival allowance for employees from the current 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Since Tuesday morning, a huge number of teachers and employees from different districts gathered at the Central Shaheed Minar premises to press home their demands. They began a march towards the secretariat at about 4:00pm. The police, however, stopped the march by putting barricades near the High Court crossing. The protesters then started staging a sit-in there and vowed to continue the protest until their demands were met. Vehicular movement in the nearby areas stopped immediately and caused severe traffic gridlock. Many people had to begin walking to their destinations due to the traffic congestion. At about 8:00pm, the Jote member secretary, principal Delawar Hossain Azizi, announced that they would block Shahbagh intersection at 12:00 noon on Wednesday if the government failed to meet their demands by issuing a circular by that time. He warned that they would announce tougher movement, including a march towards Jamuna and fast unto death if the police attacked the teachers again. New Age correspondent in Sylhet reported that the MPO teachers and employees staged demonstrations on Tuesday, boycotting the scheduled academic and official activities. Md Mokabbir Ali, assistant head teacher of Siraj Uddin Ahmed Academy at Shrirampur in Sylhet city, said that they, like teachers of other institutions, staged a sit-in on the campus by boycotting all academic and official activities.

{"title": "Madagascar anti-govt protesters call for general strike", "body": "Anti-government protesters in Madagascar called on Wednesday for fresh demonstrations and a general strike, seeking to force president Andry Rajoelina to step down, after nearly a week of action by the youth-led movement. A crowd of several thousand people marched at midday (0900 GMT) in the northern city of Antsiranana, calling for the president to resign, a local source said. Police had cordoned off the centre of the capital Antananarivo, AFP journalists saw, although life had mostly returned to normal in the rest of the city. Near daily protests began in Antananarivo on Thursday and spread to other cities across the Indian Ocean nation of almost 32 million people. Despite Rajoelina sacking his government on Monday in a bid to quell the unrest, anger over misgovernance and water and power cuts was intensified by a heavy crackdown on protesters, which has left at least 22 dead and more than a hundred injured, according to the UN. The government has rejected the tally as unverified and ‘based on rumours or misinformation’. ‘The dismissal of the government is not enough for us,’ a spokesperson for the ‘Gen Z’ movement leading the protests said Tuesday. ‘We demand the resignation of the president and the cleaning up of the National Assembly,’ said the protester, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Another anonymous demonstrator said that ‘living conditions of the Malagasy people are deteriorating and getting worse every day’. Rajoelina ‘has been in power for 16 years, but nothing has changed’, he said. Rajoelina, 51, first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, which ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election due to international pressure, Rajoelina was voted back into office in 2018 and re-elected in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition. More than 10,000 people demonstrated and clashed with police in central Antananarivo Tuesday, according to a security source, where protesters were once again called to convene on Wednesday. On social media, the Gen Z movement called for the dissolution of the Senate, the Constitutional Court and the electoral commission, as well as for businessman Mamy Ravatomanga, reportedly Rajoelina’s main financial backer, to be put on trial. ‘Trade unions from the public sector are called to join a general strike,’ the movement said. Pope Leon XIV on Wednesday said he was ‘saddened by the news coming from Madagascar’ and called for ‘the promotion of justice and the common good’.

{"title": "Scientists probe Tajik glacier for clues to climate resistance", "body": "Greenland is melting, the Alps are melting and the Himalayas are melting — yet in one vast mountain region, huge glaciers have remained stable, or even gained mass, in recent decades. Can it last? To find out, a dozen scientists, accompanied exclusively by an AFP photographer, trekked high over one glacier in eastern Tajikistan to drill for ice cores — ancient, deep samples that can shed precious light on climate change. In September and October, they first spent four days crossing the country from west to east in four-wheel drives, then climbed on foot to over 5,800 metres altitude on the Kon-Chukurbashi ice cap, near the Chinese border. Camping for a week at the summit, in freezing temperatures and despite a day-long blizzard, the scientists from Switzerland, Japan, the United States and Tajikistan drilled the glacier to extract two 105-metre-long ice cores, in sections. These layers of ice, compacted over centuries, perhaps millennia, form an archive of climate indicators, yielding data on past snowfall, temperatures, atmosphere and dust. They must now be analysed in a laboratory to reveal their dates, said the leader of the team, Evan Miles, a glaciologist affiliated with the universities of Fribourg and Zurich. ‘We’re hopeful for a truly unique core, not just for the region, but for the broader region actually, probably extending back 20 to 25 or 30,000 years.’ The apparently resistant glaciers are spread over thousands of kilometres of high mountain ranges in Central Asia, including Karakoram, Tian Shan, Kun Lun and the Pamir mountains of Tajikistan. By delving back in time in the ice there, researchers hope to find out why these glaciers have resisted the general planetary warming of recent decades — and whether this so-called ‘Karakoram anomaly’ could be ending. ‘This whole region is globally unique because over the last 25 years, these glaciers have shown very, very limited mass loss and even mass gain,’ said Miles. The glaciers have shown some limited signs of loss in recent years, but scientists want to determine whether this is a natural variation or the beginning of a real decline. ‘In order to understand that, we really, really need to have a longer time period of records of both temperature and precipitation at the glacier sites,’ said Miles. ‘That’s the type of information that an ice core can tell us.’ One core will be sent to Japan for analysis and another stored in an underground sanctuary in Antarctica at minus 50C.

{"title": "Questions over Machado’s whereabouts as Nobel event postponed", "body": "Nobel officials delayed a press conference with Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado in Oslo Tuesday, but said they remained confident Venezuela’s elusive opposition leader would collect her award in person. It was not known whether Machado, who has been in hiding since August 2024, was in the city. The Venezuelan government has said it would declare her a ‘fugitive’ if she attends, putting her at risk of arrest if she tries to re-enter the country. Her family is already in the Norwegian capital and said they hoped she would attend. The press conference, traditionally held by the prizewinner on the eve of the December 10 award ceremony in Oslo, was expected to be the 58-year-old’s first public appearance in 11 months. In a message to the media early Tuesday, the institute said the press conference was ‘postponed’, without giving a reason for the delay. ‘Everything suggests that we will manage to organise a press conference today,’ Nobel Institute spokesman Erik Aasheim said. It remained however unclear whether Machado had arrived in Oslo and would be able to accept her award in person on Wednesday. The chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Jorgen Watnes Frydnes, said early Tuesday that her presence was ‘more or less’ confirmed. Machado has accused Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro of stealing the July 2024 election she was banned from standing in, a claim backed by much of the international community. She has lived in hiding in Venezuela since August 2024. She last appeared in public at a demonstration in Caracas on January 9, protesting against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Machado on October 10 for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, challenging the iron-fisted rule of Maduro, who has been president since 2013. Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month the opposition leader would be considered a ‘fugitive’ if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize. ‘By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,’ Saab said, adding she is accused of ‘acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism.’ Venezuelan interior minister Diosdado Cabello said Monday he did not know if she would travel to Oslo. The Nobel prize ceremony will take place on Wednesday at 1:00pm (1200 GMT) at Oslo’s City Hall. Several members of Machado’s family, including her mother, three sisters and daughter, were already in Oslo for the event. ‘I would never have imagined it. I had heard and read that she had been nominated’ for the award, her mother Corina Parisca de Machado said on Monday, recalling the day her daughter won. ‘I thought: ‘Caramba! (Wow!) What a wonderful day that would be’,’ the 84-year-old added. Several Latin American leaders, including Argentine president Javier Milei — like Machado, an ally of US president Donald Trump — were also expected to attend the ceremony. Seen in Oslo on Monday was Panama’s president Jose Raul Mulino, who said he came to ‘congratulate the hero of democracy and the struggling Venezuelan people’ and voiced hope for a ‘return to democracy in Venezuela as soon as possible’. A large police presence has meanwhile stood guard since Monday outside the Grand Hotel in central Oslo, which traditionally hosts the Nobel Peace Prize laureates, AFP journalists said. While Machado has been hailed by many for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, she has also been criticised by others for aligning herself with Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel Prize. The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats. Maduro insists that the real goal of the US operations — which Machado has said are justified — is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves. If Machado does come to Norway to accept her prize, the question then arises of how she would re-enter Venezuela.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/284686/questions-over-machados-whereabouts-as-nobel-event-postponed", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 656},
{"title": "Extrajudicial killing must stop to uphold rule of law", "body": "HUMAN rights violations at the hands of law enforcement agencies were expected to completely stop in the changed political context, but that has not been the case. Since the interim government was installed in August 2024, as Ain O Salish Kendra report, at least 35 people have become victims of extrajudicial killing, which is higher than the number of similar death during the last year of the Awami League government. Another rights organisation, Odhikar, also reports that at least 29 people fell victim to extrajudicial killings from August 2024 to June 30, 2025. There are allegations that the joint forces deployed to restore law and order were involved in a number of cases of extrajudicial killings. The inspector general of police has, however, said that they have no data on extrajudicial killings, which is alarmingly familiar because denial was also the rhetoric of the fallen regime. The government should know that the continued abuse of power by the law enforcement agencies cannot establish the rule of law and, therefore, it should take extraordinary measures to materialise its promises of zero tolerance of extrajudicial killing, enforced disappearances and custodial torture. The cases of custodial torture during the tenure of the interim government marked a decline but are still significant, considering that the goal is to prevent any death in custody. On September 15, two people were found dead in the custody of the Rapid Action Battalion in Sylhet and the Police Bureau of Investigation in Moulvibazar. In February, the joint forces cited a ‘gunfight’ at Mohammadpur in Dhaka where two young people were killed, echoing incidents from previous years that were often discredited by rights groups. The continuation of custodial death and extrajudicial killing under ambiguous circumstances, a violently repressive tendency that characterised the fallen regime, suggests that the institutional machinery that enabled such abuses remains intact. The interim government has formed the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and the police administrative reforms commission to investigate past abuses and make recommendations for reforms, but without ensuring credible investigations of all allegations of rights violations and legal accountability of the perpetrators, it is not possible to break the cycle of impunity that errant law enforcers have enjoyed for decades. The interim government was installed in the aftermath of an uprising with promises for dismantling the authoritarian structure and reorienting state power towards democratic accountability. The recurrence of extrajudicial killing and custodial death not only undermines the promises but also spells out a failure to break from coercive methods of the previous regime. The government must give clear directives and ensure transparent investigation or effect institutional reforms to end extrajudicial killings.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/276617/extrajudicial-killing-must-stop-to-uphold-rule-of-law", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 439},
{"title": "Dhaka becomes 2nd most polluted city with AQI score of 236", "body": "Air pollution remains one of the biggest challenges for Bangladesh, with its capital ranked as the second most polluted city in the world on Friday morning. At about 9:00am, Dhaka’s Air Quality Index score was recorded at 236. India’s Delhi and Egypt’s Cairo occupied the first and third spots, with AQI scores of 270 and 230 respectively. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered unhealthy, particularly for sensitive groups. Similarly, an AQI between 201 and 300 is classified as poor, while a reading between 301 and 400 is deemed hazardous, posing serious health risks to residents. AQI — an index for reporting daily air quality — is used by government agencies to inform people how clean or polluted the air in a particular city is, and what associated health effects may be of concern. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants — Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO₂, CO, SO₂ and Ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution. Its air quality usually becomes unhealthy during winter and improves during the monsoon. A report by the Department of Environment and the World Bank pointed out that the three main sources of air pollution in Dhaka ‘are brick kilns, fumes from vehicles, and dust from construction sites.’ With the advent of winter, the city’s air quality deteriorates sharply due to the massive discharge of pollutant particles from construction work, rundown roads, brick kilns and other sources. Air pollution consistently ranks among the top risk factors for death and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been recognised as increasing a person’s chances of developing heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, lung infections and cancer, according to several studies. According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/environment-climate-change/284229/dhaka-becomes-2nd-most-polluted-city-with-aqi-score-of-236", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 319},

{"title": "Rethinking monosodium glutamate", "body": "MONOSODIUM glutamate, or MSG, has been at the centre of culinary and nutritional debate for over half a century. Chemically, MSG is nothing more than the sodium salt of glutamic acid, an amino acid naturally present in a wide variety of foods, from tomatoes and mushrooms to cheese, soy sauce and even breast milk. Commercially, MSG is produced by fermenting plant starches such as sugar cane or beets into a white, odourless powder. Once ingested, MSG dissolves into sodium ions and free glutamate, the same molecules our bodies routinely consume in protein-rich foods. The glutamate binds to umami, or savoury, receptors on the tongue, enhancing taste and providing the ‘meaty’ satisfaction that many savour in traditional dishes. Far from being an alien chemical, MSG is simply a highly concentrated form of a flavour humans have been enjoying naturally for millennia. The controversy surrounding MSG began in 1968, when a physician published a letter describing weakness and numbness following a Chinese meal. This sparked the term ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome,’ later more neutrally referred to as MSG Symptom Complex. Media sensationalism and a handful of flawed studies further entrenched public fears that MSG could cause headaches, flushing, or other health issues. Yet decades of rigorous research have failed to demonstrate any consistent causal link. Numerous double-blind trials have found no difference between MSG and placebo in provoking symptoms. In one notable study, participants reported discomfort equally whether they consumed MSG or a dummy substitute. Only when MSG is consumed in extraordinarily high doses, typically three grams or more on an empty stomach, do mild effects sometimes appear. By comparison, a typical MSG-seasoned dish contains less than half a gram, meaning such high-dose scenarios are far removed from everyday consumption. Modern nutrition experts now recognise that reports of discomfort are more plausibly linked to other food components, such as histamines or tyramine, or even to the placebo effect, rather than MSG itself. Regulatory consensus reinforces this safety profile. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration classifies MSG as GRAS — ‘generally recognised as safe.’ Its own independent review in the 1990s, conducted by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), concluded that MSG induces only transient, mild symptoms at high doses and is otherwise safe. European authorities, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the United Nations’ Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) echo this assessment. JECFA, notably, has not set an acceptable daily intake limit for MSG, reflecting a lack of toxicological concern. In practice, this means that the tiny quantities of MSG added to most dishes fall well below any threshold of harm. Agencies worldwide uniformly consider MSG safe, and normal dietary intakes, generally between 0.3 and 1 gram per day, pose no risk. True allergic reactions are exceedingly rare, affecting fewer than one in a hundred consumers. The scientific consensus is thus clear: MSG is not toxic when consumed as part of a normal diet. Early studies that raised alarm were often flawed, employing extreme doses, injections rather than oral consumption, or inadequate controls. In culinary contexts, the body metabolises MSG just as it does glutamate from other protein sources. MSG’s primary appeal lies in its ability to enhance flavour economically. Its presence is ubiquitous across global kitchens and food manufacturing. Harvard Health notes that MSG is not limited to Asian or fast-food restaurants; it features in an array of processed and packaged foods, from cured meats and salad dressings to frozen pizzas and instant noodles. In Bangladesh, brands like Ajinomoto supply home cooking MSG, while local food producers import it in large volumes, reflecting widespread use. Beyond taste enhancement, MSG serves numerous practical culinary and nutritional functions. In restaurants and home kitchens alike, a pinch of MSG can enrich vegetarian stews, deepen broths and mimic the complex flavour of long-simmered stocks. In low-sodium cooking, MSG offers an alternative to table salt: with roughly one-third the sodium content, it can maintain palatability while reducing overall sodium intake. Health authorities emphasise this benefit, particularly in regions with high salt consumption, where replacing some salt with MSG could contribute to lowering hypertension risk. MSG is also valuable in making plant-based or lean foods more appetising, enhancing tofu, pea protein, and other vegetarian options. In medical nutrition, hospitals and care facilities use MSG to improve taste in therapeutic or low-salt diets, encouraging appetite and supporting nutritional intake in elderly or unwell patients. Despite its culinary versatility, MSG remains subject to ongoing debate. Potential benefits include improved nutrition for the elderly and ill, support for digestion, and reduced sodium intake without loss of flavour. Research confirms that glutamate activates receptors in the mouth and gut, stimulating saliva and digestive juices, which aid swallowing and digestion. Clinical studies have shown that MSG supplementation in hospital or elderly diets enhances appetite and caloric intake. Moreover, substituting MSG for some salt can reduce total sodium consumption by approximately 40 per cent without compromising taste, a crucial intervention in the prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Common concerns, however, persist. A small fraction of individuals (less than one per cent) report headaches, flushing, or mild discomfort after consuming MSG, though controlled trials indicate that these symptoms arise only at high doses. Epidemiological studies linking MSG to obesity or metabolic disorders are inconclusive; animal experiments that suggested a risk often involved unrealistic doses delivered by injection, not dietary consumption. Neurological concerns raised by rodent studies in the 1960s–1980s are irrelevant to typical human diets, as glutamate from food is largely metabolised in the gut and scarcely crosses into the brain. True IgE-mediated allergic reactions are extremely rare. For the overwhelming majority of consumers, MSG is entirely safe when used in customary culinary amounts. Looking ahead, MSG has the potential to support healthier and more sustainable diets. As global consumption shifts towards plant-based foods, MSG can make vegetable proteins and meat substitutes more palatable by masking bitter or beany flavours. Technological advances in fermentation allow MSG to be produced efficiently from agricultural by-products, making it cheaper and more environmentally sustainable. By enhancing taste, MSG can reduce food waste and promote consumption of nutritious, low-salt foods. Countries like Singapore have explicitly endorsed MSG in national strategies as a tool for sodium reduction, highlighting its public health utility. Yet public perception remains a challenge. Many consumers continue to view MSG with suspicion, driven by decades-old misconceptions and cultural biases. Ingredients naturally rich in glutamate, such as Parmesan or yeast extract, often go unnoticed, while labels boast ‘No Added MSG.’ Stigmatisation of MSG has historically targeted Asian cuisine unfairly, perpetuating cultural stereotypes. Nutritionists, chefs, and influencers are now actively educating consumers about MSG’s safety and benefits, demonstrating that the compound is a naturally fermented ingredient, not a mysterious toxin. Context matters: foods high in MSG are often ultra-processed and high in fat, sugar, or salt, so focusing solely on MSG as a risk factor is misleading. Conversely, low-salt, MSG-enhanced meals can offer net nutritional benefits. Monosodium glutamate has been alternately hailed as a ‘miracle flavour’ and condemned as a ‘villainous additive.’ The truth, illuminated by decades of research, lies between these extremes. MSG is a potent umami seasoning that can reduce the need for salt, enhance the palatability of plant-based and low-sodium foods, and support nutrition in vulnerable populations. Regulatory authorities worldwide affirm its safety, and only a tiny minority of people experience mild sensitivity at unrealistically high doses. For most, MSG simply enables the enjoyment of richer, savourier meals. It is time to retire the myths surrounding MSG. As one expert succinctly put it: ‘MSG is a well-studied food additive deemed safe by major health organisations. While some individuals may be sensitive to it, the majority can enjoy its umami-enhancing properties without concern.’ By acknowledging its true nature, consumers and policymakers can embrace MSG not as a peril but as a safe, effective seasoning that promotes both taste and health. In Bangladesh and beyond, where flavourful cooking is cherished and health challenges such as high blood pressure are pressing, MSG deserves reconsideration. With informed choices guided by evidence, enjoying rich, savoury food and maintaining good health need not be mutually exclusive. In essence, MSG is more than a mere flavour enhancer; it is a culinary and nutritional ally. By dispelling unfounded fears, celebrating its versatility and recognising its role in sustainable diets, we can elevate both our meals and our understanding of food science. After decades of stigma, MSG deserves its place on our tables — safely, wisely and deliciously.

{"title": "English and public examination results", "body": "THE results of the 2025 Higher Secondary Certificate and equivalent examinations released a couple of weeks ago ‘jolted’ the nation. These conventional measures of student learning have been called a ‘debacle’, which should also serve as a ‘wake-up’ call for all. It’s a call for no-nonsense (re)thinking of education quality, student learning, and assessment that produces artefacts such as grades and GPAs. The social shock was caused by some key statistics. The overall pass rate was 58.83 per cent which was the lowest in the past 21 years in the country. It also marked a significant drop from last year when it was 77.78 per cent. This means over 41 per cent students failed the exam this year. The results are not just about student failure. The numbers are a diagnosis of our education system, which itself has been questioned. It is also a failure of schools and teachers — and probably private tutors and coaching centres as well. Failed students and their parents will bear the brunt of the results. The second important statistic is that most student failures occurred in English and mathematics. There may be nothing new about student performance on these two critical subjects. I will mainly talk about English, as this is my area of research interest. While the HSC results stirred almost the entire nation, one section of the population would have been in a mood of silent celebration. Every untoward happening since Hasina’s fall in August 2024 has given this section of our society a precious moment of joy and a sense of retribution. Their collective logic and judgement might be something like, ‘We deserved nothing better after what was done to Hasina’, their undisputed embodiment of democracy, development, and progress. They would probably draw our attention to the HSC pass rate, which was never below 75 per cent during the rule of Hasina and her education minister Dipu Moni. The interim government provided an unflattering explanation for the lower pass rate. The gist of the account is the Hasina government manipulated numbers in every field, including education. During her regime, higher pass rates in public examinations were not true indicators of student learning. The numbers were manufactured to create a positive image of her government as a way of fighting the legitimacy crisis. Often, directives were given to different departments to indicate higher levels of performance. Teachers and education boards were also brought under such directives. It showed a particular ontological and epistemological stance on numbers and statistics. For the regime, numbers were not only elastic but also loosely related to facts. An article of mine that appeared in New Age on 29 August 2022, when Hasina was at the height of her power, began with our national attitude towards numbers: ‘As a nation, we probably need an honest interrogation of our attitudes towards numbers. The search may zero in on how we produce our numbers, what value we attach to them, and how ethical our numerical engagement is. We also need to reflect on how other nations might have been treating us given our stance on numbers and number-making.’ Indeed, one qualitative difference between Hasina’s and the current government is that the latter does not brag about development or progress. We haven’t heard many stories of magical development since she fled the country. It is as if the agent who controlled the material, discursive, and digital display of development propaganda from a distance switched it off. The interim government’s explanation of the HSC pass rate appears trustworthy. As they don’t suffer from legitimacy issues, they don’t have to hide, inflate, or deflate numbers or manufacture truths. The education advisor claimed that the current pass rate was a true measure of students’ learning. Un-spiced truth may be hard to swallow, but it is better than the illusion of ‘fake truth’, also known as ‘post-truth’. The current HSC pass rate may not be the product of political directives. However, that does not necessarily mean that there is a clear correspondence between the pass rate and students’ true achievement of learning. This point can be clarified by referring to the English subject. My PhD research investigated secondary school students’ English learning experiences and outcomes in rural Bangladesh in 2006-2007. As part of the research, I examined students’ performance on the SSC examination, which showed that most students failed in English and mathematics. So, students’ performance on these two subjects in the recent HSC examination has a long history. There are many views of English, English learning, standards of English, and students’ ability to communicate in English in Bangladesh. In my humble opinion, the overall English proficiency level is increasing day by day. This is not because of the improved quality of English teaching but because of the many opportunities for learning English that are now available outside the classroom. In fact, language learning beyond the classroom has emerged as a new area of research which has documented many success stories of students developing genuine proficiency in languages such as English, Arabic, Korean, and Japanese. For English learning outside the curriculum in Bangladesh, the key question is whether students have access to online resources through their family and whether they are keen on utilising them. This access is acutely unequal given the socioeconomic and geographic divides in the country. Learning English or another language outside the curriculum is likely to develop students’ functional ability. Although this learning can help them at school and during school-leaving examinations, our English language assessment is unlikely to capture students’ ability to communicate in English in real-life contexts. The reading- and writing-focused pen-and-paper test, which excludes listening and writing skills, cannot provide any sensible measure of English language ability. Indeed, what is measured by school English tests or public examinations is a question that has never been asked seriously. How the exams assess what they assess is another question worth considering. In our research, we have argued that assessment in Bangladesh is often taken as an academic ritual which does not explicate the what, the how, or the why of assessing. The rise and fall of numbers that claim to measure student learning should rightly affect us, but shouldn’t we also be interested in knowing what is measured and why and how it is measured, and whether the numbers have any educational, social, or practical value? It will be hard to claim that school or school-leaving exams are a true measure of students’ English proficiency. Therefore, grades obtained by students — whether A, B, or C — may not say much about their relationship with the global language. Students learn English for 12 years at a huge cost of the curricular space and scant national resources, but we hardly ever get to know how such investment relates to their lives or society. My language testing research has a critical, socio-political focus. I am not a fan of tests or testing. However, I find it unacceptable that the Bangladeshi education system has not done much about meaningfully assessing students’ English learning at different levels of education. Many Asian countries have taken their language assessment seriously, borrowing ideas, theories and experiences from other parts of the world. Bangladesh needs to move forward fast and introduce English language tests which will tell more about our students’ proficiency and their ability to use the language for educational and social goals.

They can only be feared, especially as scientists can make long-term forecasts of the probability for a region. This suggests that there can only be preparedness in the fight against such natural disasters. The earthquake of the magnitude of 5.5, with its epicentre at Madhabdi in Narsingdi at a depth of 10 kilometres, that shook Bangladesh in the morning on November 21 has showed that Bangladesh is least prepared to face earthquakes. At least 10 died and more than 1,000 people were injured in the earthquake. Cracks appeared in several dozen buildings whilst some buildings tilted as the earthquake of a moderate intensity woke up people to the under-preparedness or even lack of preparedness that the authorities have so far lived with. As the earthquake happened, people panicked and hurried out of their houses to open places. A large number of victims were injured in stampedes or when objects fell on them. Some even jumped from building floors. This also shows that the government has not adequately run earthquake drills to keep people informed of what they should do in the event of such disasters. Eight power plants also went off-grid. Whilst risks remain grave for the whole of the country, the risks are greater in Dhaka as Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, the agency responsible for the development of the capital city, says that 80 per cent of the houses in Dhaka have been built without approval. Data of the agency’s detailed area plan show that 2.1 million structures, including more than half a million multi-storey buildings, which have more than two floors are erected without approval. The agency’s chief town planner says that there are more than 2,000 buildings above 10 storeys compared with 1,840 in 2019. The risks appear serious as experts fear that there could be more earthquakes. They think that the November 21 incident was a foreshock of a strong one that might happen any time. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department recorded 76 earthquakes of varying intensity that shook Bangladesh and its neighbours only in 2025. Research suggests, as experts say, that strong earthquakes take place every 100–125 years. As the last strong earthquake that hit Bangladesh occurred in the 1930s, it appears that Bangladesh is now almost at the juncture. With the lack of preparedness or under-preparedness, it could spell out disasters of a greater intensity if issues are not mended now. The government should, therefore, immediately take stock of risky buildings to retrofit or demolish them. Whilst it should also shore up other preparedness issues, it should run campaigns and earthquake drills to keep people informed of what to do in the event of such disasters. And, the government has no scope to show leniency in this direction.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/282904/a-stark-warning-on-earthquake-readiness", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 458},
{"title": "Interim government’s major accomplishment stronger Bangladesh-US relations: Shafiqul Alam", "body": "Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam on Sunday said that one of the major accomplishments of their foreign policy over the past 15 months has been establishing strong relations with the United States agricultural economy and the farm lobby. ‘The interim government has laid the foundation for this promising new chapter in Bangladesh-US relations,’ he said. Looking ahead, Alam said, Bangladesh will be able successfully negotiate even greater tariff reductions from the United States as the trade gap shrinks. ‘Our garment exporters already have the capacity to purchase the entirety of US cotton exports. Once we establish ourselves as a key US trading partner, we will have no need to engage costly lobby groups in Washington — we will have the US farm lobby, which has considerable political strength, to advocate for us with US governmental entities,’ he said. ‘Japan, China, Southeast Asian nations, and Western European countries have all prospered through robust trade with the United States. Now, we too can follow that path,’ Alam said in a message shared from his verified Facebook account. A few months after Khalilur Rahman was appointed as the high representative on Rohingya affairs and later as national security adviser, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus sent him to Washington DC in February to build ties with the new US administration. Khalil, a veteran career diplomat and an eminent economist who spent decades at a senior level at a UN organisation specialising in global trade policy, quickly connected with key figures in the American agricultural sector, he said. Alam said Bangladesh is a major importer of agricultural products, while the US is one of the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, wheat, cotton, and corn. ‘Access to US agricultural market is potentially a crucial aspect of our food security, which is one of our key national security concerns,’ he said. It also would allow us to diversify food import sources and thereby to avoid potential situations where certain sourcing countries might weaponise our food dependence on them. Khalil helped strengthen the bridge between Bangladeshi importers and the US farm lobby — a relationship that played a crucial role in our successful recent tariff negotiations with Washington. ‘Besides, his successful efforts as our lead negotiator contributed to securing competitive tariff rates that have effectively safeguarded Bangladesh’s garment industry,’ Alam said. Earlier this week, Bangladeshi importers pledged to purchase over one billion dollars’ worth of US farm products — a ‘win-win outcome’ for both countries and a milestone in Bangladesh-US relations, said the press secretary. With China sourcing most of its soybeans from Brazil, Bangladesh can, in a meaningful way, help fill the gap left by Chinese importers, he said.

Shahbagh police officer-in-charge Md Moniruzzaman said that the protesters blocked Shahbagh crossing, halting vehicular movement in the area for about five hours. At the time of filing this report at 10:00pm, vehicular movement to and from Dhaka University was closed, while some vehicles were allowed to move in the other directions around Shahbagh crossing, New Age Dhaka University correspondent reported. At around 7:30pm during the sit-in, the platform’s central member secretary Abdullah Al Zaber announced that the blockade at Shahbagh crossing would continue on Saturday. He said that people from across the country were heading to the capital to join the blockade by morning. ‘We will not leave until justice is ensured,’ he vowed. The organisation also demanded formation of a fast-track judicial tribunal for the trial of the killing of Hadi within a maximum of 30 working days, inclusion of internationally-recognised investigation agencies, such as, the FBI or Scotland Yard to ensure a neutral probe, and resignation of the home and law advisers. On December 12, Hadi was shot in the head from close quarters in the capital while conducting his electioneering as an independent candidate for the Dhaka-8 constituency. After treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Evercare Hospital in the city, he was flown to Singapore for advanced treatment but there he succumbed to injuries on the night of December 18. Law enforcers have so far arrested at least 11 people for their suspected involvement in the attack on Hadi, but the main suspects are yet to be arrested and are believed to have fled to India.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/286254/hadi-murder-2-sent-to-jail-shahbagh-blocked-demanding-justice", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 383},
{"title": "Russia negotiates withdrawal from Serbian oil company", "body": "Russian interests are negotiating their withdrawal from key Serbian oil company NIS which now faces US sanctions, Serbia’s energy minister said Tuesday. After allowing several postponements since January, the US Treasury started applying sanctions against NIS on October 9 as part of a campaign by US President Donald Trump against the Russian energy sector over the Ukraine war. NIS is the latest Eastern European energy company to seek a new owner because of sanctions. Bulgaria’s parliament on Friday passed a law to let a major refinery owned by Russia’s Lukoil come under state control. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has secured a one year exemption from US sanctions so that his country can keep buying Russian oil. Russia’s Gazprom Neft and its owner Gazprom have held nearly 45 percent of NIS since 2009. Gazprom recently transferred about 11 percent to another Russian firm, Intelligence. The Serbian state has just under 30 percent. Serbian officials feared that continued Russian control of NIS could harm the Balkan country’s economy. ‘The Russian owners of the NIS company have sent a request to OFAC (the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control) to request an extension of the operating licence, on the basis of negotiations with a third party,’ Energy Minister Dubravka Djedovic said in a statement on Instagram. ‘The request indicates that the Russian side is ready to cede control and influence in the NIS company to a third party,’ added the minister who did not indicate who the potential buyer was. NIS runs Serbia’s main refinery at Pancevo near Belgrade which supplies about 80 percent of the country’s needs. The Serbian government has ‘officially supported’ the Russian request and OFAC could give an answer this week, the minister said. ‘We must find a solution.’ NIS employs about 13,500 workers and has more than 400 petrol stations, mostly in Serbia though there are 80 in Bosnia, Bulgaria and Romania. NIS had turnover of 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) in 2024 but announced a loss of 153 million euros at the end of the year.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/281886/russia-negotiates-withdrawal-from-serbian-oil-company", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 341},

{"title": "Govt warns against spreading speculation over data protection laws", "body": "The government on Friday urged all parties to avoid spreading speculation or miscommunication over the approved Personal Data Protection Ordinance and National Data Governance Ordinance. The special assistant to the chief adviser for the posts, telecommunications and information technology ministry, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, came up with the cautionary instruction in an open letter to the media. Faiz in the letter assured that the government maintained transparency and all commitments and assurances made during previous consultations and accurately reflected in the ordinances. He warned that the government would not allow vested interests or misinformation campaigns to block essential national reforms. Faiz’s remarks came amid criticisms of the ordinances by several organisations, including the Transparency International Bangladesh, over the approval of the two ordinances alleging that the ordinances were passed without adequate consultations with the stakeholders. Faiz’s letter titled ‘Clarification and Further Engagement on PDPO and NDGO’ stated that the government had undertaken extensive consultations with stakeholders — both domestic and international — throughout the drafting process of the Personal Data Protection Ordinance. The letter requested all parties to refrain from practicing or communicating beyond their professional scope and avoid spreading unnecessary speculations regarding these legislative efforts. ‘All commitments and assurances communicated during previous consultations have been respected and accurately reflected in the final PDPO,’ he said. The letter addressing the digital community members of Bangladesh said that it had been consistently communicated that the government would establish an authority, whose role had been defined by and within the PDPO itself. The authority is not limited to overseeing PDPO implementation alone; rather, it is designed primarily as an institutional mechanism for internal, inter-ministerial, and intra-governmental data governance and coordination. Its structure, functions, and mandate were finalised after a wide inter-ministerial consultation, it added. The letter said that the government had not introduced any provision mandating data localisation as reported in a recent newspaper article rather adopted a cloud-first approach. The PDPO only requires that personal data classification that certain highly sensitive data — such as NID, biometric identifiers, voter information, date of birth, and banking data — should be governed under Bangladeshi law, as is standard practice globally. Common data, such as text messages, photos, contents, videos, documents and emails are not included under this category, it said, adding that even for restricted personal data, the law allowed processing abroad, provided it remained legally accountable to the Bangladeshi court’s jurisdiction. The ordinance uses the term ‘substantial volume’ regarding the transfer of restricted personal data abroad — meaning bulk transfers of such data would require consent/approval for security and sovereignty reasons. According to the letter, the PDPO offers an 18-month transition period and has introduced a consent-based data fiduciary and processing framework that aligns with global best practices, including the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and ASEAN standards. On October 9, the government during a meeting of the council of advisers approved the Personal Data Protection Ordinance, 2025, designed to safeguard citizens’ data privacy and establish a comprehensive legal framework in the digital domain.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/280115/govt-warns-against-spreading-speculation-over-data-protection-laws", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 502},
{"title": "AB Bank’s 20 defaulters hold 50pc of NPL", "body": "AB Bank’s top 20 loan defaulters collectively held Tk 14,762 crore, which is near half of the banks total default loans, according to Bangladesh Bank data. Buildtrade Group, Orion group, Beximco Group and Sikder Group are among the top defaulters at AB Bank. AB Bank’s cash crisis has deepened to a critical level, forcing the bank to seek another Tk 1,000 crore from the Bangladesh Bank as deposit withdrawals surge and default loans overwhelm its balance sheet. The bank now stands in one of the worst positions in the sector, with default loans making up over 82 per cent of its portfolio and withdrawal pressure draining its cash reserves. AB Bank requested this fresh liquidity support from BB through a letter to the central bank on November 30. It comes only two weeks after the Bangladesh Bank released Tk 1,500 crore against the bank’s earlier request for Tk 2,000 crore. In its latest letter, the bank said the Tk 1,500 crore supports fell short of stabilising the outflow. Withdrawals have escalated sharply in recent weeks, and the bank has struggled to meet customers’ demands, it said. At the top of the defaulters list is Buildtrade Foils Limited, which alone owes Tk 1,393 crore in defaulted loans. The company is part of the Buildtrade Group, which has two more defaulting entities at the bank. Alloy Coat Limited owes Tk 1,163 crore, and Buildtrade Engineering owes Tk 991 crore. Together, the group’s three companies owe Tk 3,547 crore in defaulted loans. Following Buildtrade Group, Orion Oil and Shipping Limited, owned by the Orion Group, ranks second with Tk 1,213 crore in default loans. In third place is Mahi Enterprise, which owes Tk 1,089 crore. Fifth on the list is Beximco LPG Unit-1 Limited, which has defaulted on Tk 1,002 crore. The remaining companies on the top 20 defaulters’ list include: Creative Trade with Tk 785 crore; Pacific Bangladesh Telecom with Tk 723 crore, owned by Morshed Khan; Bell Construction with Tk 699 crore, part of the Sikder Group owned by Rick Haque Sikder; Asian Education of the Asian Group with Tk 613 crore; Ardent Systems with Tk 591 crore; Dhaka Central International Medical College and Hospital with Tk 570 crore; Asturam Publication with Tk 569 crore; SS Steel with Tk 551 crore; Rising Steel with Tk 528 crore; and Grand Trading Enterprise with Tk 479 crore. The list also includes R&R Holdings, another Sikder Group company owned by Ron Haque Sikder, which owes Tk 468 crore; Saleh Steel Industries with Tk 465 crore; Aegis Textile Mills with Tk 424 crore; and Zerin Pharma, which owes Tk 423 crore. Syed Mizanur Rahman, managing director and CEO of AB Bank, acknowledged the withdrawal pressure. He said the bank is trying to manage the situation and expects the pressure to ease soon. On recovery efforts, he said the bank is working to reschedule large default loans and hopes conditions will improve. BB officials said that AB Bank’s liquidity stress stems from its massive stock of non-performing loans and the ongoing rush by depositors to pull out funds. They warned that many customers fear the bank may face the same fate as the five crisis-hit Shariah-based banks, where depositors still struggle to access their money. This fear has intensified withdrawals even further. Default loans at AB Bank climbed to over 82 per cent of its loan portfolio by the end of September, placing it among six banks where NPLs exceed 80 per cent. The bank reported Tk 30,138 crore in NPLs out of Tk 36,804 crore in total loans. Its bad loans alone stood at Tk 27,711 crore, with little chance of recovery. The deterioration has been rapid. NPLs were Tk 8,840 crore in March and Tk 8,572 crore in December 2024, showing how sharply they ballooned after regulatory scrutiny. AB Bank’s financial position has continued to decline. The bank posted Tk 3,113 crore in net losses between January and September 2025, compared with Tk 1.58 crore profit in the same period a year earlier.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/284050/ab-banks-20-defaulters-hold-50pc-of-npl", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 669},
{"title": "Mitchell ton steers New Zealand to seven-run win in first Windies ODI", "body": "A fighting Daryl Mitchell century set up a tense seven-run win for New Zealand over West Indies in the first one-day international in Christchurch on Sunday. A hobbling Mitchell struck 119 as the home side posted 269-7. The West Indies accelerated late in their chase to reach 262-6 but it was in vain. Sherfane Rutherford scored 55 and Justin Greaves an unbeaten 38 off 24 balls in the middle order but their clean hitting wasn't enough. West Indies needed 20 off the final over by seamer Jacob Duffy, and a six from Romario Shepherd (26 not out) left nine needed from the last two balls. Duffy held his nerve, putting the home side ahead in the three-match series heading into game two in Napier on Wednesday. Mitchell's innings stood out on a testing pitch as he reached a seventh ODI century despite batting a groin injury. Rachin Ravindra and Will Young fell to successive deliveries from Matthew Forde, bringing 34-year-old Mitchell -- rated the world's third best ODI batsman -- to the crease with New Zealand on 24-2. Opener Devon Conway scored 49 but the other batsmen struggled for timing apart from Mitchell, who struck many of his 12 fours and two sixes on the leg side. Mitchell's injury prevented him from fielding but he unleashed a powerful pull off seamer Jayden Seales to raise his century in the 46th over. He fell to Seales, caught in the deep in the final over. He said his 118-ball knock felt like hard work on a surface offering inconsistent bounce. ‘There wasn't a fluent way to go about your innings. You kind of had to find ways to put pressure on them and absorb pressure at other times,’ said Mitchell, who was unsure about his fitness for the rest of the series. ‘There's a little bit of a niggle there, so we'll wake up in the morning and see how that feels.’ Seales was the most successful West Indies bowler, taking 3-41. West Indies began their response cautiously, with opener Alick Athanaze (29) and Keacy Carty (32) taking 18 overs to compile their second-wicket partnership of 60. Captain Shai Hope, whose 37 gave the innings some impetus, said he wanted more from his specialist batsmen. ‘If I was to be very critical, the batters need to step up a bit more, especially at the top, myself included, I got out at a very crucial time there,’ he said. ‘A few of us need to go a bit bigger.’ Kyle Jamieson was the best of New Zealand's bowlers, taking 3-52.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/282325/mitchell-ton-steers-new-zealand-to-seven-run-win-in-first-windies-odi", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 427},
{"title": "Swiss solar furnaces recycling waste metal of watchmakers", "body": "A Swiss company inaugurated two solar furnaces on Friday in a watchmaking city, aimed at melting down and recycling the key industry’s steel offcuts by using green energy. The Jura mountains form Switzerland’s northwestern border with France, with the Swiss side home to multiple watchmaking companies and medical instrument manufacturers that use high-quality steel. The goal is to take their production waste and melt it down into ingots using concentrated solar rays—then recirculate it to companies throughout the border region via a short supply chain. ‘I’ve been dreaming of this moment for 10 years,’ said Raphael Broye, the chief executive of Panatere, which specialises in transforming and recycling metal raw materials. La Chaux-de-Fonds is the cradle of Swiss watchmaking. Panatere will continue testing with local companies before opening a factory in 2028, either on site or in the Wallis mountains in southwestern Switzerland. The company hopes to be able to produce recycled steel using solar energy on an unprecedented scale of 1,000 tonnes a year—thanks to furnaces where the temperature can approach 2,000 degrees Celsius. The site inaugurated on Friday is therefore ‘only a step’, said Broye, who nonetheless intends to demonstrate that this solar technology is not just a concept but a process that can be used in industry. Some 148 scientists and professionals worked on the first prototype. It consists of a 140-square-metre heliostat covered with movable mirrors, and a dish with a 10-metre diameter that focuses the Sun’s rays onto a crucible, where the metals are melted. In creating these prototypes, the company had to learn how to cope with the wind moving the mirrors, Saharan dust that occasionally reaches the Swiss skies, and temperatures that can drop to minus 20C in winter and exceed 30C in summer. ‘Nowadays, there is a real economic model to develop,’ Broye told reporters. ‘With the price levels and the scarcity of metals, we are able to find a position to make these projects profitable... even with Swiss wages,’ he explained, while handling shavings of copper, the price of which is skyrocketing. ‘This restores the prestige of short supply chains,’ he said, with high prices leading watchmakers and manufacturers to realise that with their production waste, they have ‘a treasure trove round the back of their factories’.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/power-energy/278049/swiss-solar-furnaces-recycling-waste-metal-of-watchmakers", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 376},
{"title": "NCT deal exceeds interim govt mandate: petitioner", "body": "The High Court on Tuesday set December 4 for delivering its verdict on a writ petition that challenged the government move to award the contract for operating the New Mooring Container Terminal to UAE-based DP World under a public-private partnership arrangement. The bench of Justice Fatema Najib and Justice Fatema Anwar set the date after hearing the public interest ligation writ petition filed by Mirza Walid Hossain, president of the Bangladesh Juba Arthanitibid Forum. Attorney general Md Asaduzzaman told reporters that the government was only holding initial discussions with a foreign company, but ‘misleading information’ was being spread that the Chattogram Port operation was being handed over under the cover of a public interest writ petition. He said that the writ petition should be rejected as premature, arguing that courts did not entertain writs at such an early stage of decision-making. ‘No final decision has been taken yet. It is still in a very primary stage,’ he said. He said critics were wrongly claiming the Chattogram Port was being sold, adding that the port and the terminal are separate, and only the terminal is being offered for operation to improve efficiency and services. The attorney general said that the government was complying with the PPP process, its rules, and the constitution. Under the constitutional provision, he added, the chief adviser and advisers can perform the functions of a prime minister and cabinet as contained in the Fourth Schedule of the constitution. Senior lawyer Ahsanul Karim, appearing for the PIL petitioner, argued that the Chattogram Port’s existing facilities could not be handed to a foreign company under the PPP framework. Only a newly built port can be operated by a foreign firm through PPP, he said. He also rejected the attorney general’s argument that all powers of an elected prime minister automatically shifted to the chief adviser of the interim government. The interim government cannot exercise powers meant for an elected government accompanied by the Jatiya Sangsad in place, he submitted. The interim government, Ahsanul argued, can only act under the doctrine of necessity, and the NCT contract is not a state necessity. He said that the issue was of public interest as all major political parties had raised concerns over it. ‘Let the elected government decide,’ he told the court, adding that the interim setup could not award such a contract in the absence of an elected authority. There is no objection to, he said, awarding a container-handling contract, but the PPP Act requirements — especially Clause 7, which defines the board of governors headed by the prime minister — must be followed. ‘There is no elected prime minister now,’ he went on to add. If the contract is given to a foreign company, the government must follow the Public Procurement Act and float an open bidding process, he added. The petitioner is not demanding that local companies must get the job, Ahsanul said, adding that rather the demand was that the law must be followed. Ahsanul argued that the interim government was simply carrying forward a process approved by the former government in 2023. But, he added, the New Mooring Container Terminal is being handed to a foreign firm in violation of Clause 7 of the PPP Act, which requires approval from a board of governors headed by a prime minister. He said that the interim government approved the project profile with an estimated cost of Tk 200 crore, although the minimum requirement was Tk 1,200 crore, calling it a legal violation. He questioned: ‘Where is the board of governors?’ The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, under the Rules of Business, does not apply to this interim government, yet PPP decisions must follow the Rules of Business, he added. Ahsanul argued that the president had formed the interim government under Article 142 of the constitution without the advice of a prime minister, invoking the doctrine of necessity. ‘But there is no such necessity to award the port contract,’ he said. Another lawyer for the petitioner Kayser Kamal argued that the Dr Muhammad Yunus-led government continued the NCT contract process only to fulfil the deposed Sheikh Hasina government’s intentions, not public interest. He said that the interim government was legitimate because all political parties supported its formation. After Sheikh Hasina fled, the army chief met all parties, and after three days of discussions they agreed on Prof Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser. The BNP, the Jamaat, and the business community, Kayser said, oppose the NCT contract. He also cited BNP acting chair Tarique Rahman’s recent newspaper remarks that the interim government could not take long-term decisions. Responding to the attorney general’s claim that the government was not giving the port but only the terminal for handling, Kayser said that the agreement would hand it over for 30 years. Besides the attorney general, additional attorney general Aneek R Haque appeared for the state while lawyer Helal Chowdhury represented the Chattogram Port Authority.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/283200/nct-deal-exceeds-interim-govt-mandate-petitioner", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 822},

In the latest case, Harsha Ilukpitiya pleaded guilty to ignoring court orders to end a multi-million dollar contract that outsourced visa services to a foreign consortium. A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court handed down the two-year sentence to Ilukpitiya — who has already spent a year in custody — for contempt. The case centred on a visa handling contract awarded by the previous government, which replaced a local provider charging one dollar per visa with a foreign consortium that raised the fee to $25. The consortium — comprising India’s GBS Technology Services and IVS Global FZCO, with VFS Global as a technology partner — even applied the fee to citizens of countries that did not need visas. Opposition parties and then-tourism minister Harin Fernando had argued the fee would discourage tourists. Petitioners alleged that the contract was not awarded transparently and estimated that the consortium stood to earn up to $2.75 billion over a 16-year period.

{"title": "Unidentified bodies signal collapse of law and order", "body": "THE sharply rising number of unidentified bodies in Dhaka and across the country is not simply crime statistics. This is a clear sign that the interim government has failed to improve law and order since the fall of Awami League regime in August 2024. The Manabadhikar Sangskriti Foundation reported that 461 unidentified bodies had been recovered in the first nine months of 2025, a sharp increase from 373 during the same period in 2024. The condition and circumstances in which bodies are recovered suggest that they were victims of targeted killings tied to economic disputes, political rivalry, business interests and personal vendettas. The frequent recovery of unidentified, decomposed bodies in public places suggests that a climate of impunity persists and is likely to take a turn towards for worse before the national elections. The home affairs adviser, however, insists that the law and order situation is improving, while the law adviser tends to shift the blame on the deposed government, saying that the politicisation of the police has created the crisis. The government should recognise that neither denial nor blaming the past regime would help to improve the situation. All kinds of crimes, from murder and robbery to sexual violence and petty crimes, are on the rise. According to police statistics, 1,336 cases of dacoity and robbery were reported across the country in the first six months of this year. During the same period, the police recorded 1,530 murder cases. In addition, 515 kidnapping cases were reported in the same period, indicating a growing threat to personal security. Political violence is still pervasive in the country, as Transparency International Bangladesh said that 121 people had been killed and 5,189 injured in 471 incidents of such violence. Of the political violence reported, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party was engaged in 92 per cent of the cases while the Awami League accounted for 22 per cent and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami for 5 per cent. Mob violence has remained a disturbing trend. In January–June, according to Ain O Salish Kendra, at least 89 people were killed in mob violence. The government’s action so far is limited to combing operations, which more often resulted in the harassment of ordinary people and an increase in arbitrary detention. The government is failing in its most basic sovereign obligation, which is to guarantee the right to life. The government must, under the circumstances, abandon its strategy of denial and do all that is necessary to improve law and order. It must ensure transparent case disclosure, rapid forensics, mandatory public reporting of the status of each unidentified body and a specialised unit focusing on daily cross-referencing of missing people and recovered bodies.

The incident is being investigated, he added. Fire Service Sadar station official Ranjit Kumar Saha said that firefighters rushed to the spot after receiving the information and brought the fire under control after about an hour of effort. The police and family members said that Belal was sleeping in the house with his wife and children when unidentified attackers locked the two doors from outside, sprinkled petrol around the house and set it on fire. At one point, sending the fire his wife darted out of the house screaming for help, but flames readily spread through the house by the time neighbours could rescue Belal and his two daughters, but failed to recover Ayesha. Ayesha died on the spot, as neighbours took the injured to Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital.

{"title": "Dengue takes alarming turn", "body": "DENGUE fever has once again reared its deadly head in Bangladesh, turning what should have been a manageable public health challenge into a national emergency. Year after year, the story repeats itself with grim familiarity — rising infection rates, overflowing hospital wards, desperate families, and belated government action. The tragedy of it all is that much of this could have been prevented. According to recent data, the first 10 months of this year alone saw over 70,000 reported dengue infections, with 278 deaths. October alone recorded a staggering 42 per cent increase in cases compared to September — a clear sign that the outbreak is spiralling beyond control. What’s worse, the figures from past years suggest that the authorities have failed to learn from experience. In 2023, Bangladesh reported over 300,000 hospitalised dengue cases and 1,705 deaths — the highest in the country’s history. In 2024, the number of infections exceeded 100,000, claiming another 575 lives. These numbers tell a story of neglect, not inevitability. For more than a decade, entomologists have been warning of the same danger: unless the breeding grounds of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary carrier of the dengue virus, are systematically destroyed before the monsoon season, outbreaks will continue to worsen. They have repeatedly emphasised that eliminating mosquito larvae is not rocket science; it is, in fact, the simplest and most effective way to control the disease. Yet, every year, the authorities wait until hospitals are overwhelmed before taking visible action — fogging machines appear on city streets, awareness campaigns are hastily launched, and political leaders issue empty assurances. By then, it is too late. The irony is that the government does conduct pre-monsoon entomological surveys each year to assess mosquito density and predict the risk of outbreaks. These surveys have consistently revealed the same findings — that water tanks, stagnant floor water and household containers such as plastic drums, flower pots and discarded tires serve as the main breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The highest concentration of Aedes larvae has been found in multi-storey buildings — particularly in urban areas like Dhaka and Chattogram, where rooftop water tanks and flower trays are left unchecked. This year’s pre-monsoon survey painted an even bleaker picture. In January, an unusually high density of mosquito larvae was detected in multiple districts. Experts sounded the alarm early, warning that unless a coordinated eradication drive was launched immediately, the country could face another devastating dengue season. Their prediction, tragically, proved right. So why does Bangladesh find itself trapped in this deadly cycle year after year? The short answer is negligence — systemic, administrative and civic. The longer answer involves a breakdown of coordination between government agencies, local authorities and the public. First, the issue of accountability. The city corporations, tasked with mosquito control, have been reactive rather than proactive. Instead of year-round monitoring, most anti-mosquito drives are launched only after dengue cases rise sharply. Public funds are spent on fogging machines that often use ineffective or expired insecticides. Worse, the fogging merely kills adult mosquitoes while leaving larvae untouched — ensuring that the next generation of mosquitoes emerges within days. Second, urban planning failure. The explosive growth of Bangladesh’s cities has created an ideal breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes. Poor drainage systems, uncollected garbage and rooftop water storage have combined into a perfect storm. Construction sites and discarded materials provide endless small pools of stagnant water. In many residential areas, there is little to no municipal monitoring to ensure proper waste management or water storage practices. Third, there is a persistent lack of public awareness and community participation. Despite repeated media campaigns, many citizens remain unaware of how their household habits contribute to dengue breeding. Old tires left in backyards, flowerpots collecting rainwater or unsealed water containers can become death traps. Dengue prevention cannot succeed through government action alone — it requires civic discipline and social responsibility. But perhaps the most alarming aspect is the absence of a long-term strategy. Bangladesh’s health sector has historically treated dengue as a seasonal nuisance rather than a permanent threat. There is no sustained investment in mosquito control infrastructure, no permanent vector surveillance system, and limited capacity for early detection. Even though dengue is now a year-round risk, most control measures disappear once the rains end. Meanwhile, neighbouring countries have demonstrated what determined public policy can achieve. Singapore, for instance, faced similar challenge decades ago but managed to bring dengue under control through an integrated approach — combining strict municipal enforcement, public education and continuous surveillance. Malaysia and Sri Lanka have also invested in data-driven dengue management systems. Bangladesh could easily adopt similar models, but political will and bureaucratic commitment remain elusive. The human cost of this failure is staggering. Behind every statistic lies a personal tragedy — a child dying in a crowded hospital ward, a family unable to find platelets for a loved one, a worker losing income due to illness. The economic toll is equally severe. The World Bank estimates that dengue outbreaks cost countries billions in lost productivity and healthcare expenses. For a developing nation like Bangladesh, the financial burden is unsustainable. The path forward demands a fundamental shift — from reaction to prevention, from temporary drives to sustained systems. Authorities must prioritise pre-monsoon mosquito eradication programmes that target larvae in high-risk areas. Local government coordination must be tightened, with transparent reporting and third-party monitoring. The health ministry should establish a national dengue control task force that works year-round, not just during crises. At the community level, awareness campaigns must move beyond slogans. Schools, workplaces and local councils should actively involve residents in weekly cleaning drives. Strict penalties should be enforced against property owners who allow breeding sites to persist. Technology can play a vital role too — smartphone-based reporting systems could enable citizens to flag potential mosquito hotspots for quick action. Finally, the crisis should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers. Climate change, urbanisation and inadequate waste management are all intensifying dengue’s spread. Without forward-looking policies, the disease could soon become endemic, straining Bangladesh’s health infrastructure beyond repair. It is not too late to change course. But time is running out. Dengue is no longer a seasonal inconvenience — it is a national emergency demanding year-round vigilance. The lesson, written in blood over the past decade, is clear: prevention delayed is disaster guaranteed. Bangladesh must act now, not when the hospitals are full and the headlines scream tragedy. The fight against dengue begins long before the monsoon — it begins with responsibility, foresight and the simple recognition that public health cannot be left to chance.

The blockade that began at about 11:30am brought traffic on the country’s busiest highway to a halt for one and a half hours, causing a 10-kilometre-long tailback from City Gate to Madam Bibir Haat. The demonstrators left the road at around 1:00pm following police intervention. More than a thousand people took part in the protest, which initially began as a sit-in on the road verge before moving onto the highway and blocking it, causing passengers and transport workers serious suffering. Chattogram Bara Aulia Highway police officer-in-charge Abdul Momin said, ‘The protesters withdrew at about 1:00pm after we had assured them that we would convey their demands to the authorities concerned.’ The demonstrators alleged that nearly 400 officials in the Chattogram region had been terminated and another 4,000–5,000 were made officers-on-special-duty, in short OSD, leaving them in hardship and uncertainty. Saifullah Bin Yousuf, who said he was an officer and got the dismissal from the bank, stated, ‘We came to the street to show how helpless 5,500 officers and employees have become. Through this peaceful programme we want to draw the attention of the chief adviser and others to resolve the crisis.’ Another dismissed officer, Khalid Hossain, said, ‘Our salary accounts have been blocked. We cannot withdraw our dues, even to meet daily household expenses.’ Earlier on Friday, a group of dismissed and OSD officials of Islami Bank at a press conference announced that they would go for continuous work abstention from Sunday. Their fresh agitation started on Saturday morning with a human chain and highway blockade. Islami Bank officials said that after S Alam’s takeover, 7,224 people were recruited from Chattogram, more than 4,500 of them from Potiya, the hometown of S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam. Recruitment bypassed competitive job exams and public advertisements, with résumés collected through drop boxes at Alam’s residence and office. As a result, the bank’s manpower rose to around 22,000 in recent years. Following the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5 last year, Islami Bank came out of the control of S Alam Group, and on September 27 this year, the bank arranged a competency assessment for 5,385 officers through the Dhaka University’s Institute of Business Administration. On September 27, however, only 414 officials appeared to take the examination. The remaining 4,971 were made OSD from the following day, alleged dismissed official Saifullah Bin Yousuf who is one of the organisers of the protesting group. Of these 4,971, about 400 officials were dismissed in two phases on charges of opposing the test and spreading confusion. The dismissed bank staff alleged that the ‘special assessment’ was part of a plan to remove several thousand employees from their jobs.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/278028/dismissed-osd-employees-of-ibbl-block-dhaka-ctg-highway", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 482},

{"title": "EU targets China imports, urging small parcel fee from 2026", "body": "The EU executive urged the bloc’s finance ministers meeting Thursday to impose a fee from next year on low-value orders from the likes of Temu and Shein to help tackle a flood of cheap Chinese imports. Today, there is no levy on packages worth less than 150 euros ($174) imported directly to consumers in the 27-nation bloc, in many cases via Chinese-founded platforms. The European Union in May this year proposed scrapping the exemption and imposing a two-euro flat fee on small packages that would apply from 2028. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic has now told EU finance ministers in a letter seen by AFP and dated Wednesday to agree on a temporary solution for next year. ‘It is a crucial step in ensuring the European Union bolsters its position in the face of rapidly changing trade realities,’ Sefcovic wrote. ‘This timeline is incompatible with the urgency of the situation,’ he added. Sefcovic said European industries, especially retailers, have stressed that ‘this distortion of competition be removed without delay’. ‘It will be extremely difficult to explain to our businesses and citizens why the EU cannot act faster to provide a solution,’ he added. The letter does not mention at what level the fee should be set, but Sefcovic said the ministers should work on a ‘simplified temporary customs fee and a better link of IT tools’. EU member states and the European Commission are expected to agree during Thursday’s talks to scrap the duty exemption and agree on finding a temporary solution for next year. In a draft statement seen by AFP that could still change, they will agree to ‘develop a simple, temporary solution to enable earlier implementation as soon as possible in 2026’ to ‘bridge the interim period’. The aim will then be to submit the plan for approval during the next meeting of EU finance ministers on December 12.

In recent weeks, the central Kordofan region — a strategic hinge between Sudan’s Darfur provinces and the Khartoum-Riverine heartland to the east — has become the latest battleground between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, locked in a brutal conflict since April 2023. An estimated 36,825 people have fled five localities in North Kordofan between October 26 and 31, the UN’s migration agency said in a statement late Sunday. Residents on Monday reported a heavy surge in both RSF and army presence across towns and villages in North Kordofan. Both the army and RSF forces are vying for El-Obeid, the North Kordofan state capital and a key logistics and command hub that links Darfur to Khartoum, and also hosts an airport. ‘Today, all our forces have converged on the Bara front here,’ an RSF member said in a video shared by the RSF late on Sunday, referring to a city north of El-Obeid. The RSF claimed control of Bara last week. Suleiman Babiker, who lives in Um Smeima, west of El-Obeid, said that following the paramilitary capture of El-Fasher, ‘the number of RSF vehicles increased’. ‘We stopped going to our farms, afraid of clashes,’ he said. Another local resident, requesting anonymity for security reasons, also said ‘there has been a big increase in army vehicles and weapons west and south of El-Obeid’ over the past two weeks. Martha Pobee, assistant UN secretary-general for Africa, raised the alarm last week about ‘large-scale atrocities’ and ‘ethnically motivated reprisals’ by the RSF in Bara. She warned of patterns echoing those in Darfur, where RSF fighters have been accused of mass killings, sexual violence and abductions against non-Arab communities after El-Fasher’s fall. The conflict has already killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/281036/thousands-flee-as-sudan-conflict-spreads-east-from-darfur", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 333},

The blockade lasted for about two hours from about 12:45pm, causing severe traffic congestion and suffering for commuters. Inspector Abdul Latif of Gazipur Industrial Police said that the authorities had promised to pay workers’ September wages on Thursday after repeatedly postponing the date earlier.

{"title": "Liverpool seek mojo against MU", "body": "Liverpool will be desperate to recapture their spark against bitter rivals Manchester United this weekend but Ruben Amorim’s men will harbour hopes of pinching a rare win at Anfield. The champions have lost just one of their past 14 Premier League meetings against United but have suffered three straight defeats in all competitions, with Arsenal now top of the pile. Nottingham Forest boss Ange Postecoglou survived the international break but remains under intense pressure after failing to record a win in his first seven matches. When Liverpool started this season with five straight Premier League wins, it appeared they were on track for a record 21st English top-flight title -- which would take them one clear of United. But problems they had papered over with a flurry of late goals finally caught up with them in defeats to Crystal Palace and Chelsea, either side of a Champions League loss at Galatasary. Liverpool, one point behind leaders Arsenal, trolled United on social media this week, reminding them of the 7-0 drubbing they dished out in March 2023. Mohamed Salah scored twice that day and has an eye-catching record against United, netting in 10 of the past 11 matches between the clubs in all competitions. But the Egypt forward will go into the fixture searching for form while new signings Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are struggling to make an impact. Arne Slot’s men are also shaky at the back. United, without a win at Anfield since 2016, have come away with creditable draws from their past two visits. Ruben Amorim’s men, wallowing in mid-table, will not scare Liverpool but they will likely have chances to exploit chinks in the home side’s armour. Ange Postecoglou does not appear to be over-concerned about his position at Nottingham Forest despite a winless start to his reign at the City Ground. The club, just one place above the relegation zone, host Chelsea in the early kick-off on Saturday. It is a rapid fall from grace for Forest, who finished seventh last season under the now-departed Nuno Espirito Santo to secure European football. But it continues a troubling pattern for Postecoglou, who endured a nightmare league campaign last season with Tottenham, which cost him his job despite Europa League glory. The Australian said he relished a challenge after his team’s 2-0 defeat at Newcastle on October 5, just days after home fans at the City Ground called for his sacking. ‘I’ve fought for things my whole life, so it’s just another fight that I love to be in the middle of,’ said the 60-year-old. Time will tell whether the international break will help Postecoglou or has merely delayed the inevitable, with former Burnley and Everton manager Sean Dyche reportedly in the frame to replace him. Antoine Semenyo is arguably the most in-form player in the Premier League, the main man in a Bournemouth team who are flying high. The London-born Ghana winger has scored six times and provided three assists in the league for Andoni Iraola’s side, who are fourth in the table after their best start to a Premier League campaign. Semenyo has been involved in nearly 82 percent of his team’s goals -- by far the highest proportion for any player in the league. ‘He is incredible,’ said teammate Justin Kluivert. ‘He shows it every game now. He is just world-class.’ Iraola’s Bournemouth are riding high despite selling around £200-million ($269-million) worth of talent in the summer transfer window. Now they a tough challenge against a Crystal Palace team determined to prove a point after the end of their 19-match unbeaten run across all competitions.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/279391/liverpool-seek-mojo-against-mu", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 601},

{"title": "Balanced, time-bound strategy needed to address NPL crisis", "body": "THE sheer scale of non-performing loans lays bare the acute distress confronting the banking sector, in particular, and the economy, in general. After tighter inspections and stricter classification rule enforcement, the Bangladesh Bank reports that Tk 6.45 lakh crore, about 36 per cent of total outstanding loans, has become defaulted by September. State-owned banks carry the heaviest burden, with nearly a half of their portfolios now in default. Private commercial banks are not far behind, with 34 per cent of outstanding loans being in default. The magnitude of accumulated losses threatens investment, job creation and economic stability. The alarming figure also confirms what has for long been suspected that years of regulatory forbearance, data manipulation and politically influenced lending masked the depth of the crisis. Toxic assets have nearly tripled in a year as previously concealed defaults surface under tightened rules. The sector was riddled with systemic corruption and undue political interference during the Awami League regime. Large sums were syphoned off through fictitious and fraudulent accounts while many loans were falsely reported as ‘regular’ through deliberate data manipulation. Lenient policies that allowed repeated rescheduling aggravated the problem. When the Awami League assumed office in 2009, non-performing loans stood at Tk 22,481 crore. While the central bank’s adoption of international standards, by shortening the default recognition period from 270 days to 90 days, has helped to expose the scale of the crisis, the surge in non-performing loans cannot be attributed to definitional changes alone. Many enterprises tied to the previous political nexus have, since the fall of the Awami League regime, scaled-back operation or halted repayment entirely, accelerating the jump in non-performing loans. Moreover, recent political unrest and an economic slowdown have added to repayment pressure for many enterprises, especially small and medium. All this, therefore, requires a credible and well-designed action plan from the authorities. The interim government has taken some steps to stabilise the sector, but the scale of the damage demands more than administrative tightening. Experts note that recovery efforts will continue to fall short unless the entrenched culture of impunity is decisively broken. Taxpayers may once again have to shoulder the burden when state banks seek recapitalisation. While stringent measures are essential to hold wilful defaulters accountable and ensure recovery, borrowers who have defaulted because of genuine financial hardship, political unrest or economic stagnation should be treated differently to avoid further erosion of productive capacity.

{"title": "Zionism on Upper East Side", "body": "WE WATCH in horror from afar as the Zionist terror state continues its genocide against the people of Gaza and escalates its slower-motion, lower-technology genocide against the three million Palestinians who reside in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, otherwise known as the Occupied Territories — illegally occupied, of course. As a few Israeli commentators have pointed out — those few who guard their integrity — the operative principle here is the limitless impunity the Western powers have long granted ‘the Jewish state.’ This is the outcome, they say, when a people given to a culture of vengeance are told they will never suffer consequences however barbaric their conduct toward others, however many laws they break, however many their assassinations, however many their torture victims, however many exploding telephones they plant among civilian populations, etc. Maybe we need no reminders, maybe we do, that this presumption of impunity is not bound by sovereign borders and is not limited to the cowardly, condemnable savagery of apartheid Israel in Gaza and the West Bank. But we had one last week, and it is well we consider it carefully. Zohran Mamdani, the principled social democrat who is New York’s mayor-elect, is now under attack from Zionist Americans who insist Zionist Americans are above the law — American law and international law. You may look well on Mamdani and you may not, but as he is besieged by these objectionable people, so are we all. This story begins on November 19, at Park East Synagogue, a grand edifice that sits on East 67th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues in the Lenox Hill section of Manhattan. Park East has been serving Modern Orthodox Jews since 1890. Its congregation, to be noted, is comprised of the great and good of the Upper East Side. These are observant but assimilated Jews, thoroughly plugged into, let’s say, secular public space. Two Wednesdays back Park East hosted an organisation dedicated to encouraging Jews to ‘make Aliyah,’ the Hebrew term for emigrating to ‘the Promised Land.’ OK, you cannot find anything legally wrong in this, although it is unambiguously a moral wrong in that it expresses support for a genocidal state. But let us set aside the moral question for now. The organisation Park East sponsored, Nefesh B’Nefesh, also assists American Jews who wish to emigrate to Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories. This is a legal matter and as such not inconsequential. STATISTICS on the settler population in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are hard to nail down (and I can easily imagine why). The Times of Israel reported eight years ago that some 60,000 Americans were among the Jewish settlers in the West Bank. That was roughly 15 percent of the settler population then — not counting the considerable number residing in East Jerusalem. We have no precise figures now, but these populations — settlers and Americans among the settlers — are both higher. As has been well-reported, and well-recorded in several documentaries, the Americans among the West Bank settlers are frequently the most violent in their incessant attacks on Palestinians. They have also been at times the most readily inclined to murder. There is the infamous case of Baruch Goldstein, a freakshow Zionist from Brooklyn who killed 29 Palestinians when he attacked the Ibrahimi Mosque (tomb of Abraham and other patriarchs) in Hebron in 1994. Goldstein was not singular: He was and remains exemplary — and a hero among some Zionists. National Security Minister Ben Givr had a picture of Goldstein on his living room wall until 2020. I cannot name the precise statutes applicable here, but they must be several. Open and shut, just the facts, Ma’am, Nefesh B’Nefesh is an accomplice to the settler movement. Most immediately significant in the Park East case, Nefesh B’Nefesh — this translates as ‘soul to soul,’ and who knows what that is all about — is directly implicated in the settlers’ breach of international law given that all the settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal according to said law. There was no claiming surprise that blustery Nov. 19th when a group of roughly 200 vociferous demonstrators gathered in front of Park East to protest the promotional seminar Nefesh B’Nefesh was running that day. ‘Death to the IDF’ was among the tamer of various chants; others encouraged violence against settlers. ‘It is our duty,’ one leader of the demonstration said measuredly to those assembled, ‘to make them think twice before holding these events.’ Inside the Park East building, people indirectly but unmistakably promoting violence against Palestinians, land theft and all the rest. And on East 67th Street, righteous indignation, anger in behalf of a persecuted people, some violent rhetoric, but no violence. It was obvious the mayor-elect would have to intervene. The event itself warranted this, and various Zionist constituencies, as well-reported before and since Mamdani’s election, have been attacking him as a radical jihadist, an anti–Semite and who knows what else, so attempting to poison his relations with New York’s Jewish community. Here is the ever-poised Mamdani’s day-after statement, his first on the incident: ‘The mayor-elect has discouraged the use of language used at last night’s protest and will continue to do so. He believes every New Yorker should be free to enter a house of worship without intimidation and that these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.’ A few days later, storms of protest from Zionist quarters having instantly erupted, Mamdani sent this statement to The New York Times: ‘We will protect New Yorkers’ First Amendment rights while making clear that nothing can justify language calling for “death to” anyone. It is unacceptable, full stop.’ I find these statements a little in the way of Solomon in their discernment, in Mamdani’s determination not to tilt his hand and to articulate the core truth of the matter: The more extreme language out on East 67th Street was wrong so far as it intimidated synagogue goers, but the principle of free speech is nonetheless to be honored; those encouraging breaches of international law are wrong, and a synagogue should not be used to promote illegalities. MAYBE what has come back at Mamdani in the course of all this was predictable, more-of-the-same babble. ‘Mob’ was the de rigueur term among those responding to the mayor-elect’s response. The demonstrators were ‘a hateful mob of anti–Israel protesters,’ the New York Post reported, and it got worse from there. Mamdani sided with ‘an anti–Semitic mob,’ eJP, or eJewishphilanthropy.com, declared. ‘Last week,’ this outfit continued, ‘Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani failed the first test of his promise to protect all New Yorkers.’ And from William Daroff, the chief exec of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations: ‘We are still judging him, and I’d say that at the moment he’s got a failing grade.’ They sitteth in judgment, you see. OK, we have heard all this before in one or another context, so has Mamdani. He is surely in for more of same once he assumes office January 1. But we ought not miss the very much larger matters raised by the Park East incident. There is the First Amendment question, as Mamdani correctly noted, and there are the legal questions as pencil-sketched above. These are related at the not-too-distant horizon. People speaking for Nefesh B’Nefesh now deny they promote emigration to West Bank settlements — which, as the group’s website attests, is simply not true. It advertises Gush Etzion, an expanding sprawl of 22–and-counting settlements south of Jerusalem, Ma‘ale Adumim, whose location makes it key to the Israelis final takeover of the West Bank, and various others. ‘Teaching about Aliyah and Zionism belongs in that space’: This is the aforementioned William Daroff. And from eJP again: ‘Mamdani condemned the synagogue’s choice of programming.’ Choice of programming. You see what is going on here. Park East and Nefesh B’Nefesh are encouraging Americans to breach international law. And absolutely to a one, those defending the synagogue and the event-organiser do so by pretending this is not what is most pithily at issue. ‘We are deeply concerned by, and firmly condemn, the violent rhetoric and aggressive behaviour that took place outside of the Park East Synagogue,’ Nefesh B’Nefesh now declares on its website. Violent rhetoric and aggressive behaviour on East 67th Street but not in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem. To go straight to the point, this is another assertion of Zionist impunity. And we should understand what has lately transpired in New York as a very, very direct extension of the impunity that encourages and also protects the Israeli terror machine in Gaza and the West Bank. Impunity: It is a blight under which Palestinians suffer, and none of us is immune to it. To put this another way, we witness an especially insidious case of chutzpah, the dangers of which I have considered elsewhere. You have your laws, the world has its, and we will ignore them before your eyes (and ostracise you as an anti–Semite if you object). This, in a sentence, is what Zionists now insist we must accept. I do not know what I would have chanted were I among the 200 outside Park East Synagogue the evening of November 19. I know what I would have wanted to hear from those inside: I would have wanted every right-thinking congregant at Park East to emerge denouncing Zionism as a blight on the splendour of Judaism’s authentic traditions — this and loud denunciation of all that Israel’s impunity licenses it to do more or less everywhere.

{"title": "Govt fails to contain extortion, says adviser", "body": "Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Tuesday said that the interim government had failed to curb extortions that upped the prices of essentials in Bangladesh. He also revealed that a portion of the stolen money abroad was expected to be brought back by February. The finance adviser’s remarks came while talking to reporters at his secretariat office. He admitted that the extent of extortion had gone up in the country after August 5, 2024. On August 5, 2024, the Awami League regime was ousted amid a mass uprising, paving the way for the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus to assume office on August 8, 2024. Noting that extortion has increased to Tk 1.5 from previous Tk 1 in the current regime, the finance adviser said that curbing extortion without political commitment and the political government was impossible. He also said that many new parties had engaged in extortion after August 5, 2024. Besides, the parties which were active in rent seeking before August 5, 2025 have still been active, he said, revealing that many extortionists were members of business organisations too. The finance adviser said that extortion caused prices of essentials to spiral though his ministry was not responsible for controlling their prices. The finance adviser who talked to reporters at his ministry for about half an hour said that the interim government would be able to recover by February a portion of the money smuggled out of the country during the AL regime. He, however, did not disclose the amount. About $234 billion was siphoned off from Bangladesh between 2009 and 2023, according to the white paper on the state of the economy. As per the paper, the laundered money was sent to -- or routed primarily through -- the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and India as well as a number of tax havens. The finance adviser said that the interim government had been giving high priority to 10 to 12 cases and medium priority to around 200 cases linked to smuggling of Tk 200 crore each. Discussions with many legal firms have been going on, he said, hoping that a portion might be recovered by next February. He also said that they were doing the groundwork for recovering the other portions.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/277653/govt-fails-to-contain-extortion-says-adviser", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 383},
{"title": "Spain’s Benidorm embraces its Franco-era mass tourism model", "body": "Fifty years after General Francisco Franco’s death, Benidorm still clings to the mass tourism model it pioneered under his dictatorship, even as protests against overtourism sweep other Spanish holiday hotspots. Built on bikinis, skyscrapers and package holidays, the industry reshaped socially conservative Spain’s image abroad and brought in much-needed foreign currency. ‘There are no car factories here, no soap factories. What we have is a factory of hotels, restaurants and businesses that make our visitors happy,’ said Angela Barcelo, 72, the owner of the Hotel Les Dunes in the Mediterranean beach resort. Her grandmother opened it in 1957, when Spanish women needed their husband’s permission to open a bank account. ‘What Benidorm is today is thanks to the women,’ Barcelo said, recalling how local men were often away at sea while women managed the family assets and opened many of the first hotels and guesthouses. A former seafaring village of whitewashed houses and just 3,000 residents, Benidorm has mushroomed into a city of more than 100 skyscrapers whose population swells to 4,00,000 on peak August days. This transformation was the work of Pedro Zaragoza Orts, Benidorm’s mayor from 1950 to 1966 and an enthusiastic supporter of the ultranationalist Falange movement that backed Franco’s rule. He saw foreign tourism as a safer alternative to seafaring, which had claimed the lives of many of his relatives, or farming. When foreign women began arriving on the beaches in bikinis, Spain’s influential Catholic Church, which was closely aligned with the dictatorship, pushed back. The bishop of the nearby city of Alicante clashed with Zaragoza, who faced the threat of excommunication, which carried significant social stigma at the time. Franco himself tipped the scales when he sent his wife and daughter to holiday several times at Zaragoza’s home in Benidorm — a gesture widely seen as a blessing. Zaragoza was also very socially conservative but he realised Spain needed to open up, historian Francisco Amillo, 76, who has lived in Benidorm for decades, told AFP. ‘The income from foreign currency multiplied exponentially’ once bikinis were allowed on beaches, he added. Zaragoza proved adept at publicity stunts, inviting a family of the Sami people from Finland’s Arctic region for a holiday that drew Nordic media coverage. He also launched the Benidorm Song Festival, where Grammy Award-winning Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias began his career. By the early 1960s, gay bars also appeared in the town, offering a refuge during Franco’s authoritarian rule. Zaragoza’s model of selling sea and sun worked and was extended to other parts of Spain, which received some 94 million foreign visitors last year, making it the world’s second most-visited country behind France. Some 2.8 million of those foreign tourists headed to Benidorm, packing its seven kilometres (four miles) of wide, sandy beaches. Criticised for decades for its high-rise skyline and dense crowds, in recent years it has been hailed as a model of sustainable tourism. Concentrated housing occupies less land, minimises water loss, allows for quicker waste collection and reduces the need for cars, said the deputy chief engineer at Benidorm’s city council, Vicente Mayor. ‘Although tall buildings and urban density have been looked down upon, vertical growth is a very efficient model,’ he added. Visitors remain loyal. ‘It’s got something for everybody. It’s brilliant. It’s got the bars, the madness down the strip. And it’s got lovely tapas bars in the old town,’ said Stuart Reed who was visiting with his wife from Britain. Others bristle at its reputation. ‘When I tell friends I’m going to Benidorm, they say: ‘What a horrible city!’’ said Maribel Soler, a 68-year-old Frenchwoman. ‘But that’s because they don’t know it. They’ve never been. They only judge the buildings,’ added Soler, who compared Benidorm to New York. ‘And I love New York,’ she said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/278872/spains-benidorm-embraces-its-franco-era-mass-tourism-model", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 627},
{"title": "‘Dangerous’ Odegaard has freedom to shine", "body": "Mikel Arteta said his decision to give Martin Odegaard ‘total freedom’ has helped the Arsenal captain after he starred in Wednesday’s 2-0 win over Olympiakos. Back in the starting line-up after a spell on the sidelines with a shoulder injury, Odegaard made up for lost time with an influential display against Olympiakos as Arsenal extended their perfect start to the Champions League. The Norway midfielder was the catalyst for Gabriel Martinelli’s 12th-minute opener before his deft ball into Bukayo Saka produced the Gunners’ second goal in stoppage time. ‘Martin has all the license in the world to go forward. To play with that freedom and that level of threat,’ Arteta said. ‘Not only with the passes but the way he was taking the ball, carrying the ball, making runs, he was really dangerous. ‘He should have scored a goal today. Great to have him back. He played some good minutes to help us win at Newcastle on Sunday as well.’ Arsenal are at their best when Odegaard leads their pressing game high up the pitch, while sparking their attacks with his intelligent passing and movement. Arteta believes Odegaard’s qualities are perfectly matched with the high octane pace provided on the flanks by Martinelli, Saka, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke. ‘We have to play with our qualities and when we have a front three with that pace we have to do that 100 percent,’ Arteta said. ‘That creativity part is his nature. It doesn’t bring any extra pressure to him. It is his best ability. Not a lot of players can do it. It is his nature. ‘He has total freedom from me to explore and feel the movement in the spaces. He has certainly done that in the last few games.’ With Madueke currently injured and Saka working his way back to full fitness after a hamstring problem, Arteta was able to turn to Martinelli and Leandro Trossard as his wingers. That strength in depth -- bolstered by a summer spending spree on new signings -- was a far cry from the problems Arteta faced during the latter stages of last season, when injuries dented Arsenal’s bids to win the Premier League and Champions League. ‘With all respect last season I was looking and we had five academy players that had never played professional football in the Champions League last season. So yeah it makes a difference,’ Arteta said. ‘Today I changed six players because I want everyone to feel involved and feel part of it. It was great. ‘Physically we were dropping because we played a really intense match at Newcastle. The ones who came in lifted the level and helped us win today.’ Arteta said the ability to keep key players like Saka fresh will be especially vital as his side chase their first English title since 2004 and a maiden Champions League crown. ‘Especially with Bukayo, he came from a long-term injury, he played 46, 60 and 70 minutes in a short space of time, so it was more risky,’ he said. ‘We decided to play Gabby instead. It is great to have someone like him coming in with a different profile. He performed really well.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/277846/dangerous-odegaard-has-freedom-to-shine", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 529},
{"title": "2,936 to get 73.40 tonne of rice during hilsa ban in Khulna", "body": "The government has planned to distribute 73.40 tonnes of VGF rice among 2,936 registered fishermen to help cover family expenses during the 22-day hilsa catching ban period. Earlier, the government announced a ban on catching, selling, transporting and hoarding hilsa to increase its production and preserve mother hilsa during the breeding season. The ban is effective from 12:01am on Saturday and will be lifted on October 25. As the annual breeding season of hilsa approaches with the full moon of Ashwin, rivers across the country are expected to fill with shimmering waves of the national fish migrating from the sea to spawn. To protect brood hilsa during this critical time, the government has once again imposed a 22-day ban on catching, transporting and marketing the fish. In Khulna district alone, there are 2,936 registered fishermen who depend entirely on hilsa fishing for their livelihood. Many of them say that they are already in debt as they could not catch enough fish even during the peak season. With the ban now in force, fishermen fear falling deeper into financial hardship and have urged the authorities to distribute the allocated rice quickly. According to the District Fisheries Office, hilsa is caught in 20 rivers of Khulna, including the Pashur, Shibsa, Bhadra, Dhaki, Chunkuri, Jhappjhopia, Kazibacha, Shailmari, Gengrail, Hari, Deluti, Habrakhana, Bhairab, Rupsha, Atai, Mojudkhali, Kapotaksha, Koyra, and Shekherbaria. Over 3,600 fishermen in these rivers are engaged exclusively in hilsa fishing. District fisheries officer Md Badruzzaman said, ‘In Dighalia, Terokhada, Batiaghata, Dacope, Paikgacha and Dumuria, there are 3,601 hilsa fishermen. This year, 2,936 fishermen from six upazilas, excluding Dumuria, will receive 73.40 tonnes of VGF rice assistance. Each registered fisherman will get 25 kilograms of rice.’ He added that the rice distribution was scheduled to be completed by October 12. ‘During the ban, no one is allowed to catch, transport, market, or store hilsa. Strict monitoring and mobile court drives will be conducted to ensure full compliance,’ the official warned. Khulna deputy commissioner Md Toufiqur Rahman has instructed all upazila nirbahi officers to complete the distribution of VGF rice to eligible fishermen within the stipulated time under the Humanitarian Assistance Programme (2012-2013 guidelines). The directive also states that each UNO must issue delivery orders to respective union parishad chairmen within two working days of receiving sub-allocation and prepare the distribution schedule accordingly. The presence of the upazila fisheries officer or their representative, along with the designated tag officer, is mandatory during rice distribution. Authorities have been cautioned to ensure that no one other than registered fishermen receives the VGF allocation.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/278119/2936-to-get-7340-tonne-of-rice-during-hilsa-ban-in-khulna", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 427},

A visit to the riverbanks revealed a scene that hardly reflects a fishing ban rather, it looks like a hilsa harvest festival. Despite the ongoing restriction, hundreds of fishermen were seen casting nets at over 50 points along the Padma in both districts. Many said that they were forced to risk fines as they had not yet received the promised government support. ‘Even though I have a fisher’s card, I have not received any rice from the government this season,’ said Saifullah, a fisherman from North Channel union in Faridpur, adding, ‘We were promised 25 kilograms of rice but those who got aid received no more than 20 kilograms.’ Several fishermen said that despite having official registration, they were yet to get the full government allowance, forcing them to return to the river to meet family needs and repay loans taken for repairing boats and nets. According to the Fisheries Department, 8,012 registered fishermen in Faridpur and Rajbari depend directly on hilsa fishing while at least another 5,000 rely on the trade for their livelihood. District administrations have been conducting mobile court drives to enforce the ban. Faridpur senior fisheries officer Prashanta Kumar Sardar said, ‘We are conducting regular mobile court drives to ensure compliance with the government’s ban on hilsa fishing.

The commission issued a gazette on Wednesday finalising the revised boundaries of the four seats. According to the gazette, Pabna-1, constituency no-68, now comprises Santhia upazila and parts of Bera upazila, including Bera municipality and the unions of Haturia Nakalia, Natun Varenga, Chakla and Kaitola. Pabna-2, constituency no-69, includes Sujanagar upazila and the remaining areas of Bera upazila, excluding Bera municipality and the four unions—Haturia Nakalia, Natun Varenga, Chakla and Kaitola. Faridpur-2, constituency no-212, now consists of Nagarkanda upazila and Saltha upazila. Faridpur-4, constituency no-214, has now included Bhanga upazila, Charbhadrasan upazila and Sadarpur upazila. Before the latest revision, Pabna-1 comprises only Santhia upazila, while Pabna-2 included Sujanagar and Bera upazilas. Faridpur-2 previously covered Nagarkanda, Saltha and two unions—Algi and Hamirdi—of Bhanga upazila, while Faridpur-4 consisted of Bhanga upazila, excluding Algi and Hamirdi unions, Charbhadrasan and Sadarpur upazilas.

{"title": "Floating wind power sets sail in Japan’s energy shift", "body": "Close to a small fishing port in southwestern Japan, the slim white turbines of the country’s first commercial-scale floating wind farm glimmer offshore, months before a key project in Tokyo’s green-energy strategy begins. Still heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has declared offshore wind energy a ‘trump card’ in its drive to make renewables its top power source by 2040, and reach carbon neutrality a decade later. That’s despite rising project costs and fears over inadequate infrastructure to produce turbines en masse. Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters. ‘Floating structures are relatively stable even in the case of earthquakes or typhoons,’ said Kei Ushigami, head of marine renewable energy for construction company Toda, a key player in the project. The eight turbines — sitting five kilometres (three miles) off the coast of the Goto Islands in waters up to 140 metres deep — will officially start turning in January. It’s hoped they’ll aid the archipelago in reaching ambitious new targets laid out this year that should see wind’s contribution to the energy mix soar to between four and eight per cent by 2040 — up from around one per cent today. But it’s a long, hard road ahead for resource-scarce Japan — the world’s fifth-largest carbon dioxide emitter — to wean itself off fossil fuels. In 2024, 65 per cent of its electricity needs were met by coal and hydrocarbon-powered thermal plants, while just over a quarter came from renewables, according to Japan’s Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies. Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable. Other project operators have asked for better support from the government. ‘It is important for the government to address shortcomings in the current bidding system, which failed to anticipate rapid global inflation after bids were awarded,’ said Yoko Mulholland from the think tank E3G. The streamlining of regulatory processes and easing construction restrictions would ‘shorten lead times and also lower capital expenditure’, she told AFP. Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan’s vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres. The task, however, appears Herculean: to meet the 2040 wind target, around 200 15-megawatt turbines a year need to go up. But ‘the infrastructure is not yet in place’, warned Yonekura. ’Japan lacks turbine manufacturers and large production sites.’ Construction companies also face technical challenges with these still-novel systems: defects discovered in the floating structure of a wind turbine at Goto meant Toda had to make replacements, delaying the project by two years. Coexistence with local industries, especially fishing, is also crucial. Toda said it had conducted an environmental assessment and found a pilot project had ‘no negative impact on fish’. Fishermen also receive part of the revenue from electricity sales and some of the property taxes generated by the project, while some have been hired to monitor the construction site with their vessels. But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ‘from the top’ and presented as ‘a done deal’.

{"title": "Man hacked to death in Lakshmipur", "body": "A man was hacked to death at his home at Ramganj upazila in Lakshmipur late on Monday, eight days after a Bangladesh Nationalists Party activist was killed in a separate attack in the same upazila. Police identified the victim as Hasmat Ullah, 70, of Bashghar village under ward 2 of Ramganj municipality in Lakshmipur. Hasmat’s elder son, Shahin Hossain, alleged that his cousins Md Tofayel, 37, and Md Mohan, 34, along with municipal Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal member Md Suman Chowdhury, 45, and eight to nine others attacked to forcibly seize the family’s house at about 11:00pm. The attackers beat Hasmat when he and other family members resisted Tofayel and Mohan who allegedly were accompanied by hired men to carry out the assault. Hasmat’s family took him to the Ramganj Upazila Health Complex in a critical condition, where doctors declared him dead. Police said the two prime suspects, Tofayel and Mohan, fled immediately after the attack. Agitated local people in the area on Tuesday morning removed furniture from the suspects’ houses and set them on fire. Local residents later recovered several sharp weapons from a garden adjacent to the suspects’ house and police collected them. Officer in-charge of Ramganj Police Station Mohammad Abdul Bari said that the body was sent to Lakshmipur Sadar Hospital for post-mortem examination and that the filing of a case was under process. Police said an investigation was under way regarding the killing. The killing comes just over a week after BNP activist and tea stall owner Anwar Hossain was hacked to death on November 24 in Shaharpara village of Bholakot union, allegedly for failing to pay money demanded by ward-level Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal leader Md Yusuf.

{"title": "Election-related spending to add burden: GED", "body": "Election-related spending and possible disruptions during following the election are expected to add further pressure on the country’s inflation and foreign exchange market, complicating stabilisation efforts, according to the latest Economic Update and Outlook for November 2025 prepared by the General Economics Division. The report warned that large-scale dollar purchases by the central bank unless sterilised could fuel inflation and distort market-based exchange rate mechanisms. Bangladesh’s economic recovery depended heavily on political stability following the February national election and the next government’s willingness to carry out meaningful reforms, said the GED report. According to the report, rice contributed about 47 per cent of total food inflation in October, while vegetables posted a strong negative impact because of seasonal abundance. Overall inflation dropped to 8.17 per cent in October 2025, from 10.87 per cent a year earlier, driven almost entirely by a sharp fall in food inflation. Food inflation plunged from 12.66 per cent in October 2024 to 7.08 per cent in October 2025 as rice supply improved due to the Aman harvest, imports and public procurement. However, non-food inflation inched up to 9.13 per cent, reflecting persistent pressure in housing, transport and healthcare — an indication that inflation remains far from under control. The report offered a cautiously optimistic view but warned that deep structural weaknesses along with the political transition period could constrain economic momentum. According to analysis, the economy could regain pace if the election produced a clear political direction and the next government decisively undertook long-delayed reforms, particularly in improving the business climate, stabilising the banking system and ensuring fiscal and energy security. Without such reforms, the recovery may be short-lived, it said. The Asian Development Bank has forecast about 5 per cent GDP growth for the 2025-26 financial year following a sluggish period. Remittances and garment exports continue to provide much-needed resilience, but the GED noted that the broader economic environment remained fragile as both investors and entrepreneurs appear to be ‘waiting’ for political stability before committing to new ventures. While bank deposits grew at nearly double-digit rates through August and September, private-sector credit growth fell to just 6.29 per cent — the lowest in at least four years and well below the Bangladesh Bank’s FY26 target of 7.2 per cent. High lending rates, cautious bank behaviour and political uncertainty have depressed investment appetite. Meanwhile, government borrowing from commercial banks surged 24.45 per cent in September, raising concerns about crowding out private borrowers. Interest rate spreads also exposed deep structural distortions. Foreign commercial banks maintained spreads close to 9 per cent, far higher than state-owned and private banks, highlighting issues such as high operational costs, non-performing loans and market concentration. Revenue collection in October 2025 fell short of the target by Tk 8,324 crore, achieving only 77.37 per cent of the month’s goal. All major revenue streams — import duties, domestic VAT and income tax — underperformed. Foreign exchange reserves improved significantly, rising from $24.35 billion in November 2024 to $32.34 billion in October 2025. BPM6 reserves also rose sharply, supported by stronger remittances and prudent reserve management. Remittances surged in the first four months of FY26, with each month outperforming the previous year and September recording the highest inflows. However, export earnings remained volatile. Exports peaked in July at $4.77 billion but suffered sharp declines in April and June.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/283877/election-related-spending-to-add-burden-ged", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 554},

{"title": "India prosecuting Muslims for saying ‘I Love Muhammad’ sparks outrage", "body": "The Modi-led BJP regime in India has launched a sweeping crackdown on Muslims across several states for displaying or posting the slogan ‘I Love Muhammad’ in honour of Prophet Muhammad, with more than 2,500 people charged and dozens arrested, reported Al Jazeera. According to Kashmir Media Service, police in BJP-ruled states, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttarakhand and occupied Jammu and Kashmir, have raided homes and markets, arrested Muslim men, and even bulldozed their houses — all for expressing devotion to the Prophet through posters, t-shirts, or social media posts. The campaign began in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, when Muslims displayed illuminated ‘I Love Muhammad’ boards during Eid Milad-un-Nabi. On the complaints of Hindutva goons, police registered cases on charges of ‘promoting enmity on religious grounds,’ which carry up to five years’ imprisonment. Protests soon spread to several other states after the arrests, leading to violent police crackdowns and further detentions. In Bareilly, police arrested 75 people, including prominent cleric Tauqeer Raza, and demolished several houses without court orders. Legal experts and rights defenders cited by Al Jazeera said the expression ‘I Love Muhammad’ is not illegal under India’s constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion and expression under Articles 25 and 19(1)(a). The Association for Protection of Civil Rights said authorities were misusing laws to criminalise Muslim identity. Amnesty International described the campaign as ‘a deeply troubling precedent,’ warning that India’s targeting of peaceful religious expression violates both constitutional and international human rights standards. Critics said the crackdown reflects the BJP’s long-running pattern of weaponising law against Muslims since Narendra Modi took power in 2014, while promoting majoritarian narratives that equate Islamic devotion with public disorder.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/279808/india-prosecuting-muslims-for-saying-i-love-muhammad-sparks-outrage", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 276},

{"title": "Indian man obtains Bangladeshi citizenship using false identity", "body": "An Indian citizen from Murshidabad district of West Bengal has allegedly obtained Bangladeshi citizenship using false information. Local residents said that the man, identified in India as Saher Ali Sardar, 38, obtained a Bangladeshi birth registration in March 2020 and a national identity card in July 2022 under the name Md Akash Pramanik. They said that Saher came to Bangladesh several years ago to visit relatives and never returned. He later concealed his identity, married at Dhopapara under Puthia upazila in Rajshahi, and managed to obtain the Bangladeshi documents. Saher, son of Sohrab Sardar of Bantai Dangapara Sani Mandir area in Murshidabad, changed his name and address to secure Bangladeshi citizenship. The matter has come to light recently when Asma Begum, listed as his mother in his Bangladeshi NID, filed a complaint with the Rajshahi district administration, demanding cancellation of his citizenship. According to his Indian unique identification card (ID number 339991663915), Saher Ali was born on January 1, 1988. In Bangladeshi documents, Akash Pramanik’s birth certificate (No 1998811820415762) lists his date of birth as January 15, 1990, and his address as Dhopapara village at Puthia upazila in Rajshahi. Asma told New Age that they had taken Saher in about seven years ago when he claimed to be homeless. ‘Later, I found that he used my and my husband’s national ID information to make his own under a false name. He even married here. I want him sent back to his own country,’ she said. She added that Saher had used her name to register a SIM card and apply for official documents. Contacted, Saher admitted that he is an Indian citizen but denied the allegations of wrongdoing by himself in obtaining Bangladeshi documents, claiming that Asma and her husband had arranged all the documents for him. ‘I was an orphan, and they took me in. I did not commit any fraud,’ he said, adding that Asma and her husband forced him out of their house four years ago after a family dispute. He said that he had obtained a Bangladeshi NID card several years ago and a passport that he used to travel abroad.

{"title": "NBR Revenue collection falls short of target by Tk 24,000c", "body": "Bangladesh’s revenue collection witnessed a year-on-year growth of 15.15 per cent in the July-November period of the financial year 2025-26 to Tk 148,975 crore, higher from Tk 129,380 crore collected in the same period of FY25, according to National Board of Revenue data. However, revenue collection fell short by Tk 24,047 crore of the target set at Tk 173,242 crore. In a single month, November 2025, revenue collection also grew by 14.2 per cent to Tk 29,659 crore, up from Tk 25,970 crore collected in November 2024. The collection in November also fell short of its target by Tk 6,667 crore, set at Tk 36,926.49 crore, according to NBR data. During the July-November period of FY26, customs collections stood at Tk 42,864 crore, 5.28 per cent higher than the Tk 40,713 crore collected in the first five months of FY25. However, the revenue collection from customs missed the target of Tk 50,980 crore by over Tk 8,100 crore. Revenue collection from the VAT section was Tk 58,231 crore in the first five months of FY26, which was 21.97 per cent higher than the Tk 47,744 crore collected in the same period of the previous financial year, though the section also missed its target of Tk 62,049 crore. Fetching a growth of 17 per cent, revenue collection from the income tax sector stood at Tk 47,881 crore in the July-November period of FY26, up from Tk 40,922 crore in the corresponding period of FY25, the NBR data stated. Collections from the income tax sector also fell short of the target by over Tk 12,000 crore, to Tk 59,995 crore. Still, revenue collected from indirect sources was higher than that from direct sources in July-October of FY26, according to NBR data. An NBR official said that the government set a highly ambitious target for FY26, so the collection from the first five months of FY26 was nothing special. For FY26, the government set a revenue collection target of Tk 4,99,000 crore through the NBR, which was about 8 per cent of the total GDP. To reach the target, Bangladesh needs to collect approximately Tk 40,000 crore in revenue per month. However, the NBR official expressed hope that the gap between targets and collections will be narrower this year, as the NBR has expanded its workforce by increasing tax zones nationwide, along with some policies on automation and online tax filing. Stakeholders always stated that Bangladesh has been struggling to finance project developments amid a persistently low tax-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest globally. In FY25, the NBR faced a record revenue collection shortfall of Tk 92,625, after collecting Tk 3,70,874 crore, which was about 3.08 per cent lower than the Tk 3,82,678 crore collected in FY24. In FY25, the revised revenue collection target was Tk 4,63,500 crore. Recently, NBR chairman Abdur Rahman Khan said that Bangladesh’s tax-GDP ratio remained low, and more research is needed to identify why specific segments of the economy remain untaxed. As the country prepares for LDC graduation, import duties would inevitably decline due to global trade obligations, making a stronger domestic tax base essential, he said.

The call was made at a discussion meeting organised in the capital’s Krishibid Institution on Tuesday marking World Standards Day 2025. The Day is being observed this year under the theme ‘A Shared Vision for a Better World: Standards for Sustainable Development’. Industries secretary Md Obaidur Rahman attended the event as the chief guest while BSTI Director General SM Ferdous Alam chaired the session. Among others, former secretary and president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh AHM Shafiquzzaman, chairman and CEO of PRAN-RFL Group Ahsan Khan Chowdhury and FBCCI’s head of international affairs Md Zafar Iqbal were present. The keynote paper was presented by Professor Abdul Hasib Chowdhury, pro-vice chancellor of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. In his address, Industries Secretary Md. Obaidur Rahman said that ensuring quality standards is not the lone responsibility of an institution alone, rather it requires joint efforts from producers, regulators, and consumers. ‘BSTI has evolved into a globally recognized institution in many areas. It now houses several laboratories, including the National Halal Laboratory, that meet international standards,’ he said urging the businesses to maintain quality even after obtaining BSTI licenses. Calling upon entrepreneurs, he said, ‘Ethical production and marketing of quality goods must continue throughout the year-not just during Ramadan. Many countries reduce product prices during festivals, but we fail to do so....’ Addressing journalists, he said, ‘Your writings and reports can play a crucial role in raising awareness about quality standards. We encourage you to inform the public about BSTI’s activities.’ Obaidur further stated, ‘The government’s role is not to run businesses but to ensure proper policy and supervision. We want entrepreneurs to take the lead in improving quality so that Bangladesh becomes globally competitive.’ CAB president AHM Shafiquzzaman said that according to the Allocation of Business, it is BSTI’s mandate to issue Halal certifications, and it already has an internationally accredited Halal Laboratory. ‘If we can properly promote halal certification, Bangladesh’s halal exports could reach billion of dollars by 2030,’ he added. He also urged BSTI to take stricter measures against counterfeit and adulterated products. PRAN-RFL Group chairman Ahsan Khan Chowdhury noted that BSTI has undergone remarkable improvements in recent years and has become a symbol of quality practice in Bangladesh. He said, ‘We, the business community, wish to take advantage of BSTI’s modern laboratory facilities.’ He also requested BSTI to focus on Halal Laboratory accreditation, formulation of new standards, simplification of standardization procedures, and harmonization with international standards. BSTI director general SM Ferdous Alam emphasised adherence to international standards to ensure consumer protection and competitiveness, saying, ‘Countries strictly test and analyze products before accepting them for import. Therefore, we must align our supply chain with global quality benchmarks.’ He warned that counterfeit and substandard products, especially in cosmetics and food, pose serious health hazards. ‘In recent drives, some cosmetics were found to contain hydroquinone levels thousands of times higher than permitted, posing long-term risks to kidneys, liver, and overall health, particularly for adolescent girls and pregnant women,’ he said, urging coordinated action from law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Highlighting BSTI’s recent development activities, Ferdous said that the BSTI has introduced QR-coded online licenses to prevent forgery and illegal use of standard marks, established the National Halal Laboratory, Helmet Testing Laboratory, Solar Panel Testing Laboratory, and Cement Testing Laboratory, and installed advanced equipment for gold purity certification. He added that BSTI has also launched 10 new regional offices to strengthen institutional capacity and is expanding its testing parameters to include more products in line with international standards.

{"title": "‘In Search of Peace’ explores harmony of surroundings", "body": "Visual artist Sadrul Rafi explores the theme of harmony in his fourth solo art exhibition, currently under way at Galerie Zoom, Alliance Française de Dhaka, Dhanmondi. The two-week exhibition features 25 of Rafi’s drawings and paintings, inspired by both classical and contemporary artistic traditions. The exhibition was inaugurated on October 17 by renowned visual artist Professor Shahjahan Ahmed Bikash. Rafi’s artworks are characterised by strong, bold lines and intricate textures, with his canvases incorporating a diverse range of motifs, including themes of belief, science, technology, and cosmology. His work bears clear influences from iconic European masters such as Pablo Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Sandro Botticelli, Claude Monet and Henry Moore. At the same time, Rafi draws inspiration from celebrated Bangladeshi artists like S M Sultan, Zainul Abedin, Shafiuddin Ahmed and Shahabuddin Ahmed. Among the works displayed is an ink-on-paper drawing titled Buffalo in a Peaceful Environment-1, which features a serene landscape at sunrise, complete with hills, rivers, forests, and clouds, while a buffalo nearly fills the canvas. Another notable piece is an acrylic-on-canvas paper painting titled The Inspiration of Peace Everywhere, which symbolises healing from trauma and destruction by depicting the process of replacing scratches with flowers.

{"title": "Barcelona defence on ‘another level’ now: Flick", "body": "Barcelona coach Hansi Flick claimed Monday his team’s defending is now on ‘another level’ after a run of good results. The Catalans have won three matches in a row after a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea in the Champions League near the end of November. Barca face Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday in Europe as they fight for a top eight finish in the league phase. With several players back from injury last week Barca beat Atletico Madrid 3-1 and Real Betis 5-3. ‘Everyone knows what happened in the last three months, a lot of injuries, very important players out, the last weeks we have to manage the minutes, the load of every player,’ Flick told a news conference. The coach said although his team shipped three against Betis, the use of his high defensive line system was good and the players were tired in the final stages, when two of those goals were scored. ‘The last 10 minutes, they were exhausted,’ reasoned Flick, whose side also let in three at Club Brugge in a 3-3 draw earlier in November. ‘I said this morning to them, the (back) line is doing really good, we’re getting pressure on the ball, we are connected. This is what we need. ‘And the (high) line, they play it on another level than maybe one month, five weeks ago.’ The win over Betis left Barca four points clear at the top of La Liga, with attention turning to the clash against Frankfurt. In 2022 Barcelona suffered a humiliating Europa League elimination at the hands of the German side, whose fans filled the stands at Camp Nou. Barcelona restricted access to tickets as a result this year, anxious to avoid similar scenes at their reopened stadium. That defeat was arguably the club’s lowest ebb, but in the years since they have risen sharply, reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League last season. The Frankfurt match will be the club’s first game in the competition at Camp Nou since October 2022. ‘For everyone it was a dream to come back and play in Camp Nou,’ said Flick. ‘It’s also important for the Champions League. It’s a really important match for us tomorrow. ‘We have to win, we want to win three points. We want to show our best level.’ The coach said goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen may return to the squad after injury but made clear Joan Garcia ‘is number one’.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/284610/barcelona-defence-on-another-level-now-flick", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 402},
{"title": "Poor hiring points to US economic weakness", "body": "US private-sector hiring data released Wednesday painted a downcast picture of the job market in the world’s biggest economy, especially among small businesses. The report showed US companies shed 32,000 jobs in November, payroll firm ADP said, in a surprise drop set to firm up expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. President Donald Trump has been touting the economy’s health, and forecasts had incorrectly predicted the monthly data would show a net rise in employment. ‘Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,’ ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said. ‘While November’s slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.’ The ADP data had been expected to show 20,000 new jobs created, according to a consensus of analysts reviewed by Briefing.com. ‘This is no longer a low hiring job market, it’s a start-to-fire job market,’ said Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union. ‘The only industries still hiring are hospitality and healthcare. If you don’t want to work at a bar or in health care, you’re out of luck.’ While medium and large establishments added jobs last month, small establishments lost 1,20,000 jobs, according to ADP. Long described small firms as the most impacted by Trump’s barrage of tariff announcements, adding that the ADP report points to the potential for more weakness ahead. ‘The start-to-fire labour market is likely to remain in place for the first half of 2026 until there’s more certainty on tariffs and more confidence among businesses to begin hiring again,’ Long said. The figures are considered unreliable by some analysts, but are still closely watched as a gauge of the US economy especially as official data is incomplete due to a federal government shutdown that has now ended. When the Fed meets next week, it will be forced to do without influential inputs for evaluating monetary policy. The Labour Department won’t publish employment data for October and has pushed the November reading back until December 16 — after the Fed’s December 10 meeting decision date. The US central bank is also contending with a dearth of consumer pricing data. Fed officials have signalled greater concern about the state of the job market, lifting expectations that the central bank will cut interest rates next week for the third straight time. ‘The (ADP) report shows the job market is losing more momentum at year-end and skews risks toward modestly higher unemployment early next year,’ said Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin. ‘There’s a high level of disagreement among Fed policymakers right now, but we maintain our call the doves will prevail over the hawks ... to vote for another 25 basis point interest rate reduction at next week’s meeting.’ Other US data released Wednesday contained conflicting signs on the economy. Industrial production increased 0.1 per cent in September, in line with analyst expectations. The US services sector reported growth in November, with the Institute of Supply Management’s overall rating coming in at 52.6, a 0.2 percentage point gain from the prior month and slightly more than analyst expectations. But the employment index came in at 48.9, below the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. Multiple officials surveyed pointed to the lingering cloud surrounding trade policy, ISM said in a press release. A real estate official said tariff uncertainty adds ‘complexity to purchasing, and economic conditions remain mixed, with some indicators pointing to good prospects and others to worrying ones.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/284180/poor-hiring-points-to-us-economic-weakness", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 580},
{"title": "G20 grapples with splintering world order", "body": "G20 leaders gathered Sunday in South Africa hailed multilateralism — even as they struggled to adapt to a changing world order beset by go-it-alone US policies, wars and deepening geopolitical rivalries. The final day of their weekend summit — boycotted by the United States — kicked off with a searching discussion on how the G20 can survive in a fragmenting world. ‘We are not experiencing a transition, but a rupture,’ acknowledged Canadian prime minister Mark Carney to journalists just before the summit session. ‘Too many countries are retreating into geopolitical blocs or the battlegrounds of protectionism,’ he said, but added: ‘In every rupture resides the responsibility to build—nostalgia is not a strategy.’ Dozens of leaders from key economies around the world — including Europe, China, India, Japan, Turkey, Brazil and Australia — attended the summit, the first to be held in Africa. US president Donald Trump’s government snubbed the event, saying South Africa’s priorities — including cooperation on trade and climate — ran counter to its policies. The United States is retreating from multilateral forums as it stokes trade volatility with sweeping tariffs and reverses commitments to fight global warming. Trump’s officials have also made unfounded accusations of a ‘white genocide’ in South Africa. In a joint G20 statement issued Saturday, the leaders present said they were meeting ‘against the backdrop of rising geopolitical and geo-economic competition and instability, heightened conflicts and wars, deepening inequality, increasing global economic uncertainty and fragmentation’. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa admitted ‘challenges’, but said: ‘The G20 underscores the value of the relevance of multilateralism.’ The leaders’ declaration was issued despite Washington objecting to the summit making any statement in the name of the G20. The UK-based Oxfam charity said ‘South Africa has set an example to the world in ensuring the G20 stood firm and collectively agreed on a leader’s declaration — defending multilateralism — despite powerful opposition’. Nevertheless, French president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said that ‘the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle’. It needs to refocus its priorities on strategic economic issues going forward, he said, noting ‘difficulties’ in the G20 finding common approaches to armed conflicts around the world. That somewhat reflected a US intention to limit G20 discussions to just macroeconomic topics as it takes on hosting duties next year — when Trump plans to hold the summit at a Florida golf club he owns. The G20 — comprising 19 nations plus the European Union and the African Union — was founded in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis as a forum to boost global economic and financial stability. Over time, its discussions have broadened to also cover climate change, sustainable development, global health and conflicts. While those areas have economic implications, they are also political — often resulting in impasses or omissions in drafting summit declarations. Divisions have only widened over Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Carney — whose country this year holds the G7 presidency, to be taken up by France next year — also said that ‘the centre of gravity in the global economy is shifting’, implying that the G20 needed to take greater note of emerging economies and the global South. William Gumede, a management professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa who advises governments, including Turkey’s, noted that several countries not part of the G20 were invited to the summit, including African ones. ‘Bringing emerging powers and developing countries was like creating a whole new world into the G20 and that actually helped to neutralise the Trump absence,’ he said. ‘This summit has actually thrown a lifeline to multilateralism, breathing new life into it,’ he said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/283087/g20-grapples-with-splintering-world-order", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 615},

In a statement issued on Sunday, the organisation said that the attack reflected the continuing fragility of political and civic safety, despite months of reforms following the July uprising. The organisation warned that such violence undermines the promise of a reformed ‘Bangladesh 2.0’ and raises serious concerns about the safety of young leaders, first-time voters and citizens engaged in democratic participation, particularly ahead of the 13th national elections scheduled for February 2026. The organisation urged the interim government to ensure safe and inclusive civic spaces at all times, not only during election periods. Highlighting Hadi’s role in the organisation, ERP said he has been a prominent voice since its launch in September 2024, advocating civility, principled engagement and education-led social reform. The statement also linked the attack to the unresolved legacy of authoritarian rule, saying the pledge of ‘Never Again’ remains unfulfilled while political violence persists.

Carlo Ancelotti's team, featuring a mouthwatering attacking combination of Estevao, Matheus Cunha, Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr, dominated the first half of the friendly in London. Manchester United's Cunha headed against the bar as Brazil took a firm grip on the game but Chelsea's Estevao gave the South Americans the lead they deserved in the 28th minute. The 18-year-old was fortunate that the ball fell to his feet on the right side of Brazil's attack but he produced an unerring finish across Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy into the far corner. It was his fourth goal in his 10th game for Brazil and another reminder that he could be one to watch at next year's World Cup in North America. Captain Casemiro, 33, doubled Brazil's lead in the 35th minute, beautifully controlling a free-kick from Rodrygo and curling the ball into the top corner after finding space at the back post. Iliman Ndiaye should have pulled one back for the West African team shortly after the break after sloppy play from Brazil goalkeeper Ederson but hit the outside of the post. Two-time African player of the year Sadio Mane was unable to provide the spark his team needed and was withdrawn in the 75th minute, one of a number of changes for both teams. Five-time world champions Brazil reached next year's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States after a lacklustre campaign in which they finished fifth in South American qualifying.

{"title": "258 factories shut in a year, 1,00,000 lose jobs: AFWA", "body": "At least 258 factories shut down over the past year, leaving more than 100,000 workers unemployed and heightening social and economic risks, according to a report by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. Amrin Hossain Annie, gender officer of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, presented the findings at a dialogue titled ‘Actions needed amid technological transition, climate change and existing labour conditions’ held at the National Press Club on Sunday. Presided over by labour leader Abul Hossain, the function was addressed, among others, by economist Professor MM Akash, joint convenor of Sramik Karamchari Oikya Parishad Abdul Quader Howlader, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad Fouzia Moslem and Bangladesh representative of AFWA Arifur Rahman. Speakers said the combined impact of technological transformation, climate change and fragile labour conditions had pushed the garment sector into a more complex and uncertain reality. They stressed the need for a coordinated roadmap integrating technology, climate resilience and labour rights to overcome the ongoing crisis. Amrin said there was a clear disparity between the total profits generated by the garment industry and the wages received by workers. Despite Bangladesh’s critical position in the global supply chain, workers’ wages have yet to reach a living standard, she noted. Production costs and international competition are often shifted onto workers, limiting improvements in their quality of life. Currently, nearly four million workers are employed in the garment sector, more than 60 per cent of them women. While women’s participation in the workforce is a major achievement for economic development, their access to safe employment, gender-sensitive workplaces and decision-making processes remain limited. Political instability, declining buyer confidence, export market competition, power and energy shortages, and the global economic slowdown have further deepened uncertainty in the sector, she added. Professor Akash said resolving the crisis required coordinated action, including the declaration and enforcement of a humane, living national minimum wage. No worker’s wage should fall below the poverty line, he said, calling for rationing systems, training centres and the right to form trade unions across all sectors. He urged labour organisations to unite on a common platform to strengthen workers’ solidarity. Labour leader Abul Hossain said resolving the industry’s problems required the participation of all stakeholders, including workers, owners and the government. He emphasised the need to address low wages and wage discrimination and to ensure healthy and safe working conditions in factories.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/285245/258-factories-shut-in-a-year-100000-lose-jobs-afwa", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 389},
{"title": "Parties play blame game over admin control", "body": "Three major political parties — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, and the National Citizen Party — have raised allegations against the interim government, questioning its neutrality ahead of the upcoming national election. The political parties are raising questions about the government’s neutrality and blaming one another over control of the civil administration, appointing people loyal to their respective parties. The allegations are being raised at a time when the government begins processes for fresh appointments against the vacant posts of different government agencies and educational institutions and giving promotions at different levels in the bureaucracy. Law adviser Asif Nazrul on Wednesday said that all the political parties were raising allegations against the interim administration of being biased towards one group or another. Responding to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s demand to the chief adviser, Professor Muhammad Yunus, for playing the role of a non-party caretaker government, the law adviser claimed that the interim government was already functioning neutrally without being biased to any quarter. ‘All political parties make similar allegations against us—one says we are biased toward a particular group, while another says the opposite. Since one accuses us of favouring the other, it indicates that we are performing our responsibilities neutrally,’ the law adviser told reporters at the secretariat. BNP leaders have accused some advisers of political bias, claiming that administrative reshuffles and appointments are being made in favour of a particular group. The BNP, at its standing committee meeting on September 13, expressed concern over recent transfers and promotions, alleging that individuals close to a specific party were preferred while the party’s recommendations were ignored. The meeting also decided to formally convey the party’s concerns to the chief adviser. A four-member BNP delegation, led by secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, met Yunus on Tuesday at his state guest house Jamuna residence. During the meeting, BNP urged the interim government to operate in a ‘fully-fledged caretaker government mode’, ensuring neutrality in all administrative activities ahead of the Jatiya Sangsad elections, expected to be held early February next year. ‘We demanded removal of any partisan individuals remaining in the administration to maintain full impartiality,’ Fakhrul told reporters after the meeting, adding that they sought a complete restructuring of the central and field administrations to eliminate loyalists of the ousted regime. The BNP delegation also raised concerns over police recruitments and promotions and demanded neutral appointments in the judiciary. In response, Yunus assured the delegation that all transfers and appointments would be made under his direct supervision and based on merit. The BNP recently also objected to the formation of a cabinet committee on administrative appointments, claiming it violated existing rules. The committee includes advisers Salehuddin Ahmed, Mohammad Fawzul Kabir Khan, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, and Mahfuz Alam, alongside senior bureaucrats. Party insiders alleged that two advisers were showing ‘visible bias’, though no names were publicly mentioned. Meanwhile, Jamaat raised concerns over the imbalance in key institutions, alleging that 65-80 per cent of officers in the Election Commission, police, and prosecution are loyal to one political party. During a meeting led by Jamaat’s nayeb-e-amir Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher, with chief adviser on Wednesday, the party urged the chief adviser to ensure a level playing field by reassigning officers, who agreed to implement a lottery system while cautioning against manipulation. Jamaat, during the meeting, also warned that certain advisers were involved in misleading the chief adviser for political ends. Taher said that they had not demanded the removal of any adviser but emphasised that they expected timely action, warning that further measures would be considered if the issues were not addressed. Earlier, Jamaat accused certain advisers of ‘conspiracy’, with nayeb-e-ameer Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher claiming to possess evidence, including recorded voices from meetings. Jamaat secretary general Mia Golam Porwar alleged that some advisers were involved in ‘misleading’ Professor Muhammad Yunus while maintaining secret links with a political faction. The National Citizen Party, formed by the leaders of the July 2024 mass uprising, has also turned critical, accusing some advisers of pursuing ‘safe exits’ and political gain. NCP convener, Nahid Islam, said in a TV interview that ‘many advisers have built liaisons with political parties’. During a meeting with chief adviser on Wednesday, Nahid Islam also expressed concern over the neutrality and transparency of the Election Commission, alleging that it had shown favouritism towards certain parties while discriminating against others. He said that the EC was failing to function as a constitutional institution and warned that if the forthcoming election was not conducted fairly, the government would have to take full responsibility. Nahid also raised the issue of the party’s registration and its electoral symbol, the water lily, saying that the party would not participate in the election without its symbol. He called for a clear legal and constitutional explanation for the EC’s refusal to grant its electoral symbol, the water lily. The NCP convener also raised concerns about the composition and functioning of the advisory council, noting that it had been formed with members selected based on references from various political parties. He said that ensuring the council’s neutrality and competence was essential for conducting fair elections. Nahid alleged that certain advisors were assisting major political parties in the distribution of administrative posts and were involved in political affiliations, corruption, and incompetence. He said that these issues went beyond student advisors, noting that many other members had former political backgrounds. Nahid expressed serious concerns over public administration transfers and appointments, alleging that major political parties, with help from some advisory council members, were distributing key posts such as superintendents of police and deputy commissioners ahead of the elections. He also called for reform of the advisory council, urging the chief adviser to remove any advisers accused of incompetence, corruption, or political bias. Nahid stressed that both student and non-student advisers should be assessed equally, as all represent the mass uprising rather than any particular political group. Political analysts, however, said that the growing mistrust among the BNP, the NCP and Jamaat, all of whom initially backed the interim government, highlights mounting tension as the election nears. After the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, 2024 amid a student-led uprising, individuals close to the three parties were reportedly appointed to key administrative posts. The BNP and Jamaat have recently faced off over such appointments, as each allegedly blaming the other for control of the administration, said an official of the education ministry. Administrative reshuffles have slowed amid allegations of political lobbying and outside pressure. Recently, the cabinet secretary post remained vacant for 21 days due to competing demands for loyal appointees. A plan to withdraw 21 deputy commissioners promoted in March as joint secretaries is yet to be implemented. A senior official at the public administration ministry said that political lobbying was the main reason for delays in appointing new DCs and field-level officers. On the other hand, amid the outside pressure, the education ministry took an unprecedented step by inviting open applications for the post of Director General of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education. Since the fall of the Awami League regime, DSHE has seen three DGs, with Professor Azad Khan being the third to hold the position. Analysts said that all major political parties were now questioning the interim administration’s neutrality due to their political purposes.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/279901/parties-play-blame-game-over-admin-control", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 1221},

The shopping spree was once an annual opportunity for Alibaba and major rival JD.com to announce new purchase records, but they have withheld detailed sales totals in recent years. ‘The discounts aren’t as attractive now,’ said 29-year-old Shanghai resident Zhang Jing, who told AFP she bought ‘nothing’ during this year’s sales. Zhang said she was discouraged by online platforms’ increasingly complex promotions, which often require shoppers to claim multiple coupons or combine purchases in a specific order before they can enjoy a discount. ‘I’ve never participated in these complicated rules, not once,’ she said. Shi Xuebin, the 42-year-old owner of a clothing boutique, said she bought a new iPhone 17, but only because ‘I wanted to buy a new phone in the first place’. She told AFP she had bought far fewer Singles Day products compared to last year and that she had noticed a belt-tightening trend among Chinese consumers. ‘I feel the general economy hasn’t been great this year and people are avoiding buying things that aren’t absolutely necessary,’ Shi said. ‘Before, if you liked something, you’d buy it without much thought... but now, there’s a real sense of downgrading consumption.’ China’s leaders have fought to overcome sluggish domestic spending, a protracted crisis in the property sector and a trade war with the United States. The Communist Party’s top brass vowed to ‘vigorously boost consumption’ after a key planning meeting in Beijing last month. Consumer prices have been stagnant or in decline in recent months, although they rose in October after a weeklong national holiday boosted demand for travel and food. Zhu, a 30-year-old Shanghai resident who declined to give his full name, said his mother had taken advantage of November sales to stock up on household products such as laundry detergent and toilet paper. However, outside daily necessities, Zhu said he mostly shopped second-hand instead of buying new versions of the tools and books he needed for his calligraphy hobby. ‘We’re pretty practical—if I need something I will buy it but if I don’t need it, I just won’t get it no matter how cheap it is,’ he told AFP.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/281887/chinas-singles-day-shopping-fest-loses-its-shine", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 410},
{"title": "Dhaka must stop exploitation of migrants in Russia’s war", "body": "THE recent revelations that Bangladeshi migrant workers, who travelled to Russia through entirely legal means, are being coerced into fighting in the Russia–Ukraine war are shocking and deeply alarming. According to a BRAC report, a number of Bangladeshi migrants have been forced to join the war, with at least three reportedly killed and many others remaining missing. The report rightly observes that these are not isolated or accidental incidents; they form part of a disturbing pattern of trafficking, deception and forced recruitment that violates every fundamental principle of human rights. The victims were not illegal entrants; they were ordinary workers, holding valid visas and job offers in construction and logistics. The BRAC Migration Programme, which produced the report, mentions that at least 10 Bangladeshi families have informed it of losing contact with their migrant relatives soon after the latter entered Russia since late 2024. One such victim, who travelled on a valid Russian visa for a construction job, mentioned in his last message home that he was being moved towards the Ukrainian border, while another was photographed wearing combat gear and holding a rifle. Both families say that they have not heard from their relatives for months. The BRAC report further claims that it has found that victims were recruited through Bangladeshi brokers and international agents who arranged valid work permits for industrial sites, construction projects or warehouse jobs in Russia. Upon entering the country, many Bangladeshi migrants were stripped of their passports, threatened, and coerced into ‘volunteer’ service for the Russian military. The absence of a bilateral labour agreement with Russia has, as migration experts note, left Bangladeshi workers dangerously exposed. What is unacceptable, however, is the government’s woefully inadequate response. It is not enough for officials to shrug off responsibility by claiming, as an expatriates’ welfare and overseas employment ministry official has done, that the migrants travelled ‘through agencies or on their own’. When Bangladeshi citizens are trafficked abroad and coerced into combat, the state bears a duty — both moral and legal — to intervene. The expatriates’ welfare and overseas employment ministry, the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training, and law enforcement authorities should, therefore, coordinate a thorough investigation to trace the recruitment networks that originate at home and extend across borders. The Criminal Investigation Department’s acknowledgement that a ‘strong ring’ operates through a third country confirms that this is not a localised crime but a transnational racket exploiting the desperation of workers. The government must, therefore, act decisively and transparently — tracing the missing, prosecuting traffickers and ensuring that no Bangladeshi worker is ever again forced to fight another country’s war. Furthermore, no new migration to Russia should be permitted until credible guarantees are secured for worker safety and legal protection. Dhaka must also engage Moscow immediately to demand the repatriation of all coerced Bangladeshis and to ensure full accountability for those responsible.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/281756/dhaka-must-stop-exploitation-of-migrants-in-russias-war", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 477},
{"title": "ICT to set verdict date about Hasina today", "body": "The International Crimes Tribunal-1 is scheduled today to set a date for delivering its verdict in the crimes against humanity case against absconding deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, and detained former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun. They were tried for their alleged superior command responsibility in the atrocities committed across the country during the July uprising last year. This will be the first verdict in a case of crimes against humanity involving the July uprising that ousted the Hasina-led Awami League regime on August 5, 2024. The verdict date comes amid heightened tension, with crude bombs exploding, public transports set on fire, and flash processions erupting in the capital and elsewhere in the country since the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, announced a ‘Dhaka Lockdown’ for today on social media ahead of the tribunal’s decision. Security has been tightened around the tribunal compound, the Supreme Court, the Attorney General’s Office, and the Supreme Court Bar Association premises. Inspector general of police Baharul Alam and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner SM Sazzat Ali visited the ICT compound on Tuesday and Monday to oversee the security measures. The Supreme Court administration sent a letter to the Army headquarters requesting army deployment on the court compound, the SC public relations officer, Shafiqul Islam, said. The three-member tribunal, chaired by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, concluded the trial on October 23 after hearing closing arguments from attorney general Md Asaduzzaman and chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam. The bench on that day announced that it would fix a date for the verdict on November 13 and would not delay its pronouncement. Both the attorney general and the chief prosecutor sought death sentences for Hasina and Asaduzzaman, arguing that exemplary punishment was needed to prevent future governments from committing similar crimes using state power. Both remain hiding in India. The prosecution did not seek punishment for former IGP Mamun, who testified as state evidence, leaving his fate to the tribunal. Hasina and Asaduzzaman were tried in absentia, while detained ex-IGP Mamun appeared in the dock. State-appointed defence counsel Amir Hossain sought acquittal for Hasina and Asaduzzaman, arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of ‘widespread and systematic attacks’ or superior command responsibility as required under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, and international law. On July 10, the tribunal took cognisance of five charges against the accused. The first charge accused the trio of inciting the July violence. Hasina allegedly provoked attacks on protesters by calling them ‘sons and grandchildren of Razakars’ on July 14, 2024. The second charge links to an order for lethal action as she allegedly instructed the DU vice-chancellor and law enforcement agencies to ‘hang or kill’ protesters and directed the use of live fire and drones against them. The third charge is linked to the killing of Abu Sayeed.

{"title": "Russian attack batters Ukraine energy grid", "body": "Russian drones and missiles pummelled Ukraine’s struggling energy infrastructure early Friday, cutting power to thousands across the country and killing a seven-year-old boy, authorities said. The Russian attack, which combined hundreds of drones and nearly three dozen missiles, disrupted power supplies in nine regions and plunged entire districts of Kyiv into darkness. AFP journalists in the capital heard several loud explosions overnight and experienced blackouts and water supply disruptions in different parts of the city. Workers restored power to around 2,70,000 households in Kyiv by the afternoon, but parts of the east and south of the country remained cut off, according to Ukraine’s energy minister. ‘Around 3:00am, we heard a terrible rumbling. All the windows in the apartment were completely shattered,’ Kyiv resident Yevgeniya Charchiyan said after the strikes. ‘Thank God there was no fire, everyone is alive and well, but the apartment is currently uninhabitable,’ she added. Another resident, Viktoria, said that she was expecting a ‘difficult’ winter and had stocked up on power banks. ‘It’s impossible to get used to this,’ she said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky called Russia’s latest strikes a ‘cynical and calculated attack’, and urged allies to respond with concrete measures. Diplomatic efforts to end the three-and-a-half-year war have stalled in recent months. At least 214 civilians were killed across the country in September, UN rights monitors said in a report published Friday. The Kremlin has escalated aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems over recent weeks, building on earlier bombing campaigns over the previous three winters that left millions without heating in frigid temperatures. Russia said its forces had hit energy sites supplying power to Ukraine’s defence industry. The Ukrainian air force said the Russian barrage comprised 465 drones and 32 missiles, adding that 405 drones and 15 missiles were downed. A source in Ukraine’s energy sector said that the intensity of attacks was higher compared to last year, and that cloudy weather overnight had allowed drones to evade Ukrainian air defence systems. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said Russian forces had targeted ‘critical infrastructure’. Ukrainian police said some 33 people had been wounded in Kyiv and other regions. Russia also hit the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, killing a seven-year-old boy, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of the regional military administration. The attacks caused outages to a ‘significant number of customers’ mainly in the centre and the east of the country, the energy ministry said. ‘This was one of the largest concentrated strikes against energy facilities,’ Ukraine’s prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. It was the fourth attack in a week against the facilities of Ukraine’s biggest private electricity provider, DTEK, its CEO Maxim Timchenko said. Russian military blogger Alexander Kots said that two power plants in Kyiv, along with six others in different regions, were hit. Russian attacks this year have already strained Ukrainian gas infrastructure, Kyiv has said, and more strikes could force the country to ramp up imports. A Ukrainian delegation led by Svyrydenko is expected to visit the United States early next week to discuss, among other topics, energy and air defence under intensifying Russian strikes. The foreign ministry meanwhile said the overnight attack fell on the third anniversary of Russia’s first large-scale attack on energy facilities, months after Moscow invaded in February 2022. Efforts spearheaded by US president Donald Trump to end the three-and-a-half year war have faltered as a series of direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations this year ended. Trump said Thursday that Washington and NATO allies were ‘stepping up the pressure’ to end the war in Ukraine. But the Kremlin said that momentum towards reaching a peace deal had largely vanished.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/278692/russian-attack-batters-ukraine-energy-grid", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 607},
{"title": "Bank deposits grow by 10pc", "body": "Bank deposits in Bangladesh surged by 9.98 percent year-on-year at the end of September 2025, achieving the second-highest growth rate recorded over the past 18 months. This strong performance signals a steady return of public confidence in the banking sector following months of stagnation. The impressive September figure follows an even higher 10.02 per cent increase in August, which was the highest growth rate seen in 17 months. Before this positive trend started in August, deposit growth had remained under the 9 per cent threshold for 13 consecutive months, with the last time it surpassed 9 per cent being in June 2024, when it reached 9.25 per cent. According to Bangladesh Bank data, total deposits in the banking sector reached Tk 19.14 lakh crore at the end of September 2025, compared to Tk 17.41 lakh crore recorded in September 2024. Experts have described the September figures as ‘encouraging,’ noting that the overall performance reflects a significant recovery compared to the previous 16 months. They attributed the increase to three main factors – a shift of deposits towards strong banks, relatively higher interest rates compared to inflation, and a fall in treasury bill and bond yields. Top-tier banks have seen the most growth as depositors increasingly trust well-governed institutions. Following the change of government last year, many customers withdrew funds from weaker banks and moved them to stronger ones. Currently, most banks offer deposit rates between 8.5 per cent and 9.5 per cent, which remain higher than the 8.36 per cent inflation recorded in September. The report noted that during September, deposit interest rates were 25 to 50 basis points above average, encouraging people to park funds in banks as a safe investment option. At the same time, yields on treasury bills and bonds began to decline in September, prompting many individuals and institutions to shift their investments from government securities to bank deposits. Deputy managing director of the Dutch-Bangla Bank Limited Mohammed Shahid Ullah said that deposits are rising in banks that have improved their quality and governance. Confidence in the banking sector has grown, which is why deposits are increasing, he added. DMD of the Premier Bank PLC Abdul Quaium Chowdhury also said that year-end campaigns by banks, aimed at meeting annual targets, played a role in boosting deposits. According to Bangladesh Bank data, total deposits in the banking sector stood at Tk 19.14 lakh crore at the end of September 2025, compared to Tk 17.41 lakh crore in the same month last year. Customer confidence is gradually returning to Islami Bank Bangladesh Ltd, IFIC Bank and United Commercial Bank, which have all reported strong growth in deposits in recent months. After the change in government, Bangladesh Bank dissolved the boards of several banks, including IBBL, IFIC, and UCB. Fearing instability, many depositors withdrew their funds, putting pressure on liquidity. Despite concerns about governance, these banks did not face difficulties in repaying depositors. After a year of weak growth, deposits are once again on the rise. IBBL, the country’s largest private bank, recorded a 14.7 per cent growth in deposits over the past year, driven by renewed public trust. As of September 2025, deposits at IBBL stood at Tk 1,79,579 crore, up from Tk 1,56,564 crore in September 2024. The bank came under pressure after 5 August 2024, when Chattogram-based businessman S Alam lost control of its board, sparking panic among depositors who rushed to withdraw funds. IFIC Bank also faced unrest and internal protests following the political transition, when its then-chairman Salman F Rahman, was removed. Rumours that the bank might collapse prompted a wave of withdrawals. However, over the past year, IFIC’s deposits have grown by Tk 5,714 crore, a 12.6 per cent rise, reaching Tk 51,127 crore in September 2025, up from Tk 45,412 crore a year earlier. UCB also faced significant withdrawals in the wake of the government change, but the bank has since recovered, adding over Tk 11,000 crore in deposits within a year. Deposits rose from Tk 54,439 crore in September 2024 to Tk 65,524 crore in September 2025. The Bangladesh Bank data showed that currency held outside the banking system declined by Tk 8,829 crore year-on-year. As of September 2025, currency outside banks stood at Tk 2.74 lakh crore, compared to Tk 2.83 lakh crore in September 2024.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/282058/bank-deposits-grow-by-10pc", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 716},
{"title": "BB allows local insurers to cover open account exports", "body": "Bangladesh Bank has allowed exporters to use insurance coverage from local companies for shipments under open account credit terms. It simplifies export procedures and reduces dependence on foreign institutions. According to a circular issued by the central bank on Tuesday, authorised dealer banks can now arrange payment undertakings or payment risk coverage from Bangladeshi insurance companies for export transactions conducted under open account terms. Previously, such exports were permitted only when backed by designated foreign institutions. The new policy will enable exporters to secure coverage from local insurers through foreign currency-denominated insurance policies, ensuring that export claims are settled in foreign currency if payments are not received. To manage exposure, insurance companies are required to obtain reinsurance coverage from foreign sources in line with regulatory rules, the circular said. Under the guidelines, banks will pay insurance premiums from exporters’ Exporters’ Retention Quota (ERQ) accounts and may open foreign currency accounts for insurance companies to handle premium receipts, reinsurance payments, and claim settlements. Any unutilised balance in those accounts must be converted to local currency and transferred to the respective insurers’ taka accounts. The circular also allows banks to provide post-shipment or early payment financing to exporters against insurance-backed exports, including through their offshore banking units. BB officials said that the move would enhance flexibility and competitiveness for Bangladeshi exporters, especially small and medium-sized firms that often struggle to secure costly payment guarantees from foreign institutions. By involving local insurers, exporters can manage risks domestically while retaining faster access to financing through local banks. Export under open account terms means goods are shipped before payment is made, with the buyer agreeing to pay within a specified period. Such arrangements are common in global trade but carry payment risks. The inclusion of local insurance-backed coverage now provides exporters with an added layer of security, making the system more efficient and accessible. Economists and exporters have long urged the central bank to diversify trade finance instruments and reduce reliance on letters of credit (LCs), which involve lengthy documentation and higher costs. The latest decision is expected to broaden export financing options.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/278371/bb-allows-local-insurers-to-cover-open-account-exports", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 348},
{"title": "Mehidy rues lack of big partnerships", "body": "Bangladesh captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz rued the lack of big partnerships after losing to Afghanistan in the first of the three-match ODI series by five wickets at the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Opting to bat first, the Tigers were restricted to 221 in 48.5 overs. In reply, Afghanistan reached 226-5 with 17 balls to spare. For Afghanistan, Azmatullah Omarzai took 3-40 and then made 40 to give his team a 1-0 lead in the series. Bangladesh became 25-2 inside the sixth over when Omarzai had both Tanzid Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto. Saif Hasan, on his ODI debut, carried his T20I form into the 50-over format as he struck five boundaries in his 26 off 33-ball knock. But a string of four dots brought his downfall as he was caught by Rashid Khan off Nangeyalia Kharote. ‘We always lose [too] many wickets in the first 15 overs. It’s been difficult to bat on this wicket. The wicket was turning a little bit, and we were struggling in that period,’ Mehidy said after the match. However, Mehidy and Towhid Hridoy recovered well to lay a base for a strong finish with a partnership of 101 runs off 142 deliveries. However, a mix-up with his captain led to Towhid’s run-out, shaking Bangladesh’s confidence. Mehidy, though, praised Towhid for his effort. ‘The way Tawhid Hridoy played was really good. When the crunch moment came, the batters played calm and cool cricket, and sometimes with a positive intent,’ he said. But when Mehidy was dismissed after making 56 runs in the final spell of Rashid Khan, a familiar collapse followed. Jaker Ali and Nurul Hasan both embraced the same fate as Mehidy. Mehidy rued the lack of having big partnerships as Bangladesh lost their last six wickets for just 46 runs. ‘But in the end, we are not getting partnerships, and that’s the problem,’ said Mehidy. Afghanistan, on the other hand, lost wickets in clusters on multiple occasions. But they got the partnerships to regain control. While Bangladesh managed a hundred-run partnership, Afghanistan got three fifty-run partnerships. ‘I mentioned that if we could get 260 plus, it would definitely be better, because we are a good bowling side, and we are not giving away many runs,’ Mehidy said. The Bangladesh captain also hoped to bounce back in the second match, scheduled on October 11 at the same venue. He said, ‘We had a chance. Now we have an opportunity to get better because we know we made some mistakes in this match, and we need to learn from these matches as soon as possible.’ ‘I am confident that our boys will do well in the next match,’ he added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/278573/mehidy-rues-lack-of-big-partnerships", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 449},

They have understood that the people are now ready to show them red cards in the next election,’ he said, apparently meaning the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, at a rally in Sylhet. He said that the struggling people would resist all kinds of conspiracies of the party if they tried to foil the election. The BNP, after a meeting with the chief election commissioner at the Nirbachan Bhaba in Dhaka on Thursday, said that they wanted the forthcoming 13th parliamentary election to be held in due time. The Jamaat chief told the Sylhet rally that the fascists had gone from the country but the black shadow of fascism was yet to go. The rally was organised by the Jamaat-led eight-party alliance on Sylhet Government Alia Madrassah ground to press home their five-point demand, including holding the next general election in a proportional representation system. ‘One party has fled the country after committing misdeeds, while another party has taken the responsibility of those misdeeds on its shoulders. A group has become a cause of public anger by doing extortion and anarchic activities, while another group is doing the same with double zeal,’ Shafiqur said. ‘The trend of jailing, torturing, hanging, and deporting opposition political leaders and Islamic scholars has not stopped yet,’ he alleged. Islami Andolan Bangladesh amir Mufti Syed Muhammad Rezaul Karim told the rally that a level playing field for the elections would be created when the demands of the July uprising would be implemented and the kidnappers, murderers, and money launderers would be tried visibly. Presided over by Khelafat Majlish amir Abdul Basit Azad, the rally was addressed, among others, by Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish amir Mamunul Haque, Nejam-e-Islam Party senior nayeb-e-amir Abdul Mazid Atahari, Bangladesh Development Party president AKM Anwarul Haque and Jatiya Ganatantrik Party vice-president and spokesperson engineer Rashed Khan.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/284409/people-ready-to-show-red-card-to-a-party-for-misdeeds-jamaat-amir", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 354},

{"title": "Russian strikes kill 25 as Zelensky makes peace bid in Turkey", "body": "A Russian strike on the west Ukrainian city of Ternopil on Wednesday killed at least 25 people, including three children, ripping off the top floors of a block of flats and overshadowing president Volodymyr Zelensky’s push to revive a peace process in Turkey. A US official said however that US president Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff will not be attending talks in Turkey, casting further doubt as to what the Ukrainian leader could achieve there. The attack on Ternopil was the deadliest for weeks and the worst on the west of the country — far from the frontline — since Moscow invaded in 2022. AFP saw dozens of rescuers searching through rubble after the strike, using cranes to get to the destroyed building. Thick grey smoke engulfed the streets just after explosions were heard at 7.00am. Ternopil officials reported the fires had caused chlorine levels in the air to spike to six times the norm, and called on the city’s 2,00,000 residents to stay home and close their windows. Rescuers dangled on cabins hanging from cranes trying to reach the top of the stricken Soviet-ear apartment block. Wrapped in a pink blanket, 46-year-old Oksana waited for news of her 20-year-old son, Bohdan. ‘I went to work, and my son stayed at home. I called him from the minibus and said ‘Bohdan, get dressed and come out’,’ she said. ‘He said: ‘Mum, don’t worry, everything will be fine.’ But it was too late. That’s it,’ she said. Her sister, Natalia Bachinska, said the family lived on the ninth floor. ‘Their apartment is completely gone. He still has not been found.’ The interior ministry said 25 people, including three children, were killed ‘as a result of Russian shelling of the city’. It added that 75 people, including 15 children, were wounded. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it would bring the ‘horrific killing’ to the ‘forefront’ at a UN Security Council meeting in New York on Thursday and called for international condemnation. ‘This is how Russia’s ‘peace plans’ look like in reality,’ foreign minister Andriy Sybiga said. The strike came as Russia batters Ukraine’s energy grid ahead of the winter, and with Ukraine’s stretched troops under pressure on the frontline. In Moscow, the Kremlin declined to comment on a report by US media outlet Axios that it had been working on a secret plan with the United States to end the almost four-year-long war. Kyiv’s air force said Russia had fired more than 476 drones and 48 missiles overnight. The attacks also wounded at least 46 people in the northeastern region of Kharkiv, and targeted other areas of western Ukraine. Neighbouring Romania scrambled fighter jets as it reported a Russian drone had crossed into its airspace, while Moldova also said its airspace was breached during the night. Ahead of his talks in Turkey, Zelensky called on Ukraine’s Western backers to do more to get Russia to end the war. ‘Every brazen attack against ordinary life shows that the pressure on Russia is insufficient,’ he said. In Turkey, Zelensky was to meet with president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He said they would ‘discuss the best ways to ensure Ukraine achieves a just peace’. A day earlier, Zelensky said the trip to Ankara would ‘reinvigorate’ frozen peace talks. A senior Ukrainian official said the ‘main goal is for the Americans to re-engage’ in peace efforts. But Witkoff — who Kyiv said was initially scheduled to join — not attending dashed those hopes. Kyiv wants Washington to push Russia to the negotiating table, including by imposing sanctions, the Ukrainian official had said. Turkey — which retains working relations with Moscow and Kyiv — has hosted several rounds of talks between the warring sides. So far, these have only yielded prisoner exchanges and the repatriation of killed soldiers’ bodies. The Kremlin said no Russian official would be at the talks, but that it remained open to negotiations. Trump has sought to leverage his relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to end the war, but has so far failed to make progress. Russian troops are making slow but steady advances and Putin has demanded Kyiv cede more territory and renounce Western military support if it wants to halt the invasion.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/282659/russian-strikes-kill-25-as-zelensky-makes-peace-bid-in-turkey", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 700},

The conviction and sentencing affirm a fundamental principle: no one, regardless of power, is above the law,’ he said in a statement issued by his press wing tonight. This verdict offers vital, if insufficient, justice to the thousands harmed in the uprising of July and August 2024, and to the families who still carry their loss, the Chief Adviser said. ‘We stand at a moment of rebuilding democratic foundations wrecked by years of oppression. The crimes at issue-the ordering of lethal force against young people and children whose only weapons were their voices violated both our laws and the basic bond between government and citizens,’ he added. Professor Yunus said these acts outraged Bangladeshis’ core values: dignity, resilience, and commitment to justice. ‘As many as 1,400 lives were lost. They were not statistics but students, parents, and citizens with rights,’ he said, adding, months of testimony detailed how lethal force, even from helicopters, was used against unarmed protesters. ‘This verdict recognizes their suffering and confirms that our justice system will hold perpetrators accountable,’ the chief adviser said. Noting that Bangladesh is now rejoining global currents of accountability, he said ‘The students and citizens who stood for change understood this, and many paid with their lives-giving their today for our tomorrow’. The path ahead requires not just legal accountability but rebuilding trust between institutions and citizens, Prof Yunus said, adding, understanding why people risk everything for genuine representation-and creating systems worthy of that trust-is essential. ‘Today’s verdict is a step on that journey,’ he said. ‘I have every confidence that Bangladesh will meet the challenges ahead with courage and humility,’ the Chief Adviser added. With commitment to the rule of law, human rights, and each person’s potential, justice will not merely survive in Bangladesh, Prof Yunus said, adding, ‘It will prevail and sustain.’ Earlier, on Monday, the International Crimes Tribunal-1 sentenced Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death for the crimes against humanity committed during the July-August 2024 mass uprising.

Their observations came at the seminar titled ‘Toward sustainable cities: understanding and assessing Bangladesh’s trajectory towards SDG-11 by 2030,’ organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Planners at its conference hall at Banglamotor, marking World Town Planning Day 2025. They emphasised inclusive planning across urban, rural, haor, hill and char regions to make Bangladesh’s Sustainable Development Goals achievable. While presenting the keynote paper, the institute’s general secretary Shaikh Muhammad Mehedi Ahsan reminded the seminar that SDG-11 which centred the ‘making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable’ theme comprised 10 targets and 15 indicators covering areas, including sustainable housing and urbanisation, transport systems, cultural and natural heritage, and the reduction of human and economic losses from disasters. He said that Bangladesh’s trajectory towards SDG-11 remained slow and uneven due to inconsistent definitions and a lack of standardised indicators, obsolete datasets, technical capacity gaps among stakeholders, fragmented governance, weak urban financing, and limited collaboration with global and regional knowledge partners. To achieve the SDG goal, the urban planner suggested strengthening data governance and capacity, improving inter-ministerial coordination, empowering local governments, targeting vulnerable populations, promoting sustainable urban infrastructure and services, and adopting an integrated five-year strategic approach to budgeting and implementation. Addressing the event as chief guest, housing and public works ministry secretary Md Nazrul Islam said that although adequate laws and financial resources existed, the lack of good governance and accountability was hindering sustainable development in the country. ‘If those responsible for executing plans, especially political leaders, do not stand firm, it will be impossible to establish good governance, ensure the rule of law, and work in a systematic manner—even with good design and planning,’ he added. Member of the General Economics Division at the Bangladesh Planning Commission Monzur Hossain, also a government secretary, said that Bangladesh ranked 114th out of 167 countries globally in the 2025 SDG Index, and out of about 150 SDG targets, the country could not yet set targets for around 100. He added that with rapid urbanisation, the country’s public infrastructure, transport and other services were also expanding, and addressing these challenges required coordinated efforts and strong institutions.

Earlier, on October 31, election commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarkar, told reporters at the Patuakhali circuit house that the schedule for the upcoming JS elections would be announced in the first week of December. The CEC said that the mock voting was conducted transparently and in an open environment, reflecting the type of election the commission aimed to deliver. ‘We want to offer the nation an election as transparent as today’s mock vote,’ he said, expressing confidence that law and order would gradually improve and be favourable for the polling. Asked about the schedule announcement, the CEC said, ‘Hopefully, the schedule will be declared in the second week of December.’ He said that changes in the administration might be made if required after the schedule was published. Explaining the rationale behind the mock voting, the CEC that said the EC wanted to observe an ideal polling environment — from voter queues and the role of polling officials to the conduct of presiding officers and journalists. The exercise simulated the entire process: voters queuing, presenting voter slips, receiving ballots, entering the secret booth, and casting their votes. He said that many first-time voters had never witnessed an election in reality, especially those who had become voters in the last 15 years. The mock exercise, the CEC said, offered them practical experience and allowed the commission to conduct a real-time assessment of the polling centre management. With both the JS elections and a referendum planned to take place simultaneously, the CEC said that the commission must examine whether more than the existing 42,500 polling centres would be needed, and whether additional booths or staff must be deployed. Addressing questions about restrictions on journalists inside polling booths, the CEC said that the intention was not to hinder media activities but to prevent overcrowding. ‘In a single room, there are agents, polling officers, presiding officers and voters. If journalists and observers also gather inside, it could disrupt operations. We ask for responsible timing, not restrictions,’ he explained. On concerns that many elderly voters are unaware of the referendum, the CEC said that mass publicity had not begun yet. The government, information ministry, cultural ministry, Election Commission and media would soon launch extensive campaigns, he said. The CEC said that the referendum, authorised under a recent ordinance, would contain four bundled questions with only two response options — ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Responding to questions about the law and order, the CEC acknowledged that isolated crimes occurred everywhere but said that the overall situation was improving. The commission continued coordinating with the law enforcement agencies and the training personnel to ensure a peaceful polling environment, he said. The mock voting saw long queues, delays in locating voter numbers and slower-than-expected vote casting by some participants. The CEC admitted that the exercise revealed gaps, observing that this was precisely why real-time assessments were necessary. ‘If we need to increase the number of polling centres or booths, we will. Our aim is not to cause inconvenience to voters,’ he said. He reiterated that the commission was adequately prepared for and committed to delivering smooth and credible elections and referendum.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/elections/283622/js-polls-schedule-likely-in-dec-2nd-week-cec", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 584},

The former MP, Shakib Al Hasan has been asked to appear at the ACC headquarters at 10:00 am on November 26 to give his statement. The prime accused in the case is Md. Abul Khair (Hiru), a deputy registrar at the Department of Cooperatives. According to the ACC, Abul Khair violated Section -17 of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance-1969 and engaged in market manipulation for personal gain by conducting fraudulent 'series transactions,' deceptive 'active trading,' and 'gambling speculation' through his own interest-linked BO accounts. By artificially inflating share prices, he lured general investors into the market. The ACC alleged that this caused a total loss of Taka 256,97,70,304 to investors. The complaint further stated that Abul Khair transferred Tk 29,94, 42,185 allegedly gained through market manipulation to different channels with the help of his wife Kazi Sadia Hasan in an attempt to conceal the source of the funds.

Pace spearhead Cummins has not played since picking up a lower back injury in a Test match against the West Indies in July. Cummins admitted time was running out to get his body ready for the opening Ashes Test beginning in Perth on November 21. ‘I'd say probably less likely than likely, but still got a bit of time,’ Cummins told reporters, adding that he felt a ‘bit stiff’. Cummins said he was still two weeks away from bowling again in the nets and then it would take time to rebuild his fitness to a level where he could play a full part in a Test. ‘You want at least a month in the nets, getting used to it,’ said Cummins. ‘If you're going to play a Test match you want to make sure you're right to bowl 20 overs a day and you don't have to really think about it. ‘I know I'm running today and running every second day, and each run is a bit longer, and then we get into bowling prep next week. ‘Probably a couple of weeks to go before I'm putting on the spikes and bowling out on turf.’ Australia coach Andrew McDonald said last week he was still considering whether to include Cummins in the side, even if he was a ‘little bit underdone’ with his rehabilitation. Australia retained the Ashes in England in 2023 after the series ended in a 2-2 draw.

{"title": "Dolomite boosts crop yields for Rajshahi farmers: experts", "body": "Dolomite has emerged as a game-changer for many farmers in the Rajshahi region, especially in the Barind tract, significantly increasing crop yields and improving soil health over the past few years. Dolomite, a naturally occurring mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, is widely used as a soil amendment to neutralise acidity — a common issue in Barind’s soils. By improving soil pH, dolomite enhances nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus, and supports beneficial microbial activity, all of which are vital for healthy plant growth. Experts said that correcting soil acidity and promoting nutrient balance through dolomite application had led to marked improvements in agricultural productivity. As a result, farmers are seeing higher yields and greater financial returns. Helal Uddin, 48, a farmer from Soronjai village in Tanore upazila, harvested 97 mounds of potatoes per bigha on his traditional plot. But from an adjacent experimental plot treated with dolomite and other inputs, he harvested 116 mounds — a 20 per cent increase. During a recent farmers’ field day held at Soronji playground, similar success stories were shared. Mainul Islam, 43, from the same village, reported harvesting 115 mounds of potatoes per bigha in an experimental plot compared to just 90 mounds from his regular practice. His chickpea yield doubled — 13 mounds on the experimental plot versus six on his own field. Ariful Islam of Pachandar village said that he reaped nine mounds of lentils from the test plot, compared to six mounds from his traditional system. He described the combined dolomite and organic matter approach as cost-effective and sustainable. In Gomastapur upazila, Abdul Moin, 56, saw similar benefits. He cultivated wheat on two bighas — one traditional and one experimental. The plot treated with dolomite yielded 18 mounds, while the untreated one produced only 12. These results were part of a series of field trials conducted in Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, and Naogaon districts. The trials compared traditional farming practices with enhanced methods that used dolomite, organic fertilizers, and bio-pesticides. According to the Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI), dolomite helps create a soil environment that improves the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers while reducing environmental harm from fertilizer runoff. This leads to better nutrient uptake, healthier crops, and increased yields. The SRDI’s Rajshahi regional office has set up 164 demonstration plots under its project titled ‘Acidic Soil Management and Sustainable Crop Production through Climate-Smart Agriculture in Rajshahi and Rangpur Divisions, including the Madhupur Tract.’ The project also trained 970 sub-assistant agriculture officers and progressive farmers on soil management techniques. SRDI provides location-specific guidance on soil amendments and fertiliser use through its Upazila Nirdeshika, helping farmers apply dolomite and other treatments effectively and sustainably. Nurul Islam, principal scientific officer at SRDI, said that farmers participating in the project received comprehensive support including fertilisers, irrigation, labour and technical guidance to manage one bigha of experimental crop land. ‘Dolomite is a key tool for improving soil health in Rajshahi’s High Barind Tract,’ Nurul said, adding, ‘Our goal is to increase average crop yields by addressing soil acidity and promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), ensuring long-term agricultural resilience and productivity.’ He emphasised that improving soil quality and fertility through sustainable practices not only boosted yields but also ensured that resources were preserved for future generations.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/agriculture/278663/dolomite-boosts-crop-yields-for-rajshahi-farmers-experts", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 535},

England, who secured qualification for next year’s tournament with two matches to spare, host Serbia at Wembley next Thursday and face Albania away three days later. Real Madrid midfielder Bellingham was left out of Tuchel’s squad for games in October, when the 22-year-old had just returned from shoulder surgery. Manchester City forward Phil Foden, who scored two goals in his club’s 4-1 Champions League win against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, has not played for England since March. ‘I think the contribution of both of them to their clubs lately was immense,’ Tuchel told reporters on Friday. ‘They play regularly, of course, they play a big part and a big role in the success of Real and City’s matches lately. ‘They score regularly decisive goals, so we’re delighted that they’re in shape, in form and back with us.’ Tuchel said last month that Bellingham’s high-profile omission from his squad for the Group K fixtures against Wales and Latvia was due to his ‘lack of rhythm’ and was nothing personal. The German said in August he had apologised to the midfielder after ‘unintentionally’ describing his on-pitch behaviour as ‘repulsive’. ‘He is still young, if you look at his career it feels sometimes he’s 26, 28, but he’s still a very young player and he has our full support,’ the England boss said on Friday. ‘We want to provide a stable environment for him, that he can show the level of performance that helps us to be a better team.’ Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott is the most eye-catching new inclusion in the 25-man squad, with Nico O’Reilly and Jarell Quansah the other uncapped players involved. There are recalls for Adam Wharton and Nick Pope while Morgan Gibbs-White, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Myles Lewis-Skelly, James Trafford and Ollie Watkins have dropped out. Tuchel opted against recalling midfielder Jack Grealish, who is on loan at Everton from Manchester City, while Real Madrid right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold also misses out.

South Korea's Son, the former Tottenham captain who signed with LAFC in August for a reported MLS record $26 million, struck twice in the first half and again in the second. A former English Premier League golden boot winner, Son has had an instant impact in America after a decade at Tottenham, scoring five goals in six MLS matches. Denis Bouanga got the fourth to become the all-time leading scorer for LAFC, who moved into fourth place in the Western Conference two points above Seattle Sounders. Diego Luna came close to firing Real Salt Lake ahead in the second minute when he charged on to a cross in the penalty area, but his left-footed shot went wide. Just a minute later, Son punished the miss by putting the visitors in front. Timothy Tillman intercepted in midfield and threaded a short pass to Son, who raced alone toward the box and unleashed a shot past the advancing Salt Lake keeper Rafael. Son doubled the advantage 13 minutes later with a long-range blast that ripped between defenders and past a diving Rafael. LAFC's French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who had also been Son's teammate at Tottenham, produced a string of first-half saves to keep the Angelenos 2-0 up at the break. Real Salt Lake's Rwan Cruz missed a penalty in the 56th minute, his shot bouncing off the post and nearly tripping Lloris. Xavier Gozo finally got Real on the board with a goal in the 76th. Son responded with his third, slotting home a pass from Bouanga who got free after a counter-attack on the right. Bouanga sealed the match in the 88th minute after another fast break.

They were speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the two-day International Conference on Economics, Business and Technology Management, organised by School of Business and Entrepreneurship of Independent University, Bangladesh, at a hotel in the capital on Friday. In his speech as chief guest, Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre and chairman of BRAC, said that the exchange of knowledge was central to building a common, shared understanding. ‘The challenges being faced by Bangladesh are not unique. They are being faced across the world – across the global south and also the developed world,’ he added. There are commonalities and differences, and hopefully this conference will come to grips with many of these specific challenges that should be at the forefront of those present here, he added. IUB board of trustees chairman Didar A Husain said that Vietnam and China were introducing artificial intelligence at the school level. ‘They are ready for the 5th Industrial Revolution and we are only trying to graduate from the 3rd. So, there is a long way to go,’ he added. Professor M Tamim, vice-chancellor of IUB, said that they had 70 student papers in this conference, which was a great encouragement for them. ‘We have representatives from more than 12 countries who have come here with ideas and will share their research topics and industry experience,’ he added, saying that it was a great exposure for the students. At his speech as a guest of honour, Syed Nasim Manzur, managing director of Apex Footwear Limited said that, as Bangladesh transitioned from a manufacturing system based purely on arbitrage of labour to one grounded in sustainability and core values, industry-academia connections were critical to success. ‘Bangladesh is privileged to have some of the youngest people in our workforce, but creating the kind of quality jobs that are needed for these people is the challenge for modern industry in Bangladesh,’ he added.

The finance ministry confirmed the long-anticipated upgrade through a circular issued on October 14, signaling a new chapter in the region’s customs administration. With this declaration, Bhomra now assumes full authority over customs operations previously managed by the Khulna Customs House, ushering in greater autonomy, faster processing, and enhanced trade facilitation for the southwestern frontier. Officials concerned said that the decision would inject new dynamism into import and export activities in the country’s southwestern region and bring significant changes to the regional economy. Meanwhile, the Bhomra Customs Clearing and Forwarding Agents Association hailed the government’s move as ‘a historic milestone’. In a joint statement, president of the association Md Abu Hasan and general secretary Md Abu Musha said that the declaration of Bhomra land port as a Customs House by the finance ministry and the National Board of Revenue would greatly enhance business and trade opportunities in the region. ‘We wholeheartedly welcome this farsighted and timely decision of the government,’ they added. They further said that Bhomra was one of the busiest land ports in the country, handling a large volume of import and export trade every day. Upgradation to a Customs House will enhance administrative capacity, manpower, and infrastructure - long-awaited demands of the business community, they added. As a recognised Customs House, Bhomra will now be able to perform all revenue administration, tariff assessment, import-export document verification, and trade management activities locally.

The investments will bolster GSK’s research and development as well as production capacities in the US, the company said, as drugmakers faced pressure from Trump to invest more in the world’s biggest economy. Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs after his re-election last year, to force a range of industries to increase domestic production as he accused them of contributing to an ‘unfair’ US trade deficit. While the pharma industry has so far been spared swingeing tariffs, GSK and some of its rivals have personally been identified by Trump as needing to invest more in the US. ‘This week’s state visit brings together two countries that have led the world in science and healthcare innovation,’ GSK chief Emma Walmsley said in a statement Wednesday. Its US committment includes a $1.2-billion plan to build a biologics factory in Pennsylvania for developing respiratory and cancer treatments, and artificial intelligence development at its five US manufacturing sites. GSK said it already has around 15,000 employees in the United States, and its investments would create ‘hundreds of highly skilled jobs’. Its announcement is the first during Trump’s visit to reveal planned investment in the US. American technology giants on Tuesday revealed plans for multi-billion-dollar investments into Britain’s AI sector. Microsoft led the way, saying it would pump $30 billion into the UK over four years, while Google said it planned investment of nearly $7 billion over the next two years. It comes as GSK rivals pulled the plug in the past week on major pharmaceutical projects planned for the UK. US group Merck dropped plans to build a $1.4-billion research centre in Britain, blaming the country’s ‘lack of investment’ in the sector and ‘undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments’. British pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has meanwhile paused expansion of its research site in university city Cambridge. In July, however, AstraZeneca said it would invest $50 billion in the US by 2030. ‘GSK will be hoping that in following AstraZeneca... they will help to avoid any sector-specific tariffs that might otherwise be coming their way,’ noted Steve Clayton, head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/276341/british-drugs-giant-gsk-vows-30b-us-investment", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 383},

After the Jumma prayers, they brought out a procession from the central mosque and later joined a rally in front of the graveyard of martyred Professor Dr Shamsuzzoha. Protesters at the rally said that the ward quota was a settled issue and must not be brought back ‘under any name or form’. Salahuddin Ammar, a former coordinator of the Student Against Discrimination, said that with the university central students’ union elections a few days ahead, a section of the university’s teaching and other staff was trying to bring the ward quota back using the elections as cover. ‘We are making it clear that RUCSU elections will be held, but the ward quota will never rise from the grave,’ he said. Law and land administration student Kamrul Hasan, alleging that the university authorities did not want the RUCSU election, said, ‘That is why they have reinstated the ward quota just days before the polls scheduled for September 25’. Mass communication and journalism student Mahir Faisal said threatened to launch a fierce movement against the ward quota reinstatement just as they did to oust the fascist Awami League regime. ‘If necessary, we are ready to give our blood again. But we will never allow anyone to bring back the ward quota,’ he warned. Earlier in the day, vice-chancellor Professor Saleh Hasan Naqib told journalists after Jumma prayers that the announcement by teachers, officers and employees of a work abstention from September 21 had raised concerns about the polls. ‘That is why the academic council sub-committee on admission made this decision,’ he said, adding, ‘But ultimately, what students want will prevail, because we want a peaceful university’. On January 2, the university administration abolished the ward quota facility for undergraduate admission enjoyed by the children and grandchildren of teachers, officers and other employees of the university. The administration cancelled the quota after students confined the vice-chancellor, pro-vice-chancellors and other officials inside the administration building for 12 hours on January 2, demanding its cancellation. Previously, a 5 per cent quota was reserved for the children and grandchildren of the RU teachers, officers and other employees for taking admission to the university’s undergraduate courses. But in early August, a section of teachers, officers and employees launched a movement demanding reinstatement of the facility. They also announced that from September 21 they would go for a full work abstention programme under which academic and administrative activities would also be boycotted if their demand was not met.

The ruling junta has increased air strikes year-on-year since the start of the country’s civil war, conflict monitors say, after seizing power in a 2021 coup ending a decade-long experiment with democracy. The United Nations on Thursday demanded an investigation, saying the attack could constitute a war crime.

According to official data and press release published by the CPA on Monday, the port handled 2,849,542 TEUs of containers, 11,50,67,200 metric tonnes of cargo, and 3,552 vessels in the first 10 months (January–October) of the 2025 calendar year. These posted a 4.87 per cent rise in container handling, 12.64 per cent growth in cargo handling, and a 10.97 per cent increase in vessel handling compared with the same period last year. During this time, the port processed 132,328 more TEUs, 129,08,174 more tonnes of cargo, and 351 additional vessels. Moreover, during the first four months (July–October) of the financial year 2025–26, the port recorded 1,213,805 TEUs, 4,52,82,907 tonnes of cargo, and 1,422 vessels, which marked a year-on-year increase of 10.15 per cent in containers, 15.76 per cent in cargo, and 11 per cent in vessel handling. Compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year, the port handled 111,888 more TEUs, 61,66,405 more tonnes of cargo, and 141 more vessels, the port data, signed by its secretary, stated. At the New Mooring Container Terminal, operated by Chittagong Dry Dock Limited, performance has also improved notably as in the first four months of FY 2025–26, the terminal handled 468,871 TEUs and 253 vessels, showing 15.50 per cent growth in container throughput and 19.35 per cent growth in vessel handling. This represented an increase of 62,919 TEUs and 41 vessels compared with the corresponding period last fiscal year. Chattogram Port also witnessed a marked reduction in vessel waiting time over the period. According to the port data, ships experienced zero waiting time on 9 days in September, 18 days in October, and 19 days in November, and received berths immediately upon arrival. CPA said that this has enabled importers to take delivery of goods much faster, while exporters have been able to load outbound cargo on schedule. Moreover, the resulting improvement has shortened the port’s overall lead time, a change that is expected to ease consumer prices and further accelerate the country’s export competitiveness, the authority added. The officials of the port also attributed the port’s improved efficiency to the addition of modern cargo and container-handling equipment, expansion of yard capacity, increased digitalisation, and the dedicated efforts of port officials, workers, and stakeholders. They also said that continued user cooperation across levels has contributed to sustained growth. ‘A delegation from Maersk, which travelled from Singapore to Chattogram recently, expressed satisfaction with the port’s operational progress, particularly the reduction in vessel waiting times and improved performance across NCT and other terminals,’ said the press release. The port officials also said that the port’s achievements would further enhance the image and open new horizons for future port management and development. According to the CPA, the port, Bangladesh’s main gateway for international trade, handles nearly 92 per cent of the nation›s general import–export cargo and about 98 per cent of all containerised goods.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/283164/chattogram-port-records-strong-growth-in-cargo-container-and-vessel-handling", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 507},
{"title": "Division over establishment of univ intensifies", "body": "Division of opinion over establishing proposed Dhaka Central University has intensified, as groups of students and teachers for and against the university on Wednesday staged separate demonstrations, blocking streets in the capital’s New Market area. The street demonstrations disrupted traffic movement from about 11:00am to about 4:00pm in the area, causing huge suffering to the commuters. A group of students, including the students of tertiary level education of seven government colleges that were previously affiliated with Dhaka University, jointly with the students undergoing the admission process at the proposed university warned that they would hold a sit-in from December 7 if the ordinance for establishing the proposed university did not come by today. They announced the premises of Shikkha Bhaban, head office of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education, as the venue for the sit-in demonstration. Meanwhile on the day, a group of students of tertiary level education of the Eden Mohila College, a group of Higher Secondary Certificate students of Dhaka College, teachers of the seven government colleges also staged demonstrations on the streets and on the campuses of their respective institutions, opposing the structure of the proposed university. The government, on November 18, decided in principle to establish Dhaka Central University merging the tertiary level education of the seven colleges following a longstanding student movement for a university combining the seven colleges. Nearly 100 students of Eden Mohila College staged a sit-in on the street in front of the campus gate from about 11:00am to 1:30pm, halting traffic on the New Market-Azimpur road stretch, pressing a five-point demand, including reserving Eden Mohila College only for women. Demanding immediate issuance of the ordinance of the proposed university, several thousand students of the seven government colleges gathered on Dhaka College campus on Wednesday morning and brought out a protest procession from the campus just after 12:45pm. They marched on the roads in Science Laboratory, New Market and Azimpur area and ended the demonstration with a rally and press conference about 4:00pm in front of the Dhaka College gate. At the press conference, Dhaka College student Abdur Rahman alleged a syndicate was conspiring to foil the establishment of the university. ‘We will hold a morning-to-evening sit-in on the Shikkha Bhaban premises on Sunday (December 7), if the ordinance for the proposed university is not published by Thursday,’ announced Abdur Rahman, one of the movement coordinators, threatening that their sit-in would continue until the ordinance was issued. A tense situation arose in the area as the opposing group of students and teachers of Eden Mohila College left the street at about 1:30pm and marched to Dhaka College. They entered the Dhaka College campus and staged demonstration in front of the office of AKM Elias, interim administrator of the proposed university and Dhaka College principal. Police personnel were seen stand in guard in front of the college gate at the time. Meanwhile, teachers of the seven colleges also formed human chains on their respective campuses, opposing the structure of the proposed university and demanding that new university must not harm the distinct characteristics of each of the seven institutions.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/284093/division-over-establishment-of-univ-intensifies", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 517},

Defence counsel Amir Hossain made the argument during his closing submissions in the crimes against humanity case against Hasina, Asaduzzaman, both hiding in India, and Mamun over their alleged superior command responsibilities for the July uprising which left around 1,400 people dead and more than 25,000 injured. Chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam is scheduled for today to respond to the defence arguments, followed by the attorney general Md Asaduzzaman’s final remarks before the tribunal sets a date for verdict delivery, according to prosecution sources. During the hearing, tribunal chair Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder asked, ‘Why are the other accused not coming forward to defend themselves?’ In reply, Amir said that the former IGP ‘covered up his own wrongdoing’ by blaming others. The tribunal observed that Mamun did not conceal his role but rather confessed to his involvement. Amir argued that the IGP’s claim that orders for the use of force came from the prime minister was false and made only to protect himself. The prosecution, however, maintained that Sheikh Hasina had directly ordered the use of lethal force to suppress the July movement. Amir rejected Mamun’s testimony, saying it was self-serving and unreliable. The tribunal said that it would examine whether the former IGP met the legal conditions required to qualify as a state approver.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/279909/ict-to-examine-if-ex-igp-mamun-eligible-to-be-state-evidence", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 271},
{"title": "China’s factory activity shrinks for seventh straight month", "body": "China’s factory activity shrank for a seventh straight month in October, official data showed Friday, as trade uncertainty ahead of talks between president Xi Jinping and US leader Donald Trump weighed on the economic powerhouse. The manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index — a key measure of industrial health — came in at 49.0, marking another contraction, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The reading missed a forecast of 49.6 by a Bloomberg survey of economists and was down 0.8 percentage points from the previous month. Manufacturing in October slowed ‘due to factors such as... the more complex international environment’, said NBS statistician Huo Lihui in a statement. Huo also attributed part of the slowdown to China’s ‘Golden Week’ National Day holiday this month, a period that usually sees slower factory activity. The country’s overall economic output ‘remained generally stable’, he added. October’s reading equalled the lowest level of factory activity this year, matching the 49.0 figure in April. That month kicked off a streak of contraction as factories dealt with ebbs and flows of a US-China trade war. ‘The economic momentum has weakened’ since the middle of the year, wrote economist Zhiwei Zhang of Pinpoint Asset Management. But after negotiations with the United States ‘went successfully... I think the macro policy in China will stay unchanged for the rest of this year’, he said. The leaders of the world’s two largest economies met on Thursday in South Korea for high-stakes trade talks. Trump said he would halve a 20-per cent tariff on Chinese goods and Xi agreed to suspend certain export restrictions on the key rare-earth sector for one year. China would also resume purchases of US soya beans after orders came to a halt this harvest season, according to Trump.

The incident took place at about 11:00pm near the university’s main gate along the Dhaka–Aricha highway. The detained buses of ‘Selfie Paribahan’ were later parked at the university’s central playground, students said. The victim Safayet Islam is a student of the 51st batch of the accounting and information systems department of the university. Describing the incident, Safayet said, ‘I boarded a Dhaka-bound bus, but midway, the staff stopped the vehicle and tried to force all passengers to get off, citing a lack of passengers.’ ‘When I refused to get down, the driver and helper attacked me.

{"title": "Bangladesh find positives despite failing to qualify", "body": "Bangladesh’s hopes of qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 were practically over following India’s loss to Singapore and Bangladesh’s draw against Hong Kong in their respective two Group C qualifying games on Tuesday. Despite failing to qualify for the Asia Cup, Bangladesh can take away some positives from their qualifier campaign, as they fought hard in each game, forcing Hong Kong to play ultra-defensive for at least 20 minutes on Tuesday. At the Kai Tak Stadium, captain Matthew Orr gave Hong Kong the lead in the 36th minute with a penalty before Rakib Hossain restored the parity six minutes from the stipulated time for Bangladesh. On the other hand, Singapore earned a comeback win following a brace from midfielder Song Ui-young (44th, 58th) after midfielder Lallianzuala Chhangte (14th) gave India the lead. As only the group champions from the 24-team qualifiers will advance to the final stage, both Bangladesh and India were out of the top place race after Tuesday’s outcome. Even though Bangladesh and India both have two points from four games, the former is in third place in the table with a better goal difference. Bangladesh earlier played a goalless draw away to India before losing to Singapore 2-1 and 4-3 against Hong Kong at home. Spanish coach Javier Cabrera’s charges will host India on November 18 before facing Singapore away on March 31, 2026. But neither Bangladesh nor India have any chances even if they win their remaining two games, as top-placed Hong Kong and second-placed Singapore have eight points each from their four outings. They also have two games to play. Bangladesh’s fighting spirit was seen very much visible during their home game against Hong Kong as well. In the match, Bangladesh took the lead with Hamza Choudhury’s 13th-minute free kick but went 3-1 down within the 75th. They fought hard to make a comeback and tied the game 3-3 with goals from Shekh Morsalin (84th) and Shamit Shome in injury time, but the jubilation lasted only two minutes until hat-trick hero Raphael Merkies broke Bangladesh’s hearts with a last-gasp strike in the seven-goal thriller. Bangladesh also made a comeback against Singapore as Rakib scored in the 67th minute after Song Ui-young (45th) and Ikhsan Ahmed (58th) scored once each for their side. Despite widespread criticism of Cabrera’s team selections, which include never calling custodian Anisur Rahman Zico to the final squad since November 2024, there is no disputing that Bangladesh’s fighting spirit has matured since Leicester City midfielder Hamza began representing Bangladesh. Hamza’s debut for Bangladesh against India in March of this year encouraged three other overseas players to join the team: Shamit Shom from Canada, Fahamedul Islam from Italy, and Zayyan Ahmed from the United States.

{"title": "Battered US businesses eye improved China trade at Shanghai expo", "body": "Plying everything from handbags to salt in a cavernous Shanghai exhibition hall, US exporters hit by the trade war with China said Thursday they hope improving bilateral relations will bring much-needed stability. After spending much of this year in a tit-for-tat tariff escalation, the United States and China have agreed to walk back from some punitive measures after a meeting last week between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. At the annual China International Import Expo (CIIE), US ginseng seller Ming Tao Jiang told AFP multiple rounds of duties imposed since Trump’s first presidential term had ‘decimated’ growers in central Wisconsin state. ‘Before 2018 we had 200 registered growers in Wisconsin, in Marathon County... after the first and second round of tariff wars, adding insult to injury of Covid, we’re down to 70,’ said Jiang, founder of the Marathon Ginseng company. ‘With the recent agreement between the two governments, I think things are stabilised, we’re looking for a better potential in the future,’ Jiang added. The North American variety of the aromatic root ginseng, believed to have medicinal properties in traditional Asian cultures, was one of the first products shipped by the United States to China in the 1780s. US and Chinese authorities have sporadically slapped retaliatory tariffs on each other’s ginseng products since 2018, with Jiang saying his goods currently face a 45 per cent import duty in China. ‘We’re here trying to keep our tradition going for the local economy,’ he told AFP. Other US exhibitors echoed Jiang’s cautious optimism, as visitors sampled Chinese-style baijiu liquor made from American rice and browsed stalls advertising cornbread mixes and California almonds. Tara Qu is a trade representative in China for Idaho state who on Thursday oversaw the ceremonial signing of a purchase agreement between a Chinese maker of salted duck eggs and dynamite. ‘I think the tariff decrease can help a little bit,’ Qu told AFP, referring to the recent agreement by China and the United States to suspend additional tariffs on each other’s goods. But as Beijing continues to levy a 10 per cent blanket tariff on US imports, ‘we hope there will be a further reduction, so that trade can go back to normal’, Qu said. Qu added that US companies fear that Chinese buyers spooked by the trade war will turn to alternative suppliers from other countries. She pointed to Anderson Northwest, an Idahoan producer of beans and pulses, as a CIIE exhibitor hit especially hard by tariffs this year. ‘Since the tariffs increased by 20 per cent, they haven’t exported any of their products to China,’ Qu said. Eric Zheng, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, told AFP: ‘We certainly hope that there will be more reductions in tariffs, because tariffs are hurting everybody.’ ‘We have a long way to go to lower tariffs on (chamber) members,’ Zheng said, noting that Californian wines, for example, are currently subject to over 100 per cent in Chinese import duties. Throughout the trade war, ‘it was very difficult to plan for the long term,’ Zheng said. Zheng welcomes planned visits by Trump and Xi to each other’s countries next year. ‘With those political events in place, I think we’ll see (a) more stable environment, at least in the next year, if not beyond,’ Zheng said. ‘That’s welcome news for us’.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/281380/battered-us-businesses-eye-improved-china-trade-at-shanghai-expo", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 554},

The fisheries department has leased out some parts of the river for pisciculture, categorising it as a closed water body or bil. However, once upon a time it was known as a Baromasia river for its all season flow. Once boats used to sail and riverbank erosion was common. Thousands of people used to live across its banks. Fishing was common among locals. There were many stations and ghats for waterway travellers for their landing and crossing. Locals said lack of dredging merged the river with the plain land. Climate change is also one of the reasons behind it. Fishermen now opted to cultivation in char areas. Local people use bamboo-made foot-bridge to cross the river. The Baromasia River, originated from a lake in Indian Cooch Behar district, entered Bangladesh through Gorkamandap border of Phulbari upazila of Kurigram. It is called the Baromasia River in Bangladesh part with a length of about 10 kilometres. The Baromasia joined the Dharla River in Sonaikaji area under Phulbari upazila. Locals identified the ‘negligence of authorities’ as one of the main reasons for losing its existence. The existence of the river was found in the British era map. But, it has not been identified as a river in any survey of the government after British rule. Even the Baromasia River is not found in the list of 54 recognised transboundary rivers flowing from India to Bangladesh. As a result, it remains even more neglected. Now, the Baromasia River becomes a crop field. A small canal is flowing in the middle. Locals still call it Baromasia River. Farmers produce paddy, pulses, bananas, and various vegetable on more than a hundred small chars emerged on the riverbeds. No water flow in the river made it into a three-season arable land, popular for producing aush, aman and boro crop along with various types of corns, fruits and vegetables. Only during the monsoon, water accumulates in the low laying areas and submerges neighborhoods causing floods even in low rainfall. Kabirul Islam of Krishnananda area is a local farmer live on the vicinity of the river. He cultivated brinjal on two bighas of land in the Baromasia char this year. ‘I hope best harvesting of my crop as there was no rain this year,’ he said adding he planted samplings of brinjal in advance to get good price of this produces He also cultivated a lot of corns in the Uddin char of the Shimulbari area….the new soil is good for cultivation, he said. Farmer Abu Hanif said the beel is feasible for multi crop culture. Asked about the problem due to lean river, Abu Hanif said, its caused problem for the fishermen, who were forced to change their occupation. Govinda Chandra Roy of Krishnananda Bakshi area at Gorakhmandal said transportation is another problem for them. The Phulbari upazila agriculture office said about 15,000 hectares of arable land in the river basin, including Dharla and Baromasia, have been brought under cultivation. Farmers grow three crops a year, he said. Locals said thousands of families lost their homes for river erosion while thousands of others have lost their water based occupation after their river dried up. Now they do various works in different places, while many boatmen now ply auto-rickshaws, he said. Shahidul Islam, a local union parishad member, blamed local fishery office for turning the river into a drain. ‘There is a water flow from the border to Intur Ghat. But fisheries department leased it out for fish farming showing it as a closed water body,’ he said. As an open water body every local people was supposed to catch fish in the river. But, now none is allowed for fishing as it has been leased out to a particular person as a bil.’ Tuhin Wadud of Riverine People, a non-government organisation, said Baromasia was a big transboundary river. But, lack of maintenance caused drying up the river. He said, the river needs to be recognised as a transboundary one. Then, if it is dredged scientifically, its flow can be restored. For this, the government needs to come forward.’ Naodanga Union Parishad chairman Hasen Ali said local people had to suffer a lot due to death of the river. It made thousands of people unemployed. Executive engineer of Kurigram Water Development Board Rakibul Hasan said, ‘Last year, the river has been included in the list of 38 rivers in Kurigram. We are currently working with the major rivers. However, we are also thinking what can be done about the small ones.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/278002/locals-demand-revival-of-baromasia-river", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 774},
{"title": "Cabinet likely to take up issue in next meeting", "body": "The interim government is likely to take up the issues of implementing the July Charter and fix the timing for the proposed referendum at the next advisory council meeting to be held on Thursday. The likely move comes on the heel of the expiry of the seven-day period set by the government for the political parties to resolve the matter ended on Sunday without any success. Several advisers and officials at the Chief Adviser’s Office confirmed the development. An emergency council meeting on November 2, chaired by chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, urged the political parties to reach consensus in a week on the key aspects of the July Charter and the timing of the referendum. The council had cautioned that should the parties fail to agree the government would move forward independently. However, the week-long opportunity went in vein amid persistent political disagreements, underscoring the deep divisions in the country’s political landscape. With the exception of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, most parties criticised the government’s directive to them to ‘go and discuss’, describing the instruction as politically inappropriate and procedurally flawed. Although the Jamaat attempted to convene discussions among parties, the effort saw little traction. Major political actors, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, declined to take part in such discussions, arguing that the government should have issued formal invitations. The party further demanded that any dialogue process must guarantee that the upcoming Jatiya Sangsad elections would be held on schedule. BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Sunday at a meeting in Thakurgaon said that some educated individuals from the United States were coming and imposing issues such as a referendum and a charter on the people of Bangladesh. He said that people did not understand the referendum or the July Charter — they simply wanted to vote. The National Citizen Party also expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s approach, warning that the method of consultations had created a fresh stalemate and could escalate tensions. NCP leaders maintained that the responsibility for initiating and facilitating meaningful dialogue lay with the government, not the political parties. The Ganatantra Mancha alliance echoed similar concerns, saying that disputes over implementing the July Charter and conducting a national referendum could not be resolved through street demonstrations or informal exchanges alone. The alliance emphasised that the government must act proactively and frame a solution that reflects broad political consensus. NCP member secretary Akter Hossen on Sunday urged the government not to shift the responsibility for implementing reforms onto the political parties. He said the parties had already held discussions and the National Consensus Commission had reached a decision, adding that it should now be implemented without delay to resolve the political crisis and ensure public participation in the elections. Urging the government further, Akhter said that the people wanted to see swift and effective steps to implement the July Charter. Meanwhile, the Jamaat and seven other Islamic parties will hold a joint rally at Dhaka’s Paltan intersection on November 11, demanding the implementation of the July Charter and urging the government to announce the date for a referendum on the Charter by 10 November. A preparatory meeting was held at the central office of Islami Andolan Bangladesh on Sunday to finalise arrangements for the previously declared joint movement.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/281704/cabinet-likely-to-take-up-issue-in-next-meeting", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 543},
{"title": "Unsealed Epstein files name famous figures", "body": "The US justice department on Friday began releasing a long-awaited cache of records from its investigations into the politically explosive case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein—though much of the material remained heavily redacted. Among the trove are numerous photographs depicting former Democratic president Bill Clinton and other luminaries, including Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson, in Epstein’s social circle. The sweeping blackouts across many of the documents—combined with tight control over the release by officials in president Donald Trump’s administration—stoked scepticism over whether this disclosure will silence conspiracy theories of a high-level cover-up. In one example, seven pages listing 254 masseuses have every name buried beneath thick black bars alongside the note, ‘redacted to protect potential victim information.’ Even so, the files shed some light on the disgraced financier’s intimate ties to the rich, famous and powerful—Trump among them. At least one file contains dozens of censored images of naked or scantily clad figures. Others show Epstein and companions, their faces obscured, posing with firearms. Previously unseen photographs include Maxwell with disgraced former prince Andrew, pictured lying across the legs of five people. Another photo shows a youthful-looking Clinton lounging in a hot tub, part of the image blacked out. In another, Clinton swims alongside a dark-haired woman who appears to be Epstein’s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. The White House wasted no time seizing on Clinton’s appearances. ‘Slick Willy! @BillClinton just chillin, without a care in the world. Little did he know...’ communications director Steven Cheung posted on X. Clinton’s deputy chief of staff Angel Urena responded to the newly released files by saying the country ‘expects answers, not scapegoats.’ ‘The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about shielding themselves,’ Urena wrote in a statement posted to X. Democrats voiced frustration that the release fell far short of what was mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The new federal law required the government’s entire case file be posted publicly by Friday, constrained only by legal and victim privacy concerns. ‘This set of heavily redacted documents released by the department of justice today [Friday] is just a fraction of the whole body of evidence,’ said senate minority leader Chuck Schumer. ‘Simply releasing a mountain of blacked-out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out.’ Other Democrats in Congress said the government had withheld a draft indictment prepared after the financier’s 2019 arrest, which they say would implicate ‘other rich and powerful men who were on Epstein’s rape island.’ Trump, who once counted his Palm Beach, Florida neighbour as a close friend, spent months trying to block the disclosure of the files, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The Republican president ultimately bowed to mounting pressure from Congress—including members of his own party—and last month signed the law compelling publication of the materials by Friday. Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said several hundred thousand documents would be published on deadline day, with more to follow in coming weeks. Prosecutors retain discretion to withhold material tied to active investigations, and Blanche said files had also been redacted to protect the identities of Epstein’s hundreds of victims. Trump once moved in the same Palm Beach and New York party scene as Epstein, appearing with him at events throughout the 1990s. He severed ties years before Epstein’s 2019 arrest and faces no accusations of wrongdoing in the case. But his right-wing base has long fixated on the Epstein saga and conspiracy theories alleging the financier ran a sex trafficking ring for the global elite. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to release all the files. Yet after returning to office, he dismissed the transparency push as a ‘Democrat hoax.’ Trump’s justice department ignited a political firestorm in July with a memo declaring there would be no further disclosures from the Epstein probe and his fabled ‘client list’ did not exist before the president bowed to pressure. Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, remains the only person convicted in connection with his crimes, and is serving a 20-year sentence for recruiting underage girls for the former teacher and banker, whose death was ruled a suicide.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/285729/unsealed-epstein-files-name-famous-figures", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 720},
{"title": "Jobless youth in failing system", "body": "BANGLADESH faces an alarming paradox. Although the economy is growing steadily, it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to find employment. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, roughly 1.94 million young people aged 15–29 — about 7.2 per cent of this age group’s labour force — are now out of work. At the same time, the employment-to-population ratio for males aged 15 to 24 dropped to roughly 47.2 per cent in 2022. Underemployment and poor job quality further compound the challenges faced by this generation. This situation requires more than cosmetic policy adjustments. It reveals a deep failure at the intersection of education, labour-market design and broader development strategy. While there is much rhetoric about ‘youth empowerment’ and ‘skills development,’ the lived reality for Bangladesh’s job-hungry young people is one of frustration, disappointment and mounting social risk. Bangladesh has made notable progress in expanding access to higher education, yet the mismatch between education and employment opportunities remains persistent and damaging. One study found that the unemployment rate for young people with a tertiary degree rose from 9.7 per cent in 2013 to 27.8 per cent in 2022. The message is clear: obtaining a degree is no longer a reliable pathway to employment, and in many cases, may even increase the likelihood of joblessness. The government and higher-education institutions continue to promote the notion that higher education guarantees ‘good jobs’, yet they fail to ensure that academic programmes align with industry needs. As a result, graduates lack the cognitive, technical and meta-skills required in fast-changing sectors. Job creation remains insufficient and poorly directed. Despite years of impressive GDP growth, job creation has not kept pace with the rising numbers of young people entering the labour market. The International Labour Organisation reports that 16.8 per cent of youths are unemployed (14.8 per cent of young men and 22.7 per cent of young women), and that 30.9 per cent of young people are not in employment, education, or training. The gap between macroeconomic growth and youth employment points to a structural disconnect: growth has been driven by capital- and labour-intensive industries that rely on low-wage manufacturing or services, rather than high-productivity sectors capable of absorbing educated workers. Informality, limited job availability and rural–urban disparities further aggravate the problem. Much of Bangladesh’s employment remains informal, seasonal, or marginal. The Bureau of Statistics reports that 80.7 per cent of unemployed young people live in rural areas. Additionally, only 47.2 per cent of males aged 15–24 are currently employed, meaning vast numbers of youths remain outside productive engagement. Underemployment, working fewer hours than desired or in positions below one’s skill level, is widespread, even though it rarely appears in headline indicators. It nonetheless poses a significant barrier to the aspirations of young people. Institutional inertia and implementation gaps remain major obstacles. Government initiatives such as the Skills for Employment Investment Programme were created to provide market-relevant skills. In practice, however, coordination among training providers, industry and employment agencies remains weak; distorted incentives favour enrolment numbers over meaningful job placement; and the regulatory environment does little to address job-quality concerns or skill mismatches. A generation of educated, ambitious young people who are increasingly uncertain about their prospects constitutes a profound socio-political risk. When tens of thousands of graduates see few pathways to dignified work, their discontent becomes a latent threat to social cohesion, democratic stability and long-term national resilience. Treating youth employment as a by-product of growth rather than a central policy objective is dangerously negligent. First, education reform must be comprehensive. Curriculums should be redesigned to emphasise cognitive flexibility, digital literacies, critical thinking and stronger collaboration with industry to ensure alignment with labour-market needs. Second, job-creation policy must shift from quantity to quality. Incentives should support industries that generate higher value, incorporate domestic technology and deepen integration into global value chains. Third, data and policy-feedback systems must improve. Instead of relying solely on headline unemployment figures, policy should be informed by regular surveys on underemployment, job-matching effectiveness and youth job satisfaction. Fourth, inclusive spatial strategies are essential. With rural youths experiencing higher unemployment and lower labour-force participation, programmes must integrate urban and rural opportunities through improved connectivity, decentralised investment and tailored vocational pathways. Finally, institutional governance must be strengthened. Training systems, placement agencies, labour regulators and industry-academia linkages must be held accountable for outcomes, not merely processes. The stark reality that some 1.94 million Bangladeshi youths aged 15 to 29 are unemployed, despite claims of a ‘jobs-rich growth phase,’ exposes the collective failure of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the ministry of labour and employment and the ministry of education. Their inability to respond effectively has left graduates stranded, with data showing that 31.5 per cent of unemployed youths hold tertiary qualifications. The curriculum remains disconnected from labour-market realities; skills-development programmes prioritise enrolment over employment; and the government’s fixation on growth rates obscures the deteriorating quality of available jobs. The labour market is predominantly informal, underemployment is rampant and large rural-urban disparities persist. Regulatory bodies continue to produce credentialled youth without addressing cognitive gaps or ensuring alignment with global value chains. Without stringent accountability mechanisms for training institutes and industry-academia partnerships, official rhetoric about ‘youth empowerment’ remains hollow. Bangladesh risks squandering its demographic dividend and imperilling an entire generation unless the government, ministries and educational institutions implement urgent reforms in curricula, governance and job-creation strategies. In short, youth unemployment in Bangladesh is not a temporary fluctuation; it is a structural failure at the heart of the country’s development model. Unless policymakers, educators and businesses revise their assumptions, realign incentives and invest in genuine outcomes, an entire generation will face deepening exclusion. An,d Bangladesh will forfeit the human-capital dividend it claims to be building. Bold, consistent and coordinated action is now imperative.

{"title": "Bangladeshi workers demand compensation for abuse in Malaysia", "body": "Bangladeshi migrant rights groups have demanded immediate action to ensure justice, fair compensation and payment of overdue wages for Bangladeshi workers allegedly subjected to abuse by two Malaysian companies — Mediceram and Kawaguchi. The call came during a human chain organised on Monday in front of the Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment by the Migrant Welfare Network Malaysia and a Bangladesh-based expatriate rights platform. Speakers at the programme compared the exploitation faced by workers at the two firms to modern-day slavery, blaming both the Bangladesh High Commission in Malaysia and the Expatriates’ Welfare Ministry for failing to protect the victims. Workers who had been employed at Mediceram alleged that they were subjected to delayed payments, threats, physical abuse, and inhumane living conditions for years. The company allegedly confiscated their passports, and many workers became undocumented as their work permits were not renewed. In early November, the company reportedly forcibly deported 15 workers who had demanded renewal of their permits and payment of back wages. Meanwhile, workers from Kawaguchi said that they had been facing irregular salary payments since 2022 and went seven months without pay as of September 2024. Although some compensation was given, most have yet to receive their full dues. The company’s owner reportedly shut down operations without paying 30 lakh ringgit in arrears owed to 251 workers. The protesting workers presented seven demands, including immediate compensation for those forcibly deported from Mediceram, a halt to all forced repatriations, and assistance in transferring affected workers to responsible employers through proper legal channels. They also called for a ban on hiring Bangladeshi workers by Mediceram and its associated companies, and demanded full payment of overdue wages from Kawaguchi. Besides, the protesters urged reforms in the operations of the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur to make it more migrant-friendly and called for a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s recruitment and migration system, emphasising the protection of workers’ rights over remittance inflow.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/281747/bangladeshi-workers-demand-compensation-for-abuse-in-malaysia", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 324},

{"title": "Hasina’s will ended caretaker system, lawyer tells SC", "body": "The Supreme Court Appellate Division on Thursday continued for the third day the hearing on a series of appeals and review petitions challenging its 2011 verdict that had annulled the election-time caretaker government system. During the day’s proceedings, petitioner lawyer Shishir Manir, representing the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, told the court that the caretaker government system was abolished due to the arbitrary decision of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, not based on constitutional provisions or expert recommendations. A seven-member bench, headed by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, heard the appeals and review petitions and fixed October 28 for next hearing. Manir argued that the then Awami League government formed a special parliamentary committee in 2010 to review constitutional amendments and consulted stakeholders on the issue. ‘None of the experts or members of the committee recommended abolishing the caretaker system. It was eliminated only by one person’s (Hasina’s) arbitrary decision,’ he told the court. He further said that 10 of the 14 SC judges had expressed support for retaining the caretaker system, but the decision of four judges led to its abolition. ‘The verdict created an autocratic rule and destroyed the country’s politics and society, turning parliament into a house of flattery,’ said Manir. He also told the court that the abolition of the caretaker system led to one-sided elections, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and execution of opposition leaders. The lawyer also argued that the caretaker system could be automatically revived through a verdict of the Appellate Division, though it could not be implemented before the upcoming national elections. Opposing any court-issued directive or guideline on the matter, Manir said that such directives might create obstacles to implementing electoral reforms and the July Charter as a proposal regarding the caretaker government was recommended in the charter. He said that the then Appellate Division committed an error by altering the short order delivered in the open court regarding the caretaker system and adding new concepts to the full judgment released 16 months later, terming it politically motivated. Manir maintained that the abolition of the caretaker system was ‘pre-planned and designed by the then regime,’ adding that the system itself strengthened democracy and did not violate the constitution’s basic structure. Earlier on Tuesday, lawyer Sharif Bhuiyan concluded his two-day arguments that began on Monday on behalf of five eminent citizens, including Badiul Alam Majumdar, secretary of Sushashoner Jonno Nagorik. On August 27, the Appellate Division allowed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and five citizens, including Badiul Alam Majumdar, to move separate appeals against the 2011 verdict that cancelled the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The BNP, the Jamaat, five citizens, and freedom fighter Mofazzal Islam had filed review petitions last year after the fall of the AL regime on August 5, 2024, amid a student-led uprising that brought the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus to power. The 13th Amendment was declared void on May 10, 2011, while the 15th Amendment, passed on June 30, 2011, formally abolished the caretaker government system.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/280003/hasinas-will-ended-caretaker-system-lawyer-tells-sc", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 496},

{"title": "Venezuela accuses US of waging ‘war’", "body": "Venezuela on Friday accused the United States of waging an ‘undeclared war’ in the Caribbean and called for a UN probe of American strikes that have killed over a dozen alleged drug traffickers on boats in recent weeks. Washington has deployed warships to international waters off Venezuela’s coast, backed by F-35 fighters sent to Puerto Rico in what it calls an anti-drug operation. ‘It is an undeclared war, and you can already see how people, whether or not they are drug traffickers, have been executed in the Caribbean Sea. Executed without the right to a defence,’ defence minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said as he attended a military exercise in response to the US ‘threat.’ His remarks came just hours before US President Donald Trump announced another military strike on a boat, claiming three more alleged ‘narcoterrorists’ were killed, bringing the total number of deaths in recent weeks to 17. He did not say when the attack took place, and only specified that it occurred in the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The strikes have prompted debate over the legality of the killings, with drug trafficking itself not a capital offense under US law. Washington has also not provided specific details to back up its claims that the boats targeted have actually been trafficking drugs. Venezuelan attorney general Tarek William Saab claimed that ‘the use of missiles and nuclear weapons to murder defenceless fishermen on a small boat are crimes against humanity that must be investigated by the UN.’ The biggest US naval deployment in the Caribbean in decades has stoked fears the United States is planning to attack Venezuelan territory. On Wednesday, Venezuela launched three days of military exercises on its Caribbean island of La Orchila in response to the perceived threat from a US flotilla of seven ships and a nuclear-powered submarine. La Orchila is close to the area where the United States intercepted and held a Venezuelan fishing vessel for eight hours over the weekend. Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, whom the United States does not recognize as legitimate and accuses of running a drug cartel, has urged citizens to join militia training to ‘defend the homeland.’ Late Thursday, he announced that troops will provide residents of low-income neighbourhoods with weapons training. Maduro, for whom Washington has issued a $50 million bounty on drug trafficking charges, suspects the Trump administration of planning an invasion in pursuit. Trump had said on Tuesday that US forces ‘knocked off’ three boats crossing the Caribbean, but Washington only provided details and video footage of two of the strikes. Maduro accused the United States of hatching ‘an imperial plan for regime change and to impose a US puppet government... to come and steal our oil.’ He has repeatedly vowed Caracas will exercise its ‘legitimate right to defend itself’ against US aggression. Opposition figure Henrique Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate and staunch Maduro critic, said Friday he would not support any US invasion. ‘I continue to believe that the solution is not military, but political,’ he said, adding that Trump’s actions were counterproductive and ‘entrenching those in power.’ He called for the release of nearly a thousand dissidents locked up under Maduro, and for the Venezuelan government to show goodwill in foreign relations.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/latin-america/276653/venezuela-accuses-us-of-waging-war", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 550},
{"title": "Liverpool up for the fight despite City masterclass: Van Dijk", "body": "Virgil van Dijk said Liverpool will fight back after a demoralising 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, but manager Arne Slot conceded the English champions cannot look at the Premier League title race right now. Five defeats in six league games have dropped the Reds down to eighth, eight points behind leaders Arsenal. City showed they are the major threat to the Gunners right now as goals from Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez and Jeremy Doku closed Pep Guardiola’s men to within four points of Arsenal. ‘The reality is that we lost 3-0 and that is a big blow,’ said Liverpool captain Van Dijk. ‘We are not going to give up whatsoever. We are in November and we are ready for a long season and a big fight.’ Decisions did not go Liverpool’s way as Van Dijk had a goal at 1-0 controversially disallowed for Andy Robertson standing offside in front of City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. However, Slot admitted that complaining about that call would only mask the difference in class between the sides at the Etihad. ‘I will not say because of that we lost the game, because at 1-1 if City continued like they were playing, we would have struggled in the second half as well,’ said Slot. Yet, despite their awful run, Liverpool are only two points adrift of Chelsea in third. ‘We need to get results before we can think about that (the title race),’ added the Dutchman. ‘The best way to judge the league table is after 38 games but the next best is after 19 games when we have all played each other. ‘The first focus is getting results, the last thing we should focus on is the title race. We need to improve and that’s obvious.’ A resounding victory allowed Pep Guardiola to celebrate his 1,000th game in management. After a first trophyless season in eight years, a refreshed City look more like their old selves. ‘Last season could not do that,’ said Guardiola. ‘We lost energy. ‘I tried desperately to do anything, but I was not able to make a click to the team, to react and to do it. ‘For many reasons we were not able to do, but it was a good lesson.’ Arsenal’s 10-game winning run and eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions came to an end in Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Sunderland.

Officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension said that till December 18, farmers had brought 78,045 hectares of land under mustard farming against the fixed target of cultivating the oilseeds on 90,568 hectares of land in the region. Although the early varieties of mustard plants are in the flowering stage, sowing of its seeds is still ongoing in the five districts of this region — Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari. ‘The DAE has set a record target of producing 1,46,281 tonnes of mustard seeds from 90,568 hectares of land for Rangpur region during the current 2025-2026 Rabi season,’ said additional director of the DAE for Rangpur region Md Shirajul Islam. Till Thursday, farmers had brought 78,045 hectares of land under mustard farming, which is 86.17 per cent of the fixed farming target. The record target of producing mustard has been fixed aiming at attaining self-reliance on production of edible oils from locally produced mustard and other oilseeds. Being inspired by motivational activities being conducted by the DAE, farmers have by and large cultivated high yielding varieties of mustard like ‘Tori 7’, BARI-9, BARI-14, BARI-15 and BINA-4 on more land across the region to get high yields. The DAE, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute (BARI) and Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) are extending assistance to farmers to make the mustard cultivation programme a success. After getting excellent production with lucrative prices between Tk 4,300 and Tk 4,800 per mound (every 40 kilograms) last year, farmers have been showing their keen interest in cultivating the highly profitable crop this season. Talking to BSS, farmers Abed Hossain, Bakul Mia, Nasir Uddin and Abdul Wahab of different upazilas in Rangpur said they were expecting a bumper production of mustard this season. Farmer Mozammel Hossain of village Najirdigar and Isahaque Ali of village Kathihara in Rangpur Sadar said that many farmers hade sowed mustard seeds after harvesting short duration Aman rice on the same land to enhance crop intensity and reap more profits. ‘We will cultivate Boro rice on the same land after harvesting mustard this season like in the previous years,’ Isahaque Ali added. Deputy director of the DAE’s Burirhat Horticulture Centre in Rangpur Md Abu Sayem said that mustard farming had become popular both on the vast char areas and mainland in recent years. ‘We are expecting a bumper production of mustard as its tender plants are growing superbly and the process of sowing seeds still continues amid favourable climatic conditions,’ he added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/commodities/285608/mustard-farming-target-likely-to-exceed-in-rangpur-region", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 447},

{"title": "CU admin building locked for pro-VC’s resignation", "body": "Several student organisations at Chittagong University on Monday locked the administrative building, demanding the resignation of pro-vice-chancellor (academic) Professor Mohammad Shamim Uddin Khan over his remarks about the 1971 killings of martyred intellectuals. Leaders and activists of the university units of Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, and several other organisations, locked the building at about noon, announcing that they would not open it until the pro-vice-chancellor apologised and stepped down. Indicating at Shamim Uddin Khan’s involvement with the White Panel, which is formed with teachers supporting Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islam, student leaders said that the public university was not run with Jamaat money and branded his statement on the killings of martyred intellectuals as abhorrent. After locking the building, university unit Chhatra Dal general secretary Abdullah Al Noman told the protesters, ‘At a discussion marking Martyred Intellectuals Day, pro-vice-chancellor Shamim Uddin Khan called the Pakistanis “fighters”. But the Pakistani forces killed people in this country and dishonoured our mothers and sisters.’ ‘He must apologise and resign for his statement. We will not remove the lock unless he resigns,’ he said, adding, ‘The university runs on taxpayers’ money, not on Jamaat’s money.’ The same demand was made at the gathering by the leaders of several student organisations, including Ganatantrik Chhatra Council organiser Dhrubo Barua, Biplobi Chhatra Moitri president Jashad Zakir, Atish Dipankar Hall unit vice-president of the Bangladesh Students’ Union Ripul Chakma, Bangladesh Student Federation, and Socialist Students Front. The university authorities were yet to make any statement till Monday evening on the matter. Pro-vice-chancellor Shamim Uddin Khan, also the convener of the university’s White Panel teachers, on Sunday at a discussion organised by the university administration said that it was likely for the Pakistan military to carry out the killing of the Martyrs on December 14 in 1971. At the event titled ‘Free thinking, War of Liberation and the 1971 killing of intellectuals’ held at the vice-chancellor’s office, he told the audience that December 16 was fixed as the day for the Pakistan army to surrender and they were preparing to leave. In a situation when there was no certainty for them to return alive or dead, the idea that the Pakistan army would kill Bangladeshi intellectuals was “absurd”, he stated. He also said that the killing of intellectuals was part of an ‘international conspiracy’, aimed at turning the country into a ‘vassal state’ of another country. The remarks spread on social media and in media reports, triggering strong reactions and debate on the campus. Meanwhile, CU English department students issued a statement castigating the pro-VC’s comments, while outgoing students of the history department also demanded withdrawal of the remarks and announced a boycott of the professor, according to separate statements sent to the media on Monday morning. Also on Monday, outgoing students of the history department, belonging to 2023–24 academic session, attended a farewell programme only after they had been informed that the pro-vice-chancellor would not attend the event as they demanded. The outgoing batch dubbed ‘Hridoye Uddipto-55’ decided on Sunday night that they would boycott the event if he attended as scheduled. Students from the batch told New Age that they went to the venue around 12:00 noon instead of 10:00am, only after department officials informed them that the pro-VC would not join. Agitation began on Sunday night, when Chhatra Dal and left-leaning student organisations brought out a protest procession and held a rally in front of the administrative building at the university, demanding an apology and resignation from the teacher. At the rally, Chittagong University Central Students Union assistant general secretary Ayubur Rahman Toufiq said, ‘Making such a statement while sitting in a post earned through the blood of the martyred intellectuals is a grave insult to the War of Independence.’ ‘Just as we will not allow the spirit of the 2024 mass uprising to be erased, we will not allow 1971 to be erased either,’ he said, demanding the professor’s resignation.

{"title": "Badruddin Umar: beyond tribute, towards struggle–I", "body": "BADRUDDIN Umar — our foremost Marxist politician, intellectual, historian, and critic in Bangladesh and South Asia — departed this world on September 7, 2025, at the age of 93. And yet, who among us can claim with carking certitude that his death was more real than his blazing, truth-telling, incessantly insurrectionary life? The story of Badruddin Umar is, in many ways, the story of an exception. In a country where opportunism and compromise have been too often elevated to the level of virtues, Umar chose to tread a different path. He took the harder, riskier, lonelier road — that of a revolutionary committed to the cause of the people. But who are the ‘people’ for Umar, really? No, the ‘people’ for him are not empty rhetorical invocations or abstract phantoms, endlessly mouthed as they are by middle-class politicians, their obedient lackeys, and corporations themselves. Yes, all of them never tire of speaking in the name of the ‘people.’ But, for Umar, the ‘people’ decisively come to mean workers and peasants — the tireless toiling masses who alone embody the living ‘majority’ (not in a majoritarian sense) of this land. In his own way, Umar represents a paradigmatic combination of theory and practice, gnosis and praxis, conviction and courage. His very life stands as a rebuke to what he himself calls the ‘lumpenbourgeois political culture’ that he otherwise so acutely and accurately analyses in his work, unmasking its hollowness, its opportunism, its incurable anti-people character and content. It is no surprise that Umar’s contributions remain underacknowledged, even though a Festschrift — a commendable commemorative volume of essays called Badruddin Umorer Jeebon o Kaaj (The Life & Work of Badruddin Umar, 2022) — was published on the occasion of his 90th birthday to celebrate his life and work. And it is nothing short of ironic and even deeply revealing that it took an entire mass uprising — our July Uprising of 2024 — for Umar’s relevance to be openly acknowledged. True, Umar could foresee this uprising. Now, suddenly, even those who once spat venom at his name are busy draping themselves in his banner, a spectacle that exposed with comic clarity the hypocrisy of middle-class activists and writers — precisely the breed that Umar characteristically and even clinically dissects in his work. In any event, Umar’s remarkable contributions to the fields of history and historiography, politics, culture, and what one may call ‘the sociology of the everyday’ have never been adequately evaluated, partly because such evaluation would force a confrontation with the ideological bankruptcy of the ruling classes and their middle-class intellectual allies and apparatuses. But Umar’s work lives on as a ‘resource of hope,’ a source of illumination, or a guidepost of reason for all those who seek transformative knowledge and politics in the making of a ‘new’ Bangladesh — a call that resounded during our July uprising itself — one that is grounded in the core principles of our national liberation movement of 1971: equality, justice, and human dignity.Born on December 20, 1931, in Bardhaman, West Bengal, Badruddin Umar earned his first degrees in philosophy from Dhaka University, where he briefly taught as a part-time faculty member before proceeding to Oxford University to receive his honours degree in philosophy, politics, and economics. On his return, Umar joined Rajshahi University in 1963 as the founding chair of the political science department, later co-founding the sociology department, at the remarkably young age of 32. His decisively interdisciplinary formation — encompassing such fields of study as philosophy, political science, sociology, and economics — endowed him with a breadth of vision that would variously inform and inflect, and even shape, his subsequent theoretical interventions.Umar began making those interventions in the mid-1960s — a heady historical conjuncture across Asia and Africa, marked by national liberation struggles, anti-colonial movements, and the insurrectionary pulse of Marxism. It was within this politically charged milieu that Umar emerged as a radical, ‘oppositional’ intellectual — exactly in the sense later articulated by the Palestinian public intellectual and ‘postcolonial’ theorist Edward Said (1935–2003). Umar’s trilogy of works — Sampradayikata (Communalism, 1966), Sangskritir Sankat (Crises of Culture, 1967), and Sangskritik Sampradayikata (Cultural Communalism, 1969) — broke new ground. These works theorise, with superb rigor, the dialectics of mutually imbricated politics and culture, the intersections of colonialism and communalism, and the crises of identity in East Pakistan, among other constellations of concerns. It is here that I must quickly but emphatically underline Umar’s first notable conceptual contribution made via his celebrated trilogy: even without having read the Italian Marxist revolutionary Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937), Umar is able to formulate, in his own terms, the Gramscian contention that culture itself is political, and to mobilise that insight with real, transformative effect. It is characteristic of Umar to interrogate the politics of culture as much as the culture of politics. Yes, Umar continues to teach us that culture has its politics — and politics, its culture. And it is he who, for the first time, introduces and theorises the very concept of political culture in our part of the world — a groundbreaking intervention, powerfully exemplified as it is in his book Bangladesher Rajnoitik Sangskriti (The Political Culture of Bangladesh, 1997).But it is Umar’s trilogy that initially established him as the first serious theorist of communalism and culture in our context and, by extension, as an early theorist of ‘Bengali’ nationalism itself. Although by no means a nationalist himself, Umar — in his trilogy — lays bare the structures, fissures, and fractures of communal politics, while at the same time providing us with a solid conceptual framework to grasp nationalism itself and even morphing it into a weapon of analysis. In doing so, Umar nonetheless helped shape a nationalist consciousness, an insurgent necessity in the era of anti-imperialist and anti-neo-colonial struggles; and, in our specific instance, in our struggles against the historically specific form of Pakistani neocolonial domination and exploitation. In effect, Umar’s interventions cast him as a cultural freedom fighter even prior to 1971 about which Umar has written at least six remarkable books.To be precise, as early as 1968, Umar’s anti-colonial antagonism sharpened into an irrevocable rupture with Pakistan through his confrontation with East Pakistan’s governor Abdul Monem Khan. This very confrontation led to a choice that is rare and exemplary: Umar abandoned an extraordinarily promising academic career in order to dedicate his entire life to political struggle. Here was the astonishing story of an Oxford graduate and university teacher, poised for prestige and recognition, who instead became a full-time revolutionary, committed wholly to the toiling masses — workers and peasants. This transformation itself embodied one of Umar’s deepest convictions: that the meaning of intellectual life does not reside in careers, accolades, appointments, or prizes, but in revolutionary practice. And for Umar, of course, the borderlines between his intellectual life and his political life dissolved decisively, giving rise to a new rhythm of living, knowing, acting, and becoming-and-being in a world characterised by capitalism, imperialism/neocolonialism, racism, and patriarchy — the interconnected systems of oppression that Umar’s work continues to confront, challenge, and combat in a variety of ways. In 1969, then, already armed with Marxist theory and militancy, Umar joined the East Pakistan Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) and edited its weekly organ, Saptahik Ganashakti (Weekly Ganashakti). His editorial leadership itself was a tour de force, traversing issues of theory and history with remarkable acuity. During the Liberation War of 1971, however, Umar opposed his party’s line, producing two historic dissenting documents. He resigned in December 1971 and turned to reconstructing peasants and workers’ movements in Bangladesh, while also nurturing progressive cultural organisations on the left. He served as president of both the Bangladesh Krishak Federation (Bangladesh Peasants Federation) and Bangladesh Lekhak Shibir (the country’s oldest national organisation of writers, artists, and activists on the left) and later of the Jatiya Mukti Council (National Liberation Council). He was also one of the founders — and an active member — of the Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Fascist Committee in Bangladesh. Unusually productive and prolific as he was, while noted for his boundless intellectual energy, Badruddin Umar has authored more than a hundred books and countless articles in both Bangla and English. The scale, scope, and reach of his interests and engagements are simply staggering. And by no means do I claim to offer a comprehensive evaluation of Umar’s wide-ranging work, given particularly the limits or exigencies of space here. However, I intend to tabulate and underline certain high points of his work that I find significant, while conveying at least a sense of the totality of his oeuvre.Across the sheer sweep of his writings — relentlessly spanning over six uncompromising decades — one can still hear the steady beat of Umar’s abiding concerns. He characteristically and tirelessly returns to the question of class, tracing the tangled genealogies of our ruling and middle classes along with those of our peasants and workers. And, of course, he stubbornly deals with the very theory of politics itself, drawing conceptual resources and strategic strength from Marxism-Leninism as a living, dialectical arsenal of analysis and action. He maps what the philosopher John Protevi once called the ‘political physics’ of mass uprisings — peasant revolts, workers’ strikes, national liberation struggles — that shook not only our own land but also what the Argentine-Cuban Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928-1967) once famously called the ‘tri-continent’ (Asia, Africa, and Latin America). Further, in his work, Umar confronts head-on the rise of fundamentalism and the menace of religious fascism, in both India and Bangladesh. Umar also lays bare, with clinical precision, the rot of the lumpen-bourgeois political culture that has long corroded the country from within. For Umar, these were never fleeting fixations; they were the lifeblood of a political activist and intellectual who consecrated his existence to the dream of a democratic and socialist transformation. And — remarkably, for the first time — Badruddin Umar theorises with brutal clarity the historically determinate form of fascism — its specific emergence and burning particularities — in Bangladesh in his 2001 book called Bangladeshe Fascibaad (Fascism in Bangladesh) — a work that even anticipates some of the insights that the Italian left theorist and critic Alberto Toscano brilliantly articulates in his relatively recent book called Late Fascism (2023). For both Umar and Toscano, ‘fascism, like other political phenomena, varies according to its socioeconomic context,’ to use Toscano’s own words. Of course, Umar characteristically historicises and contextualises fascism in Bangladesh. As he put it — trailblazer that he was — as early as 2001: ‘From 1971 onward, the foundations of fascism in the new state were laid by relying on foreign powers such as the Soviet Union, India, and the United States. Whether these states are described as social-imperialist, expansionist, or imperialist, it is upon their support that Awami-Baksali fascism, then the military fascism of Zia and Ershad, and subsequently the fascism of BNP and Awami League’s elected governments, have been established and made effective’ (translation mine). And, of course, Umar — like other ‘third-world’ Marxists such as Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972), Aimé Césaire (1913–2008), and Amílcar Cabral (1924–1973) — links fascism to the macrologics and micrologics of neocolonialism and imperialism, and thus, to capitalist mode of production itself.But Umar — in Bangladeshe Fascibaad (Fascism in Bangladesh) — primarily speaks of fascism in brutal specificities within the Bangladeshi context: ‘At this conjuncture in Bangladesh, a novel version of the Awami-BAKSALi government has assumed power. They cannot be described as merely the political representatives of fascism in the neo-colonial era; rather, their fascism has a specific character — one that idolises Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family as the bearers of certain ideals and principles, which, from the very founding moment of Bangladesh, had been designated as ‘Mujibism.’ Under this banner, they have established a reign of extreme repression and oppression. [...] This fascism must be resisted. But by no means would it be appropriate to understand it merely as the fascism of a single party. [...] This fascism belongs not only to the Awami League itself, but also to the Jatiya Party, the BNP, and Jamaat-e-Islami all at once. Against this newly formed ruling class, divided into different parties but united in essence, there is no alternative to a broad-based, united resistance by the peasants, workers, and all working people of the country — together with students and the entire progressive educated section of the country. Keeping this goal in view, the people of this country must continuously fight against Bangladeshi fascism’ (translation mine). In other words, Badruddin Umar develops a distinct understanding of fascism in Bangladesh, identifying its coordinates and contours most clearly in the Awami League’s politics of chauvinistic Bengali nationalism, monopolisation of Liberation War history, suppression of minorities and dissent, and dependence on India’s fascist-colonialist backing. He argues that while fascism in Europe historically derived its strength from domestic mass bases, the Awami League’s unprecedentedly brutal and murderous authoritarianism in Bangladesh survived largely, if not exclusively, through external support. Umar also saw Jamaat-e-Islami as bearing fascist characteristics because of its historically proven drive to impose religious absolutism, in addition to perpetrating different forms and forces of anti-people violence. Although committed to ‘national liberation’ in language, education, and economy, Umar consistently warned that extreme nationalism tends to degenerate into fascism, making his theoretical framework the earliest and sharpest intervention in the history of the country’s political thought.And, of course, Umar consistently accentuated the need for an anti-fascist mass uprising. It is not for nothing that he was among the founders of the Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Fascist Committee in Bangladesh. Umar, in fact, underscores the need for a permanent struggle against fascism itself. And this was not merely theory: it was an uprising he had long foreseen and, more than two decades later, lived to witness in the July Uprising of 2024 — an uprising he actively supported and hailed as the largest and most remarkable in the political history of Bangladesh. It is worth noting, too, that during this turbulent conjuncture, the very term fascism — consistently used by Umar over the years — gained sharper currency and wider use, culminating in the dismantling of Sheikh Hasina’s fascist government itself. One can surely extend further the catalogue of Umar’s intellectual and political preoccupations. For instance, to his relentless focus on the class question in our part of the world — and on the historical formation of Bangladesh’s ruling classes, along with other classes like workers and peasants — one must add his sustained critical interrogations of the political economy and culture of capitalism in both global and local contexts; his probing inquiries into the dilemmas and prospects of socialist movements across the world, and into the crises and possibilities of reconstructing the communist movement in Bangladesh. One should also add Umar’s analysis of the pervasive phenomena of militarism and military dictatorship in the Third World; his critically interventionist exposure of the entanglements of politics, business, and the law in a wider regime of criminalisation; and his investigations into the politics of education, knowledge, and pedagogy. Equally significant are Umar’s reflections on the role of the middle-class, including its intellectuals and writers. And then one must underline his steadfast attention to the struggles of religious, ethnic, and linguistic minorities in Bangladesh and beyond; his insistence on ascribing centrality to the ‘woman question’ in our discursive and political practices as such; and even his subsequent sustained engagement with ecology and environment. In fact, as the years rolled on, Umar turned with ever sharper focus to what I would call a critical trinity of urgent questions — the woman question, the minority question, and the environmental or ecological question — each of which, though relatively ignored and sometimes even elided in his earlier work, came to occupy a remarkably more significant place in his later interventions.

Several groups, including the Independent Ebtedayee Madrasah Teachers’ Union, the teachers of schools for students with disabilities, and the United Non-MPO Unity Council began separate sit-in demonstrations near the press club in the morning. Traffic congestion began in the area at about 2:30pm when several thousand teachers, under the platform of the Independent Ebtedayee Madrassah Teachers’ Union, brought out a march towards the chief adviser’s residence Jamuna, and were intercepted by the police at Kadam Foara, after marching a few yards. Sunday was the 21st day of the continuous sit-in programme of the ebtedayee madrassah teachers in the National Press Club area. After facing the police barricade, the protesting madrassah teachers sat down, which ultimately blocked one side of the road. They have been demanding the immediate implementation of the government’s January 28 announcement that all approved independent ebtedayee madrasahs would be nationalised. Due to the blockade, traffic movement became standstill on both ends of the blockade point. As time passed, traffic congestion spread to the nearby areas, which affected several other areas, including Matshyabhaba, Shahbagh, Banglamotor, Paltan, Bijoy Sarani, Naya Paltan, Mouchak, Gulistan, and some other parts of Old Dhaka. The platform’s chairman, Mokhlesur Rahman, said that they withdrew their blockade from the road at about 6:00pm after a fruitful meeting with the education ministry officials. He, however, said that they would continue their movement until their demand was met. Meanwhile, several thousand teachers under the United Non-MPO Unity Council also staged a sit-in in front of the Press Club, demanding that the government bring all approved non-MPO educational institutions under MPO facilities. They also brought out a procession in the afternoon. The procession paraded nearby roads. Teachers and staff members of schools for disabled students, on the other hand, held a march towards the Bangladesh Secretariat in the afternoon, demanding recognition of their institutions and declaration of monthly pay order for them. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s deputy commissioner for media and public relations, Talebur Rahman, in a press release, said that simultaneous street protests by several groups disrupted traffic at different places in the capital. ‘These (the street protests) have disrupted traffic on several important roads, causing widespread public suffering and severe traffic congestion in some parts of the capital,’ he said.

Although the matter was initially resolved, at about 8:30pm on Monday night a group of marketing students assaulted a statistics student in Chawk Bazar area just outside the university campus, triggering unrest on the campus. After 9:00pm, a group of students of the statistics and physics departments started chanting slogans on the campus. A group of students of the marketing department forcibly entered the sociology department and vandalised the facilities. Later they got into a clash with the statistics and physics departments’ students, leaving at least four injured. In the light of the seriousness of the situation, the university disciplinary committee convened an emergency meeting at about 3:30am on Tuesday, resulting in the suspension of the students involved. Vice-chancellor Showkat Ali said, ‘We’ve formed a five-member investigation committee to investigate the incident further.’ The committee is headed by student counselling and guidance office director Ilyas Pramanik, with proctor Ferdous Rahman serving as its member secretary, he said. Further punitive measures will be taken against those involved in the incident after receiving the probe committee’s report, the VC added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/279086/8-brur-students-suspended-over-clash", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 308},

The financial crime unit of the CID filed the case with Bagerhat sadar police station on Wednesday, said a press release signed by CID special superintendent of police (media) Jasim Uddin Khan on Thursday. Three other accused in the case are Anisur Rahman, Saleha Begum and Mannan’s wife Jasmine Nahar. Preliminary investigation into the money laundering found that the accused were involved in transferring the deposits of Tk 245,23,33,000 from 19,967 general investors by promising high profits for a company named New Bashundhara Real Estate Limited. Investigators found that Mannan served as a staff member in the Bagerhat DC office from 1984 to 2010 and was involved in buying and selling land during his government service. His employment at the DC office led to his connection with people at various levels of the administration. After retirement, Mannan founded a real estate company, New Bashundhara Real Estate, where he and his family own 95 per cent share while Anisur owns 5 per cent share. The company lured investors by offering high profits for investing in the company and collected the laundered amount till June 2018. From the investors’ money, Mannan invested Tk 66,02,67,000 in his six affiliated companies, namely Ajax Jute Mills Limited in Khulna, Sabil Dredging and Engineering Limited, Sabil Law Plaza, Sabil Fisheries Project, Sabil Agricultural Development Project in Bagerhat and Sabil General Hospital in Pirojpur, according to the CID investigation.

{"title": "Unsafe food, broken laws", "body": "EVERY year on October 16, the world observes World Food Day. This year’s theme, ‘hand in hand for better food and a better future,’ calls for collective effort towards a healthier and more sustainable world. The day holds particular significance this year, as it coincides with the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Food and Agriculture Organisation in 2025. Across the globe, and in Bangladesh, the occasion is marked with events to raise awareness about hunger, malnutrition, sustainable food systems and global food security. Food is one of the basic human needs, yet mere consumption is not enough to ensure safety and nutrition. Since food has a direct connection to human health, productivity and quality of life, access to safe and nutritious food must be recognised not merely as a necessity but as a legal right. Safe food is a fundamental human right, and the survival and wellbeing of humankind depend upon it. Article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights upholds this right, and Articles 15(a) and 18(1) of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh affirm the state’s obligation to ensure that all citizens have access to adequate food. Bangladesh enacted the Safe Food Act in 2013 to guarantee this right. To enforce it, the Bangladesh Safe Food Authority was established on 2 February 2015. The authority’s primary responsibility is to ensure the right to safe food through proper regulation of production, import, processing, distribution, marketing and sales. It has since framed several rules and regulations to operationalise its mandate. However, the pressing question remains, how safe and healthy is the food we consume? The excessive and uncontrolled use of chemicals and pesticides in agriculture poses a serious threat to food safety. These substances, applied to boost yields, eventually enter the human body and cause long-term health complications. Fruits, milk and fish are often contaminated with artificial colours, sweeteners and other adulterants, endangering public health. Food is also frequently stored at improper temperatures and transported in unhygienic conditions, compounding the problem. A lack of awareness among producers, traders and consumers aggravates the situation. Many farmers are unaware of the proper withdrawal periods for pesticides, while unscrupulous sellers prioritise profit over safety. In urban areas, weak food preservation practices, poor transportation systems, water pollution and inadequate waste management make food insecurity even more severe. Open market practices, where meat, fish, milk and vegetables are exposed to the environment without proper hygiene, increase the risk of contamination. Corruption within the administration and poor enforcement of food safety laws further perpetuate the problem. The Safe Food Act and related quality control regulations are not effectively implemented. A lack of adequate monitoring and the absence of regular mobile courts allow offenders to escape meaningful punishment. Moreover, Bangladesh does not yet have modern laboratories to conduct comprehensive food testing, making it difficult to identify adulteration accurately. The Safe Food Act 2013, the Consumer Rights Protection Act 2009, the Adulteration Act, and the establishment of the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority have together created a strong legal framework. Yet the major challenge remains enforcement. Due to corruption and administrative inefficiency, offenders are rarely punished, or if they are, the penalties are insufficient to deter future violations. In contrast, India imposes life imprisonment for food adulteration, while in China the offence is punishable by death. Bangladesh too prescribes the death penalty or life imprisonment for similar crimes, yet the laws are seldom applied. Mobile courts occasionally fine offenders, but they often resume their activities soon afterwards. To protect citizens’ right to safe food, legal cases should be resolved swiftly, within a month and bail should not be granted to repeat offenders. Safe and nutritious food is not merely a domestic issue but a global concern. Internationally, several legal frameworks and standards such as the Codex Alimentarius, ISO 22000, the EU Food Law (Regulation 178/2002) and the Global Food Safety Initiative have been developed to ensure consumer protection and fairness in food trade. These frameworks aim to safeguard public health and promote uniform standards for food production and processing worldwide. Every country, including Bangladesh, must align its systems with these global benchmarks. Bangladesh is already a signatory to multiple international treaties and standards, including the World Trade Organisation’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, Codex Alimentarius and ISO 22000, particularly concerning food exports and consumer safety. As a member of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, Bangladesh follows the quality standards set by the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution and the Bangladesh Safe Food Authority, both of which base their guidelines on Codex principles. The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock and the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority are jointly responsible for ensuring food security and mitigating health risks. Many export-oriented industries, particularly those involved in food processing, are certified under the ISO 22000 Food Safety Management System and implement the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point standards, especially for fish, meat and processed food exports. Compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point and SPS is mandatory for shrimp and fish exports to the European Union and the United States. The National Food Safety Policy has also been formulated and mobile courts have been deployed alongside the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection to combat food adulteration. To strengthen these efforts, the government must enhance market surveillance and conduct regular inspections to ensure proper enforcement of laws. Offenders involved in adulteration must face strict punishment and public awareness campaigns should encourage consumers to make informed choices about food quality. The establishment of modern laboratories and mobile testing units is essential to detect contamination efficiently. Above all, administrative bodies must be freed from corruption to restore integrity in food governance. If laws are properly enforced, we can ensure food that is safe, wholesome and pure. The enactment of new, comprehensive measures will be necessary to guarantee food security, public health and national wellbeing. A healthy and prosperous future for Bangladesh depends on ensuring that every citizen has access to clean, safe and nutritious food and water.

{"title": "N Korea warns of ‘offensive action’ after missile test", "body": "North Korea’s defence minister warned Saturday of more ‘offensive action’, as Washington and Seoul criticised Pyongyang’s latest ballistic missile launch. North Korea’s missile launch on Friday came just over a week after US president Donald Trump—on a tour of the region—expressed interest in meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang did not respond to the offer. Pyongyang’s defence minister No Kwang Chol said Washington ‘has become brazen in its military moves to threaten the security’ of the North, and that it was ‘intentionally escalating the political and military tension in the region’. ‘We will show more offensive action against the enemies’ threat,’ he said, according to Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency. Earlier in the week, before Friday’s launch, US Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and his South Korean counterpart visited the Demilitarised Zone where they ‘reaffirmed the strong combined defence posture and close cooperation’ between their countries. On Wednesday, the US nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington arrived in the South Korean port city of Busan for logistics support and crew rest, according to Seoul’s navy—an act North Korea’s No said was ‘further escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula’. No also said Hegseth’s DMZ visit was meant to ‘fan up war hysterics’. The US Indo-Pacific Command said Friday that North Korea’s latest ballistic missile launch ‘highlights the destabilising impact’ of Pyongyang’s actions, adding that the United States was ‘consulting closely with our allies and partners’. South Korea’s military had strongly condemned Pyongyang’s missile launch. Seoul’s military ‘urges North Korea to immediately cease all actions that heighten tensions between the two Koreas’, it said in a statement. Trump last week also announced that he had approved South Korea’s plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine. Developing such a submarine would mark a significant leap in South Korea’s naval and defence industrial base, analysts say, joining a select group of countries with such vessels. They have said Seoul’s plan to construct an atomic-driven vessel would likely draw an aggressive response from Pyongyang. South Korean lawmakers, briefed by the defence intelligence agency, said earlier this week that Pyongyang appears ready to promptly carry out what would be its seventh nuclear test, should leader Kim decide to proceed.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/281559/n-korea-warns-of-offensive-action-after-missile-test", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 365},
{"title": "Northern farmers unhappy with low aman paddy prices", "body": "With the harvesting going on in full swing, farmers across the northern region are unhappy as Aman paddy prices have fallen this season despite higher production costs and widespread yield losses triggered by early-November rainfall. Growers in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions said that heavy rainfall in the first week of November waterlogged many fields, sending paddy under water in many places and reducing yields—a setback that comes amid a sharp rise in input costs compared with last year. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, the two-day rain spell earlier this month damaged crops on 19,568 hectares of farmland in Rajshahi, Naogaon, Natore and Chapainawabganj districts, causing an estimated loss of Tk 131.31 crore. The DAE data shows that crops on 1,649 hectares were completely destroyed, while on another 13,860 hectares were partially affected. Aman paddy suffered the worst blow, with plants on 585 hectares fully destroyed and that on 12,501 hectares partially damaged. Farmers said that they had expected high prices because of reduced output, but early market oversupply and traders’ syndicates had left no way for them but sell the crops at low prices. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, aman paddy has been cultivated on 4.10 lakh hectres of land in four districts, Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Chapainawabganj in the current season. Till Thursday, about 29 per cent paddy was harvested. On Saturday, coarse paddy, which is the most widely cultivated variety, sold for Tk 950–1,050 (wet) and Tk 1,000–1,200 (dry) per maund in local markets, while fine katarivog paddy fetched Tk 1,400–1,600. Farmers said that they got Tk 200–250 more per maund last year. Production costs, they added, increased for fertiliser, pesticides, irrigation, transport and labour, worsening their financial strain. Sohag Islam, a farmer from Durgapur upazila, described the situation as a ‘double blow’. ‘The yield is lower and the price is also low. Our expenses keep rising, but selling paddy does not even cover production costs. Repaying debts is becoming very difficult,’ he said. Nur Mohammad, an award-winning farmer from Tanore, said that small and marginal growers were being hit the hardest. ‘Businessmen are stocking up paddy. They aren’t paying the actual price. As small and marginal growers took loans for cultivation, they must sell the crops to repay their loans. Businessmen are utilising that opportunity,’ he said. He added that the government’s decision to reduce its procurement price—from Tk 36 to Tk 34 per kilogram—had intensified farmers’ worries. ‘Government centres also require strict moisture levels. Farmers bring freshly harvested paddy and cannot meet those conditions. So they can neither sell to the government nor get a good price in the open market,’ he said. Shahana Akhter Jahan, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Marketing, Rajshahi division, told New Age that rain-related losses had reduced yields in several pockets, but prices typically fluctuated when early harvests reached markets. She said that farmers might be able to get a good price if they could store the crop for a little longer. Farmers, however, fear that if prices do not improve soon, many will slip deeper into debt and face difficulties preparing land for the upcoming robi season.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/282979/northern-farmers-unhappy-with-low-aman-paddy-prices", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 523},
{"title": "REHAB housing fair begins Wednesday", "body": "Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh is set to host the four-day 27th edition of its flagship housing exhibition, ‘REHAB Fair 2025’, starting on December 24. ‘Through organising such fairs, REHAB continues its efforts to expand the housing market both domestically and internationally,’ REHAB president Wahiduzzaman said at the press conference on Monday at CIRDAP auditorium in the capital to share details about the fair. The fair will run until December 27 at the China Friendship Conference Centre in Agargaon, featuring 220 stalls from organisations in the housing, construction materials, and related sectors under one roof. REHAB said that the inaugural session of the fair will be held at 11 am at the Hall of Fame auditorium of CFCC on Wednesday, where RAJUK chairman Md Riazul Islam will attend as chief guest and National Housing Authority chairman Ferdousi Begum will attend as special guest. Wahiduzzaman said the housing sector plays a vital role in the economy by generating revenue, creating employment, supporting over 200 related industries, and sustaining the livelihoods of around 5 million people. However, he added that the sector had suffered for years due to complex and inconsistent provisions in the old Detailed Area Plan, which stalled approvals for new projects and forced many developers to scale down their operations. He further said the recently gazette amended DAP and Dhaka Metropolitan Building Construction Rules have removed most of the earlier complications and disparities, creating renewed confidence in the sector. He expressed hope that a large crowd would gather at the fair, as it is a three-day holiday. According to him, the fair aims to simplify access to housing information while fostering transparency between buyers and developers. Senior vice-president Liaquat Ali Bhuiyan, vice-president Lion MA Awal, vice-president (finance) Abdur Razzak, fair committee chairman Mohammad Akhter Biswas, fair committee co-chairman Suruj Sardar, director Sheikh Kamal, among others, attended the conference. The fair remains open from 10:00am to 9:00pm. The organiser said visitors can buy single-entry tickets at Tk 50, while multiple-entry tickets at Tk 100, allowing up to five entries in a day. They said that earnings from ticket sales will be used to support underprivileged communities under the association’s corporate social responsibility programme, continuing its efforts to combine industry growth with social responsibility. There will be attractive prizes through raffle draws every day. Since launching its first housing fair in Dhaka in 2001, REHAB has also organised 16 fairs in Chattogram, reflecting growing demand outside the capital. REHAB’s outreach has extended outside Bangladesh as well. To date, the association has organised 12 housing fairs in the United States, along with two in the United Arab Emirates and one each in Italy, Canada, Australia and Qatar, targeting expatriate Bangladeshis interested in investing in property back home. This year’s Rehab Fair will feature four Diamond Sponsors, seven Gold Sponsors, 10 Co-Sponsors, 14 Building Materials Companies and 12 Financial Institutions.

{"title": "Unchecked mining waste taints DR Congo communities", "body": "Carrying her sore-pocked daughter across her decaying field, Helene Mvubu says she is one of thousands to have fallen victim to the toxic waste defiling the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mining capital. Global powers, notably China and the United States, are in a race to extract strategic minerals in the DRC, which supplies more than 70 per cent of the world’s cobalt, essential for making electric batteries and weaponry. But human rights groups say the mining operations are resulting in severe environmental damage in the mineral-rich African nation. Mvubu told AFP that she has for years suffered the consequences of flooding from contaminated water discharged by Congo Dongfang International Mining, a Chinese company that processes copper and cobalt ore in the outskirts of Lubumbashi, capital of the mineral-rich Katanga province in the southeastern DRC. ‘The food we prepare becomes bitter, our water sources are polluted,’ said the farmer as she walked across her plot, where the sugarcane has turned yellow with disease. Mvubu’s field is located directly within the path of runoff water from the CDM site, surrounded by an imposing concrete wall guarded by officers, on a mountain overlooking residential neighbourhoods. The extent of the pollution is unknown. But when it rains, red water can be seen gushing out from four drainage points under the enclosure. Residents and civil society groups interviewed by AFP accused CDM of taking advantage of rainy periods to discharge mining wastewater. At the beginning of November, thousands of cubic metres of the reddish water poured out from the Chinese company site over two days, despite no rainfall. Outrage over the flooding forced Congolese authorities to act by suspending the site’s activities and appointing an investigative commission—a rare move in a country where mining companies generally operate with impunity, often with the complicity of local administrations. ‘Everyone was surprised to see the waters flooding us even though it hadn’t rained,’ said resident Hortance Kiluba, as she busied herself washing her laundry. Joseph Kongolo, a member of the investigative commission and provincial coordinator of the National Human Rights Commission, said the Chinese company ‘was misled by the weather and opened the valves before the rains fell’ that would have otherwise hidden the flow. CDM, however, claimed that the November flood was caused by the accidental rupture of a retention basin. Several members of the investigative commission charge that pollution from the site dates back several years. But no study on the toxicity of the wastewater has yet been made public. Residents told AFP they have experienced harmful effects first-hand. Martiny, a vendor of fruits and vegetables at the local market, showed her ‘damaged’ hands and feet that she blamed on the exposure to ‘acidic’ water. The November flood, which inundated the market, also soaked her supply of dried fish, leaving it inedible. To calm the upset, CDM employees distributed masks and bottles of water to the community. The firm has also led the repairs of a stretch of road damaged by the waters. ‘It’s just for show,’ said a local chief, under the condition of anonymity, claiming that the firm also bribed officials to convince the public that the release of wastewater was accidental and not planned. A CDM representative denied any negligence on the company’s part when contacted by AFP, asserting that ‘the materials are processed on site’ and that ‘there could not have been any prior pollution’ before November. A subsidiary of Chinese multinational Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, CDM has long been in the crosshairs of human rights organisations. Hubert Tshiswaka, director general of the DRC’s Institute for Human Rights Research and member of the investigating commission, has for years fought to get CDM to comply with social and financial obligations—such as the payment of mining royalties—required by law. ‘Curiously, CDM obtained all the permits to set up on top of this hill,’ where rains naturally flow down to the neighbourhoods below, he said. Although the spill pointed to CDM’s ‘disregard for basic standards’ with ‘serious repercussions on the environment’, mining minister Louis Watum Kabamba admitted following the investigation that ‘responsibilities are shared’. ‘Our administration should have played its role,’ he said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/284263/unchecked-mining-waste-taints-dr-congo-communities", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 687},
{"title": "One lakh troops, 1.5 lakh police to be deployed", "body": "Around one lakh army personnel and 1.5 lakh members of the police will be deployed across Bangladesh to maintain security and order during the upcoming national election, expected to be held in the first half of February next year. Election Commission senior secretary Akhtar Ahmed said this on Monday, after a meeting chaired by chief election commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin at the EC headquarters in the capital’s Agargaon area. Senior EC officials and representatives from major law enforcement and defence agencies attended the meeting. The EC secretary said that the deployment plan, coordination, and specific roles of the forces were discussed at the meeting. The EC secretary said that the initial plan was to deploy security forces for five days, but a proposal was made to extend the period to eight days - three days before the election, the election day, and four days after the election. ‘This proposal is currently under examination,’ he said. The inspector general of police informed the meeting that about 1.5 lakh police personnel would be engaged in election duties. The Ansar and Village Defence Party would form the largest contingent, with 5.5 lakh to 6 lakh members expected to be deployed, Akhtar said. He said that the Armed Forces, mainly comprising army personnel, were expected to number between 90,000 and one lakh. He said that these are preliminary figures that may be adjusted after categorisation and final distribution. A key issue discussed in the meeting was the role of the Armed Forces, particularly under the ‘In Aid to Civil Power’ framework, with the meeting generally supporting the continuation of the existing arrangement. He said that the final decision on their legal status, whether to maintain the current framework or designate them as part of the law enforcement structure, would depend on revisions to the Representation of the People Order to ensure compliance with electoral laws. He said that the Armed Forces would also provide logistical support, including transporting election materials via Army and Air Force helicopters. To facilitate this, they have requested that helipads be prepared in designated areas for landing and take-off operations, the EC secretary said. Akhtar said that emphasis was placed on strengthening coordination and intelligence sharing among agencies to enhance security. He said that the command structure would be clearly defined to determine who was authorised to communicate officially and that it would be adapted to suit regional environments, noting that coastal areas would require different arrangements from those in the plains or bordering zones. Several technology-based security measures were also discussed in the meeting. These include the use of body-worn cameras for police officers and drones by law enforcement agencies for surveillance, he said. He also said that the meeting explored the use of artificial intelligence and IT systems to curb misinformation on social media, drawing on a model that had been successfully implemented by the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre during the recent Puja season, which had covered over 35,000 sites.

Besides, the authorities had also expelled another student permanently and two others for one year on charges of extorting money from a teacher. The decisions were approved at the 544th syndicate meeting held on Tuesday, with vice-chancellor Professor Saleh Hasan Naqib in the chair, said a press release issued on Wednesday night. According to the release, associate professor Aneek Krishna Karmakar of the applied chemistry and chemical engineering department has been suspended for three years and barred from all examination-related duties for 10 years. The syndicate also suspended Professor Provash Kumar Karmokar of the statistics department and associate professor Mohammad Hedayet Ullah of the finance department. Both will remain suspended until the university’s final termination committee, formed under the RU ordinance, submits its recommendations, officials said. Meanwhile, the syndicate took action against five students in separate investigations – cancelling the studentship of two, permanently expelling one, and suspending two others for one year. Professor Akhtar Hossain Mojumdar, administrator of RU’s public relations office, said that the teachers were punished based on recommendations of inquiry committees formed over separate allegations. He added that the identities of the students were being withheld, as one of them is a female student. University officials said that associate Professor Aneek Krishna Karmakar was earlier accused of lacking required qualifications for recruitment, intimidating students and other irregularities, which triggered student protests in October. Professor Provash Kumar Karmokar faced allegations of sexually harassing a female student in his private office room in early August. The student’s mother later filed a written complaint with the department chair, prompting protests by students demanding his permanent expulsion. On May 11, associate Professor Hedayet Ullah was reportedly found with a female student in a compromising situation inside a campus room. According to the officials, two of the students whose studentship was cancelled – a journalism department student and a law student – were accused of extorting money in connection with the May 11 incident involving Hedayet Ullah. The third is the female student found inside the teacher’s office, who has been permanently expelled for ‘immoral activities’, officials said. The academic certificates of the trio will be cancelled, they added. Two other students have been expelled for one year on the same charge of exploiting the Hedayet Ullah issue.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/284127/rajshahi-university-suspends-three-teachers-cancels-two-studentships", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 399},

Devotees thronged puja mandaps on the last day of the festival, Bijoya Dashami, offering flowers to the goddess Durga and seeking her blessings. Puja mandaps across the country were placed with beautiful idols, showcasing the goddess in all her glory. Bijoya Dashami is a special ceremony of reaffirming peace and good relations among people. On the day, families visit each other to share sweetmeats. Married Hindu women put vermilion on each other’s foreheads on the occasion. Around 33,355 puja mandaps across the country, including the capital, celebrated the religious festival this year. In the capital, thousands of people thronged the Buriganga River to perform the festival’s final ritual—the immersion of the idol of goddess Durga. Devotees with tearful eyes bid farewell to the mother deity and her children–Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik and Ganesh—through the immersion of their idols in the water, wishing for Durga’s return next year. Meanwhile, strict security measures were in place so that Durga Puja ended peacefully. The five-day festival began on September 28 with the incarnation of the goddess Durga, marking Sashthi.

{"title": "Import of 1 lakh tonnes of rice from UAE, Myanmar approved", "body": "The advisory council committee on government purchase in a meeting on Wednesday approved two separate proposals to import of around 100,000 lakh tonnes of rice at around Tk 721.49 crore. The meeting presided over by finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed from the Uninted States on an online platform also approved three separate proposals linked to import of 1.05 crore tonnes of fertilizer by Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation and Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation. One of the two rice purchase deals-- 50,000 tonnes of non-boiled rice-- will be supplied by Myanmar Rice Federation at a cost of Tk 229.32 crore with per tonne costing $376 under a government- to-government deal with the Director Gneberal of Food under the ministry of food. Another 50,000 tonnes of rice, this one non-basmati, will be supplied by M/S Credent One FZCO of the United Arab Emirates which won an open tender of the DG Food quoting Tk 216.90 crore. Each tonne of parboiled rice will cost $355.99. For the current financial year of 2025-26, the government has planned to import 900,000 tonnes of rice to help stabilize domestic prices. On October 7, the advisory council committee on government purchase decided to import of 50,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice from India. Indian supplier Bagadiya Brothers Private Ltd won the supply bid quoting Tk 219.09 crore with the price of per tonne of rice fixed at $359.77. The policymakers said rice import is partly aimed at building reserves so that domestic procurement or production does not fall short. Having a government buffer stock is always better, as private stocks alone may not stabilise the market, they said. The Economic Update and Outlook, released by the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission on Tuesday, said that inflation edged up slightly to 8.36 per cent in September despite a fall in rice prices in August. The prices of rice which are largely blamed for high food inflation in country fell by one percentage points in September from August. The fall has been attributed by the GED to the government recent approvals for importing rice and 2,20,000 tonnes of wheat from the US. The government is also processing to give import order for 4,00,000 tonnes of rice in the next month. The advisory council committee on government purchase also approved three separate proposals linked to import of 1.05 crore tonnes of fertilizer by Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation and Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation. BCIC will import 30,000 tonnes of urea from Saudi Arabia at Tk 151 .7 crore with per tonne costing $413 under the government-to-government negotiation.

{"title": "Govt must end fire safety negligence in factories", "body": "THE apparel sector, considered the backbone of the economy and the livelihood of millions, continues to be haunted by recurring deadly fires. Despite years of promises and countless disasters, hundreds of unlicensed factories continue to run outside any oversight purview, exposing workers to conditions that can only be described as criminally negligent. The recent fire in Anwar Fashion at Mirpur, which left at least 16 dead, is yet another grim reminder that safety remains absent for too many. The Fire Service and Civil Defence recorded 234 fires in apparel factories in 2024. The Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments received reports of safety issues at 143 factories in 2023. The Centre for Policy Dialogue reported that at least 856 factories remain outside the purview of any authority. After the Anwar Fashion fire, it came to light that the factory had no fire exits, alarms or safety systems nor was it registered with any trade bodies and the chemical warehouse that ignited the inferno was already on the fire service’s list of illegal establishments. It is evident that the government’s approach to worker safety is weak, fragmented and reactive. The Anwar Fashion fire has proved once again that worker safety mechanisms are inadequate. After the fire at Tazreen Fashions and the collapse of Rana Plaza, which left more than a thousand workers dead, a number of international and national initiatives were taken to ensure worker safety, but the apparel units that are not members of major trade bodies remain ungoverned. Non-apparel units are also excluded from the oversight mechanism. The Labour Force Survey 2024 of the Bureau of Statistics shows that 58 million out of 69 million workers are in informal jobs, highlighting the state’s limited reach in protecting the work force. The government and trade bodies have for too long prioritised export-orientated compliance for the benefits of international buyers while turning a blind eye to the unregistered factories that sustain a shadow economy of cheap labour. Every time a fire breaks out, officials rush to issue statements and promise investigations while enforcement mechanisms remain riddled with corruption, overlapping jurisdictions and human resource shortage. In what follows, labour leaders are not wrong when they say that worker deaths by fires are not accidents but acts of negligent homicide. To break this cycle, the government needs more than occasional factory inspection and probe bodies after industrial fires. It requires a national industrial safety policy that unifies all enforcement agencies under a single command structure with shared data and accountability. Trade bodies must expand their purview to include small and subcontracted factories while international retailers must take responsibility for every link in their supply chains. Bangladesh cannot claim progress while its workers continue to die in preventable fires.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/279375/govt-must-end-fire-safety-negligence-in-factories", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 456},

{"title": "Gunman kills four in attack on Michigan church", "body": "A man opened fire in a Mormon church in Michigan and set the building ablaze on Sunday, killing at least four people in the latest deadly tragedy that US president Donald Trump called part of a national ‘epidemic of violence.’ Police in the northern US state said the shooter first rammed the church with his vehicle before opening fire with an assault rifle, and then set the building on fire. The attacker was killed by police in the parking lot eight minutes after the first emergency call came in, Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye told a news conference. Renye said that, in addition to two deceased victims announced earlier in the day, two more bodies had been recovered among debris at the burned-down church, with search efforts on-going. He said earlier that eight people had also been wounded in the attack, one of whom was in critical condition. AFP journalists in the adjacent town of Burton saw a large police presence outside the home of the suspected shooter, whom Renye identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, aged 40. Renye and other officials did not provide any further details on Sanford. US media reports said he had grown up in the area and was a military veteran. Images of the aftermath at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, a suburb of the city of Flint, showed most of the building reduced to ashes. Authorities said the suspect used an accelerant, believed to be gasoline, and set fire to the church ‘deliberately.’ Some suspected explosive devices were found but it was unclear if they were used to start the fire, they said. Photos also showed the truck apparently driven by the attacker into the side of the building, with two US flags on poles in the vehicle’s rear. FBI Special Agent Reuben Coleman told the news conference that the FBI was now leading the investigation and was looking at the attack ‘as an act of targeted violence.’ Renye said earlier that hundreds were inside when the attack began and that more victims might be found among the debris. Trump called the shooting ‘horrendous’ and said it was ‘yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America.’ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints called Sunday’s attack a ‘tragic act of violence.’ ‘Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved,’ it wrote on social media platform X. Founded in 1830, the Mormon church considers itself a Christian body but bases its doctrines on the Book of Mormon, a text its followers say contains a fuller version of the words of Jesus Christ than that recorded in the Bible. Based in the western US state of Utah, there are Mormon churches all over the world, with millions of adherents. The United States, where firearms are readily available, has a long history of gun violence. But tensions have soared in recent weeks after a series of high-profile attacks, including the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah and a deadly shooting at a federal immigration enforcement facility in Texas. Sunday’s attack also comes a month after a mass shooting at a Catholic church and school in Minnesota, in which two children were killed while attending Mass, and several others were severely wounded. Political divisions have grown deeper in the wake of the attacks, with Trump launching a campaign targeting left-wing groups he accuses of being ‘domestic terrorists.’ Trump wrote in his Truth Social post Sunday: ‘THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!’ The head of the Mormon church, Russell Nelson, died on Saturday at age 101 in Utah, the church earlier announced. Trump in a separate post said Nelson — who worked as a heart surgeon before taking on church leadership roles — was ‘a physician, literally and spiritually, and will be greatly missed!’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/277533/gunman-kills-four-in-attack-on-michigan-church", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 656},
{"title": "No industrial profits at cost of worker rights", "body": "THE latest findings of Amnesty International present an alarming picture of the global apparel supply chain, outlining how governments, factory owners and major fashion brands continue to profit from the systematic repression of workers across Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In two companion reports, Amnesty asserts that widespread anti-union practice and deliberate suppression of labour rights remain embedded in the region’s export-driven apparel sector. Together, the studies contend that global brands sustain their profits by relying on a largely underpaid and overwhelmingly female workforce, where retaliation, management-controlled committees and intimidation prevent genuine unionisation. Although the reports draw on research from September 2023–August 2024, including 88 interviews across 20 factories, their central concern is the persistence of structural barriers that silence workers despite a decade of global pledges after the Rana Plaza disaster. Amnesty’s assessment is stark, the industry’s core business model incentivises union suppression and entrenches exploitation while corporate social responsibility frameworks and sustainability codes do little to change the daily realities of workers. Bangladeshi suppliers, however, have strongly challenged the accuracy of the findings, arguing that the data are flawed, unrepresentative and unfairly critical. At the core of Amnesty’s findings lies a structural contradiction that political economists have for long identified. When profit accumulation depends on suppressing labour costs, any meaningful expression of worker agency becomes a threat rather than a democratic right. The persistence of anti-union practices across South Asia reflects this logic. In a region where garments anchor export revenues and foreign exchange stability, governments and factory owners have strong incentives to maintain wage competitiveness, even when doing so erodes the rights that make industrial work sustainable. This dynamic is further entrenched by global brands whose purchasing practices externalise the burden of cost management onto factories, which in turn displace the pressure onto workers. The result is a system where women, who make up the bulk of the work force, carry the heaviest weight of exploitation under the guise of economic necessity. The implications are profound. Weakened unions compromise safety oversight, limit bargaining power and ultimately depress long-term productivity by normalising high turnover and burnout. A credible path forward therefore requires acknowledging that labour rights are not an optional moral add-on but an economic stabiliser. Aligning brand purchasing commitments with living wage benchmarks, strengthening regional regulatory convergence and guaranteeing freedom of association would move the sector from perpetual crisis management towards a right-centred industrial future. The government, factory owners and global brands should act decisively to respect labour rights, ensure living wages and support genuine unionisation. Only through coordinated regional frameworks, transparent supply chains and enforceable commitments can the industry reconcile profitability with justice, safeguarding both workers and the long-term credibility of the apparel economy.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/283524/no-industrial-profits-at-cost-of-worker-rights", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 449},

The plan includes both online and offline initiatives to raise consumer awareness. The association made the announcement during a press conference titled ‘CAB’s Activity Briefing’ held at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the capital. At the event, CAB president AHM Shafiquzzaman alleged that although the Bangladesh Bank had introduced low-interest loan schemes for farmers, only a very small number of them are benefiting from it. He said that farmers were being forced to borrow money at high interest rates due to the influence of syndicates. ‘This year, Tk 30,000 crore has been allocated as low-interest loans for farmers. But whether marginal farmers are actually receiving the benefit remains a big question. Large syndicates have emerged around this loan, forcing farmers to borrow at high interest,’ he said. He asserted that CAB would work more actively in the coming days to break such syndicates and ensure fair benefits for farmers. Clarifying CAB’s mandate, Shafiquzzaman said, ‘It is not CAB’s responsibility to enforce the law. CAB identifies irregularities and advises relevant authorities, makes policy recommendations, and when necessary, files writ petitions with the High Court in matters of public interest.’ Authorities like the National Consumer Rights Protection, BSTI, Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, district commissioners and UNOs exercise administrative powers.

{"title": "Mogadishu holds first local vote in decades", "body": "Somalians turned out in droves on Thursday to vote in local elections in the capital Mogadishu—the first by universal suffrage in nearly 60 years—with the city locked down amid security concerns. The east African country is struggling to emerge from decades of conflict and chaos, battling a bloody Islamist insurgency and frequent natural disasters. Long lines snaked outside seven polling stations that an AFP correspondent in the capital visited early on Thursday, with those waiting impatient and excited to cast their ballots. ‘This is a great day,’ Guhad Ali, 37, said, proudly showing his ink-stained finger, proof that he had voted. ‘I am so proud that I don’t even feel that I’m queuing,’ said 29-year-old mother of two Shamso Ahmed, who spent hours waiting to cast a ballot for the first time in her life. Thursday’s polls will serve as a test of the direct voting system championed by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, amid opposition from the country’s states who say it is a bid to centralise power in Mogadishu. ‘This is the future of the Somali people,’ he said after voting, urging every citizen to ‘take the path of democracy’. The volatile nation has stepped up security ahead of the polls, with more than 10,000 security personnel deployed across the capital. ‘This is history today, it is a day the Somali people have gotten a new door opened, so that we call on the more than 500,000 people, who have taken the voting cards to come out and cast their votes,’ electoral commission chief Abdikarim Ahmed Hassan said while visiting a polling station in the south of the capital. Mogadishu police chief Moalim Mahdi told reporters that ‘we are committed to ensuring the safety and security of the people’ and urged ‘patience for each other as you cast your vote’. According to the country’s electoral body more than 1,600 candidates will contest 390 local council seats in the southeastern Banadir region that takes in the capital. Key opposition parties have boycotted the election, accusing the federal government of ‘unilateral election processes’. Somalia’s system of direct voting was abolished after Siad Barre took power in 1969. Since the fall of his authoritarian government in 1991, the country’s political system has revolved around a clan-based structure. Universal suffrage is, however, practised in the breakaway region of Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991 but has never been internationally recognised. In May 2023, the semi-autonomous northern state of Puntland held local elections by direct vote, but later abandoned the system for local and regional polls in January. Thursday’s vote has been postponed three times this year. Somalia has been battling Islamist Al-Shabaab militants since the mid-2000s, but security has deteriorated sharply this year, with the group retaking dozens of towns and villages and reversing most gains from the 2022–2023 military campaign. The electoral body boss Abdikarin Ahmed Hassan on Sunday said all movement would be restricted on election day and ‘the whole country will be shut down’. On Monday, the civil aviation authority announced that the country’s main airport would be closed on voting day. The election is seen as a test ahead of a presidential ballot due in 2026, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s term comes to an end. While the vote marks a pivotal moment for Somalia, security analyst Samira Gaid expressed scepticism, saying the process was ‘stage-managed’ to make the Horn of Africa nation ‘appear like a democracy’. ‘There is close to zero civilian participation. It’s mostly a government and security forces operation,’ Gaid told AFP, adding that the voter registration exercise had not been successful. The political strain is fuelling tensions ahead of next year’s national elections, with parliament’s mandate expiring in April and the president’s term ending in May. The International Crisis Group has warned that the situation resembles the 2021 political crisis that erupted under former president Mohamed Abdullahi ‘Farmajo’. That led to clashes between clan-based factions after he failed to organise parliamentary and presidential elections before his mandate expired. With the clock ticking, there is still no consensus on how the 2026 election will be conducted, and the opposition and federal member states are threatening to run a parallel process if no agreement is reached.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/286187/mogadishu-holds-first-local-vote-in-decades", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 699},
{"title": "Pope urges Russia, Ukraine talks", "body": "Pope Leo XIV on Thursday urged Russia and Ukraine to find the ‘courage’ to hold direct talks and spoke of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza in his first Christmas message. The US pope, who was elected by fellow cardinals in May after the death of his predecessor pope Francis, also condemned the ‘senselessness’ of war and the ‘rubble and open wounds’ it leaves behind. Speaking to a crowd of some 26,000 people in St Peter’s Square, the pope called for ‘solidarity with and acceptance of those in need’ in Europe—a possible reference to growing anti-immigration sentiment on the continent. ‘Let us pray in a particular way for the tormented people of Ukraine,’ he said. ‘May the parties involved, with the support and commitment of the international community, find the courage to engage in sincere, direct and respectful dialogue,’ he added. Russian and Ukrainian officials have spoken separately in recent weeks to US negotiators about proposals to end the war started by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Tens of thousands have been killed, eastern Ukraine decimated and millions forced to flee their homes. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky this week outlined key points of a plan to end the conflict after US talks. But Russian president Vladimir Putin has so far shown no willingness to compromise, doubling down on his hardline demands. In his first Christmas homily as pontiff, Leo addressed the dismal conditions in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters in wintry conditions weeks after a fragile ceasefire took hold. ‘How... can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold,’ the pope said, adding that the territory’s inhabitants ‘have nothing left and have lost everything.’ The UN has said that an estimated 1.3 million people currently need shelter assistance in Gaza and has warned of the increasing risk of hypothermia as temperatures dip. ‘The war, in all its forms, has been harsh on everyone living on this land,’ Elias al-Jalda, a Palestinian Christian from Gaza, told AFP after attending a Christmas mass at Gaza’s only Roman Catholic Church late on Wednesday. ‘We hope this year will mark the beginning of a new phase—one defined by a complete end to the war and the return of life to Gaza,’ said Jalda, one of dozens attending the mass. In Bethlehem, the Christian community celebrated its first festive Christmas in more than two years as the occupied West Bank city emerges from the shadow of the war in Gaza. Hundreds of worshippers gathered for mass on Wednesday night at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ. Hundreds also took part in the parade down Bethlehem’s narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square. ‘Today is full of joy because we haven’t been able to celebrate because of the war,’ said Milagros Anstas, 17. Men dressed as Santa Claus sold toffee apples and toys as families took photographs in front of a nativity scene framed by a giant star. As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity. In Syria, Christmas lights illuminated Damascus’s Old City despite the Christian community’s fears of violence after a deadly attack in June. Around the district, home to several important churches, red baubles hung from trees, shopkeepers put up Christmas decorations and street vendors peddled warm chestnuts. ‘Syria deserves joy and for us to be happy, and to hope for a new future,’ said student Loris Aasaf, 20. In the United States, President Donald Trump issued a starkly different message to those of religious leaders. He wished a Merry Christmas ‘to everyone, including the radical left-wing scum’, referring to Democrats. Severe weather disrupted the holiday season in California where authorities, fearing flooding, have declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and ordered evacuations. In Australia, prime minister Anthony Albanese had a sombre message after the deadly attack during a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach on December 14. ‘After the terror inflicted on Jewish Australia celebrating Hanukkah and Bondi Beach, we feel the weight of sorrow in our hearts,’ he said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/286236/pope-urges-russia-ukraine-talks", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 704},

{"title": "Growing India-Taliban ties anger neighbouring Pakistan", "body": "As fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan escalated into rare, bloody combat this month, Islamabad pointed fingers at another adversary, accusing India of fuelling the conflict. Pakistan’s prime minister Shehbaz Sharif said that New Delhi had ‘incited’ the Afghan Taliban, while his defence minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, described Kabul as acting like a ‘proxy of India’. Existential archrivals, Pakistan and India have fought repeated wars since partition cleaved the subcontinent at the end of British rule in 1947. They have also long swapped claims of stoking militancy in each other’s territory as part of alleged destabilisation campaigns. But in recent months, Islamabad has warily watched India cosy up to Taliban-governed Afghanistan, even as its own relations with Kabul sharply deteriorated. The diplomatic reconciliation culminated in the Taliban foreign minister’s arrival in New Delhi on October 9, the first visit by a top Taliban leader since the hardliners returned to power in 2021. As India rolled out the red carpet for UN-sanctioned minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, explosions rocked Kabul as well as a market near the Pakistan border. Wahid Faqiri, an Afghan expert in international relations, said rapprochement between India and the Taliban had compelled Pakistan to react. By inviting the Taliban foreign minister for a week of talks, New Delhi aimed to ‘aggravate the on-going tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan’, he said. While the October 9 explosions officially went unclaimed, the Taliban government accused Islamabad of an ‘unprecedented’ incursion, and retaliated with its own offensive. The exchanges set in motion more than a week of deadly artillery barrages and drone strikes — the worst violence between the South Asian neighbours in years. After an initial truce collapsed, a second ceasefire was inked on October 19. One-time allies Afghanistan and Pakistan have had frosty relations since the withdrawal of US-led troops and return of the Taliban government. Initially, Islamabad struck an optimistic tone, with then-intelligence chief Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed giving public assurances that ‘everything will be fine’. But Islamabad has since continuously accused the Taliban authorities of providing a safe haven to militant groups as deadly terror attacks in Pakistan surge. The Pakistani Taliban and its affiliates are behind much of the violence — largely directed at security forces. In October alone, over 100 security personnel and police officers were killed in attacks carried out by assailants from Afghanistan, a Pakistani security source said. For two years now, the rising violence in Pakistan has also helped fuel a mass deportation campaign, with millions of Afghan migrants and asylum seekers blamed for driving up crime and pushed back across the border. Former Pakistani diplomat Maleeha Lodhi said the Taliban foreign minister’s trip to New Delhi may have been an ‘irritant, but wasn’t the motivation for the Pakistani reprisals’. ‘The principal driver for Pakistan’s ire and frustration with the Taliban authorities is their refusal to rein in TTP,’ she said. Pakistan’s military has also accused New Delhi of supporting the TTP. India’s foreign ministry denies the charge, and instead accuses Pakistan of trying to evade responsibility for its domestic turmoil and security problems. ‘It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures,’ it said. The bonhomie between New Delhi and Kabul was initially ‘difficult to justify’ in India due to the dominant public perception of Islam as contrary to prime minister Narendra Modi’s popular Hindu nationalism, said Praveen Donthi, an analyst at International Crisis Group. The absence of women journalists at an initial press conference during Muttaqi’s visit also sparked strong criticism, but public opinion shifted, Donthi said, when the Taliban minister expressed ‘solidarity’ with India over an April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam. That attack in the flashpoint Kashmir region precipitated a four-day war between the nuclear-armed foes, with New Delhi accusing Islamabad of backing the terrorists. The Afghan minister’s solidarity may have bought him some fans in India, but it aggravated Islamabad, with the joint statement describing the disputed region as ‘Jammu and Kashmir, India’ — suggesting Indian sovereignty. At the end of the Afghanistan-India exchange, New Delhi announced it would upgrade its diplomatic mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. That represented another stepping stone towards the Taliban government’s ultimate goal of formal international recognition, a move only Moscow has made and that analysts say remains far off for India. For now, the rekindling is a significant win for the Taliban authorities, and a pointed shift in the complex India-Pakistan-Afghanistan relations.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/279629/growing-india-taliban-ties-anger-neighbouring-pakistan", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 737},
{"title": "US ends 15pc tariff on Ghana cocoa, farm exports", "body": "Ghana has received official confirmation from the United States that Washington has fully removed the 15 per cent tariff imposed on the West African nation’s cocoa and agricultural exports, its foreign minister announced Monday. The move comes at a sensitive moment in Ghana–US relations. Accra recently accepted dozens of deportees from the United States — exclusively West Africans — on what the government described as humanitarian grounds, despite domestic criticism over the arrangement. Washington also reversed its visa restrictions on Ghanaian travellers after months of dialogue. ‘The United States administration has officially informed the Government of Ghana that President Trump’s 15% imposition of tariffs on Cocoa and certain qualifying agricultural products from Ghana have been rescinded,’ foreign affairs minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa posted on X. He added that American diplomats had confirmed to him that ‘the 15% tariff reversal came into effect on November 13, 2025 following president Trump’s new Executive Order.’ The tariff rollback reverses a Trump-era policy that had sharply raised the cost of Ghanaian produce entering the US market. Ghana exports an average of 78,000 tonnes of cocoa beans to the United States annually. At the current spot price of $5,300 per tonne, the minister added, the country ‘stands to raise additional revenue of US$60 million... each year resulting from Trump’s tariff rescission’. The exemptions covered other Ghanaian agricultural products including cashew nuts, avocados, bananas, mangoes, plantain, pineapples, coconuts, ginger and peppers, he said. ‘Ghana welcomes this positive development from the US which is the world’s leading importer of chocolate and cocoa products. Ghana and the USA will continue to forge closer and mutually beneficial relations,’ he added. Analysts say the tariff removal is a significant diplomatic win following years of tension over deportations and documentation compliance. ‘It’s a win-win situation for both countries,’ Accra-based economist Daniel Amateye Anim-Prempeh of the Policy Initiative for Economic Development (PIED) told AFP. ‘The cocoa sector, the backbone of Ghana’s agricultural economy, stands to gain the most from improved access to the US market.’ Ghana, the world’s second-largest cocoa producer, relies heavily on export revenues to stabilise its currency and finance public spending.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/283140/us-ends-15pc-tariff-on-ghana-cocoa-farm-exports", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 352},
{"title": "Osman Hadi, Abu Sayeed and Abrar Fahad", "body": "DEATH is the ultimate and inescapable destiny of human life. No matter how mighty one is or how desperately one wishes to cling to life, death will embrace them. Fir’aun (Pharaoh), the ancient Egyptian ruler, arrogated to himself the godly status, but the aquatic end of his life proved that he was no more than humans. He died a humiliating death. Conversely, there are deaths that ennoble lives, making them unforgettable. These are deaths of those who risk not dying a natural death for a higher calling. Those whose lives are snatched away rather prematurely by forces of evil; those who lived more for others than for themselves; those who could have given so much more had they lived longer to reach the full potential in their lives. By taking those exceptional lives, their killers not only eliminate them but also rob society and humanity of gems and treasures. However, these are deaths which are also deathless. Paradoxically, their death promises a longer life — a life which cannot be touched by death any more and secured from oblivion. Osman Hadi, Abu Sayeed and Abrar Fahad are blessed with such deaths and deathlessness. They met the tragic end of their lives at the hand of their killers at young ages. However, their deaths have an indelible print on our minds. One other such death is that of president Ziaur Rahman. Hadi and Ziaur Rahman embraced martyrdom 44 years apart. In both cases, the city of Dhaka was turned into a funeral prayer site. Abu Sayeed and Abrar Fahad did not have such funeral congregations because Hasina’s autocracy did not allow people to congregate to show their last respect to them. Hadi, Sayeed, and Abrar all lost their lives essentially for the same cause. It is justice, dignity and freedom. It is for speaking or standing against the hegemony of a regional superpower and its local agents. Their killers, architects and financiers belonged to the same political tribe. It is surprising that those who caused their deaths claimed to be associated with our national independence in 1971. They presented themselves as the sole agent of our freedom from Pakistani colonialism. However, it is now clear that they wanted to free us from Pakistan to sell our freedom to India. Such a reading may appear one-sidedly preposterous. However, we just need to consider the current location of the Awami forces, including their leader and the havoc they have been wreaking on our country. We should also recollect who they truly served during their autocratic rule. Abrar Fahad was a promising student at the Bangladeshi University of Engineering and Technology. As a young man of dignity, freedom, and justice and a patriotic citizen, he could not accept the Awami government’s servitude to India. He spoke against bilateral treaties which were unfair and unjust to Bangladesh. In any democratic and independent nation, Abrar would have been commended for his visceral nationalistic sentiments. However, he could not expect anything better when the government in power acted as an agent of their Indian master. Abrar was beaten to death with unprecedented cruelty by those who were called the golden children of the so-called pro-independent forces. What an irony! That irony is now clear. We now know who are for and against dependence or independence of our hapless nation. Abrar was killed in the most barbaric manner, but he has not died. Chhatra League hooligans, in fact, brought him a life beyond death. This writing itself is evidence of his living and being remembered with love and respect. Abu Sayeed was the catalyst of the July 2024 movement which freed the country not only from Hasina’s autocracy but also from the hegemonic patron of her misrule. He embraced the bullets of the Awami police. His way of giving life is exceptional not only in this country but, maybe, in the whole world. Bullets took his mortal life but gave him some kind of immortality in return. Those who love Bangladesh and those who love freedom and justice will love Abu Syeed. He will never be forgotten. By embracing death, he showed us how to live. The unbearable death of Osman Hadi is still fresh with us. The soil of his grave on the central mosque premises of the University of Dhaka has not yet settled. His killers took his life because he challenged the established political elitism and, thus, became the voice of Bangladesh in the post-autocracy era. He embodied what the best Bangladeshi looks like — pious without prejudice, honest without pretension and humble without exception. He was a loving father and an admired husband. He was not a politician, but still he showed us how to do politics, lead our nation and love our country. He gave us an outstanding example of how to live, even if living meant holding life in your hands. He taught us how to speak fearlessly, no matter what price must be paid for speaking. Of the many voices that have been active in politics and media in recent Bangladesh, his was the most authentic one, commanding an audience. A voice that people from all walks of life — except those of the hegemonic forces — gave a hearing. A voice that was polite and courteous but never missed to point out the root cause of our dirty and deplorable politics. Abrar dreamt of a free Bangladesh; Sayeed wished for a Bangladesh that would be free from autocrats; Hadi wanted a Bangladesh where people would live with dignity with other nations in the region and beyond. Unfortunately, their lives were cut short before their wishes and dreams could materialise. These best and most promising of Bangladeshis were killed by the same evil forces of servitude, autocracy and moral bankruptcy. They eliminated the best sons of the soil so the country could continue serving the hegemonic interests of a regional big brother. We as a nation have a colossal debt of gratitude to them. We also have a great responsibility towards them for our own interest. First, we must do the opposite of what their killers did — they sought to erase them from Bangladesh’s map, mind and mission. We should establish them more firmly everywhere, in politics, education, culture and history. We will tell their killers that the trios are more alive after their deaths and that their voices of resistance are more commanding now than when they lived. Second, we should sustain their legacy of justice, truth and freedom. Those who intend to compromise these ideals, those who seek alliance with their killers, should be rejected not just through the ballot but also socially, politically and culturally. Third, no matter which party rules this country, the courage and heroism of these souls must be invested, utilised and immortalised so that we have their likes in the future. We need to create more Abrars, more Hadis, more Sayeeds and innumerable other July 2024 martyrs and warriors so that their legacy can continue. We need them across generations who will keep telling us that the value of life lies in giving it selflessly when needed. That true honour and dignity do not lie in slavery or in running away; that life gathers its meaning when death can be embraced without compromising higher ideals. Bangladesh cannot afford to forget these great souls. They must live in our heart, on pages of our books, in our soil and in the air. Like Laurence Binyon in his poem ‘For the Fallen’, we should recite: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.

Rafi, who has been training in Thailand on an Olympic scholarship for the past two years, set a new national record in the 200m individual medley, clocking 2:08:92 seconds to break his own previous record of 2:09:99 seconds in 2024.

{"title": "US to reduce flights as longest govt shutdown continues", "body": "US officials said the scheduled capacity for flights would be reduced by 10 per cent in 40 busy air traffic areas nationwide on Friday as the longest government shutdown continues. Federal agencies have been grinding to a halt since Congress failed to approve funding past September 30, with some 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, still on enforced leave or working without pay. ‘There is going to be a 10 per cent reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations,’ Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told a White House news briefing on Wednesday, adding that the cuts would come into effect on Friday. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Bryan Bedford said the reductions would be at ‘40 high traffic environment markets.’ The official list of affected airports is expected to be published later on Thursday but, according to US media outlets, flights will be reduced at some of the busiest airports in the nation, including Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Washington. International flights would not be affected by this measure, a source speaking on condition of anonymity told ABC News. Flight reductions will begin at 4 per cent on Friday and gradually reach 10 per cent, media outlets reported. AFP contacted the Department of Transport and FAA seeking more details about the airports that would be affected. United Airlines issued a statement on social media that said ‘long-haul international and hub-to-hub flights will not be impacted.’ More than 10,000 flights to or from the United States experienced delays last weekend, according to the tracking service FlightAware. The government shutdown became the longest in US history on Wednesday, eclipsing the 35-day record set during President Donald Trump's first term. Airport workers calling in sick rather than working without pay -- which led to significant delays -- was a major factor in Trump bringing an end to that 2019 shutdown. More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers are now working without pay, and the White House has warned that increased absenteeism could create chaos at check-in lines. House Speaker Mike Johnson said in late October that five per cent of flight delays had been the result of staffing shortages but that number had now increased to more than 50 per cent. He warned at the time that the ‘longer the shutdown goes on, and as fewer air traffic controllers show up to work, the safety of the American people is thrown further into jeopardy.’ However, Democrats and Republicans have both remained unwavering over the main sticking point in the shutdown: health care spending. Democrats say they will only provide votes to end the funding lapse after a deal has been struck to extend expiring insurance subsidies that make health care affordable for millions of Americans. Republicans insist they will only address health care once Democrats have voted to switch the lights back on in Washington. Trump has sought to apply his own pressure to force Democrats to cave by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and using the shutdown to target progressive priorities. He repeated on Tuesday his administration's threat to cut off a vital aid program that helps 42 million Americans pay for groceries for the first time in the scheme's more than 60-year history, even though the move was blocked by two courts. The White House later clarified that it was ‘fully complying’ with its legal obligations and was working to get partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments ‘out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/281340/us-to-reduce-flights-as-longest-govt-shutdown-continues", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 593},
{"title": "Businesses seek punitive measures for bond misuse", "body": "The business community of readymade garments and textiles sector urged the National Board of Revenue to punish those who misuse duty-free bond facilities, instead of harassing genuine exporters for avoidable mistakes. They also urged the disclosure of the names of businesses abusing the bond facility, as it is their wrongdoing that harms legitimate businesses. They were speaking at the ‘Meet the Business’ event organised by the NBR at the Revenue Building in capital’s Agargaon on Sunday. NBR chairman Abdur Rahman Khan presided over the monthly routine talks. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said those who misuse bonded warehousing facilities never face consequences. ‘Take timely action against the offenders, if necessary, publishes their photos in newspapers,’ he added. Urging the government to consider withdrawing HS codes for import of goods under bond licences, he said, ‘the major complications arise because of HS codes. At the end of the year, we submit our accounts down to the last penny, so why should HS codes create additional hassles? He also said that due to errors in HS codes, businesses are even accused of false declarations. He further said that frequent transfers of revenue officers and assistant revenue officers cause files to remain pending for long periods. ‘Small enterprises also struggle to secure bank guarantees and we demand special consideration for them,’ he added. The businesses were responding to the NBR chairman›s comment on the misuse of the bond facility by the businesses. In this regard, Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said they are concerned that the next day they may see news of widespread misuse of bonds. ‘Don›t make the entire business community responsible for a few misusers. Identify the culprits clearly,’ he urged the NBR chairman. ‹We have already warned 22 of our factories not to engage in such practices. We will not accept a situation where the entire industry is blamed because of the misconduct of a handful,’ he added. He also said that businesses without bond licences have already been allowed to import raw materials using bank guarantees. ‘If this system becomes fully functional, at least 200 of our members will surrender their bond licences as maintaining a bond licence is complicated and many want to be free from that hassle,’ he added. On the decision to shift the authority to grant tax exemptions to Parliament, Mahmud Hasan welcomed the move. ‘The NBR chairman will no longer have this authority, nor will the finance adviser. It must go to Parliament, and we appreciate that. At the same time, we want to ensure that any facility withdrawn should also go through Parliament. Sudden withdrawal of benefits through SROs should no longer happen; that authority should also lie with Parliament,’ he added. Responding to the BGMEA president’s request, the NBR chairman said they would share the list of bond licence users, but it cannot be shared. He announced that bond officials will soon undergo a week-long training programme, and those failing to qualify may face difficulties continuing in their roles, and incompetent officials could be dismissed. NBR chairman also said that facing rising external debt and limited fiscal space, the government is under pressure from development partners to boost revenue through tougher tax policies and reduced exemptions. Abdur Rahman Khan said Bangladesh’s mounting debt obligations and the need for sustainable budget financing have left very limited choices beyond enhancing domestic revenue collection rather than resorting to repeated external borrowing. He also said that Bangladesh’s low tax-to-GDP ratio is often attributed to a long-standing culture of tax exemptions, a practice that has continued for nearly five decades. Although exemptions were historically provided to address development needs, he stressed that the current economic situation now requires a fundamental shift towards a more disciplined and equitable tax structure. To address this, the government has introduced a Revenue and Tax Expenditure Policy this year and amended multiple tax-related laws, including those related to income tax and customs. Under the new directive, the NBR and ministries will no longer have the authority to grant any tax exemption.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/trade-commerce/282347/businesses-seek-punitive-measures-for-bond-misuse", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 684},

{"title": "Barnstorming Bayern face acid test at PSG", "body": "Bayern Munich’s trip to holders Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Tuesday is a test to determine where they stand among the European elite this season. Bayern have won 15 from 15 matches in all competitions so far this campaign, setting a new record for the best start to a season in the top five European leagues. The incredible start has Bayern dreaming of Champions League glory. But taking on the European champions in their own back yard will provide the Bavarian giants with a clearer understanding of where they measure up. Bayern have had an incredible start to the season, breaking a record set by AC Milan in 1992-93. Bayern have only been behind for five minutes during their run, in Wednesday’s 4-1 German Cup win over Cologne. The Bavarians have beaten the teams placed second to fifth in the Bundesliga table domestically, as well as Club World Cup winners Chelsea. Coach Vincent Kompany has Bayern firing across the park but the star of the show has undoubtedly been Harry Kane. Far from resting on his laurels after finally lifting a trophy last season when Bayern won the Bundesliga, Kane has gone to another level. The England captain has 22 goals in 15 games in all competitions, but his creative impact has been crucial with the injured Jamal Musiala out for six months. Kompany has begun playing Kane as a number 10 and encouraging him to drop deep, sometimes as far as defensive midfield. Even squad rotation has not stopped the Bayern machine from rolling on. On Saturday, Kompany benched Kane, wingers Luis Diaz and Michael Olise along with central defender Dayot Upamecano for a match against Bayer Leverkusen, who Bayern had not beaten in the league since 2022. The Bavarians were 3-0 up at half-time, with the reborn Serge Gnabry and improving Chelsea loanee Nicolas Jackson among the scorers. ‘We’ve won 15 games, that’s good. But it has to continue -- it’s not enough yet,’ Kompany told fans at Bayern’s AGM on Sunday. ‘I promise we will do everything to give you a successful season.’ Like Bayern, more often than not PSG can comfortably dispose of their domestic rivals and are judged by their European exploits. Last season, PSG finally delivered on the continental stage, hitting form at just the right time. The Parisians won their first Champions League title in June, thrashing Inter Milan at Bayern’s Allianz Arena. PSG are yet to hit their straps in Ligue 1 this season, but have saved their best performances for Europe. With three games played -- all victories -- PSG sit atop the Champions League table, one place ahead of Bayern. PSG won at Barcelona, thumped Atalanta and annihilated Leverkusen 7-2 away. ‘Two top teams are meeting each other,’ said Bayern sporting director Max Eberl. ‘We’re going there, we’re still unbeaten at the moment. We want to keep it that way.’", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/281048/barnstorming-bayern-face-acid-test-at-psg", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 482},

The commission’s deputy assistant director, Md Rubel Hossain, filed the case with its integrated district office in Dhaka-1, said ACC deputy director for public relations Aktarul Islam. The others accused in the case are former United Commercial Bank director Syed Kamruzzaman, Aramit PLC assistant general manager and Imperial Trading owner Md Abdul Aziz, Aramit AGM and Classic Trading owner Md Jahangir Alam, Aramit employee and Model Trading owner Md Mishababul Alam, Crescent Traders owner Syed Nurul Islam and Radius Trading owner Md Farid Uddin. According to the case statement, the accused in collusion with each other abused power through fraud and deception. The accused allegedly intimidated Saif Powertec Ltd and E-Engineering PLC’s managing director, Torfadar Ruhul Amin, a customer of UCB’s Mohakhali branch, and took Tk 41.75 crore in bribes from him in several instalments. Later, the money was transferred and laundered abroad. Earlier, on September 18, the commission filed a case against Saifuzzaman, his wife and 9 other people over allegations of taking Tk 52 crore in bribes from Abdul Kadir Molla, managing director of Thermex Group. On September 18, a Chattogram metropolitan special judge court ordered the Police Headquarters to seek an Interpol red notice against Saifuzzaman and his wife in a money laundering case. The ACC is conducting probes in several cases filed over allegations of embezzling and laundering money against Saifuzzaman and his wife, who was also former UCB chairperson. Saifuzzaman, a former lawmaker from the Chattogram-13 constituency, served as state minister for land from 2014 to 2018 and as land minister from 2019 to 2023 during the Awami League regime.

{"title": "Simeone calls for more protection after Liverpool scuffle", "body": "Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone called for managers to be offered more protection from supporter abuse after being sent off for a furious reaction towards Liverpool fans at Anfield on Wednesday. Simeone confronted supporters behind his dugout after Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk headed in a 92nd-minute winner as the Reds edged a dramatic Champions League opener 3-2. Atletico's combustible coach admitted he should not have reacted but said managers should benefit from similar campaigns that aim to drive racism out of football. ‘In the same way we fight against racism, we should look at this too because we don't have a right to respond and it is not easy to be insulted during the entire match,’ said Simeone. ‘My reaction isn't justifiable but do you know what it is like to be insulted for 90 minutes? ‘I hope Liverpool can improve that aspect and that when they identify the person who did that, there will be consequences. ‘There were insults throughout the match, including gestures. It's clear that I'm the one who has to stay calm, I have to put up with the insults, the gestures and any situation because I'm in a position where I have to put up with it.’ Liverpool boss Arne Slot said he hoped the focus would be on a ‘great’ match rather than the incident after the winning goal. Slot's men have now won all their opening five Premier League and Champions League games with goals scored after the 80th minute. The Dutch coach paid tribute to his side's fitness levels as well as their mentality and quality for finding a way to win. ‘It is not only mentality, it's also how fit we are, how well prepared we are, that they are able to push one more time,’ said Slot. But Slot said he was ‘disappointed’ to have needed another late winner on a night where Liverpool's new-look attack, that included a first start for British transfer record signing Alexander Isak, clicked into gear. ‘This is what the new (Champions League) format is about, a first game in a group stage that could be a quarter-final or a semi-final,’ he added. ‘A game like this should not have gone to a late game winner. ‘I understand that's the story of this game and the last five games, but for me it is a different game than the ones we played before.

{"title": "UK govt borrowing highest since Covid pandemic", "body": "UK government borrowing has reached the highest level since the start of the Covid pandemic, official data revealed Friday, dealing a blow to the government ahead of its annual budget. The public deficit between April — the start of the UK fiscal year — and August hit £83.8 billion ($113 billion), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement. Since records began in 1993, the amount is second only to that seen during the same five-month period in 2020 when the pandemic took hold. The ONS added that in August the deficit, or difference between public spending and tax revenue, was £18 billion, up £3.5 billion from a year earlier. The Labour government led by prime minister Keir Starmer has overseen a mostly stalled UK economy since winning power in July last year. Labour’s troubles worsened this month when the yield on 30-year UK government bonds hit its highest level since 1998, with concerns growing about soaring state debt. Focus is on the upcoming budget at the end of November, with economists expecting finance minister Rachel Reeves to hike taxes in order to help balance the books. Reeves already increased certain levies in her inaugural budget last October, which experts argue has hindered UK economy growth. Friday’s data ‘is going to lead to calls about the sustainability of public finances, and the need for tax rises at the upcoming budget’, noted Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group.

{"title": "Denmark launches new partnership to back rights, mental health, media freedom in Bangladesh", "body": "Denmark has launched a new partnership to strengthen human rights, trauma-informed mental health and media freedom in Bangladesh. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, has called on civil society and state institutions to strengthen the country’s capacity in human rights and help build a more inclusive future. In response, the Embassy of Denmark in Bangladesh has announced its support of DKK 25 million to a consortium consisting of DIGNITY, IMS, and the Danish Institute for Human Rights. The consortium will partner with local actors to advance human rights, free independent media and access to rehabilitation for survivors of violence and torture. ‘Right now, there is a unique opportunity to strengthen civil society in Bangladesh and address important challenges of human rights violations and impunity, said Christian Brix Møller, Danish ambassador to Bangladesh on Monday. We strongly believe that the upcoming program will contribute to revitalising the pursuit of justice and democratic reform for the people of Bangladesh, as the three consortium partners have the relevant expertise to support civil society in promoting human rights and democracy, the ambassador said. Each of the three organisations in the consortium has extensive experience of working in countries marked by both repressive regimes and democratic transition processes where support for civil society is essential. A strong civil society is crucial in advancing human rights and securing accountability and rehabilitation for survivors of torture and violence. In DIGNITY we look very much forward to supporting local partners with capacity building and help them deliver survivor-centered approaches and strengthen referral systems for the benefit of the survivors, said Rasmus Grue Christensen, CEO of DIGNITY. Executive director at IMS, Jesper Højberg agrees with Rasmus Grue Christensen about the importance of a strong civil society. ‘At IMS, we know that meaningful change is only possible through genuine partnership. By working closely with local organisations, civil society and government, we aim to strengthen the foundations of Bangladesh’s media sector. Our shared goal is to ensure that every person in Bangladesh has access to trustworthy, independent information. Together, we can build a media environment where diverse voices are heard, journalists are protected, and the public’s right to reliable news is upheld—laying the groundwork for a more open and resilient society,’ he said. The Danish Institute for Human Rights will have a particular focus on supporting the reform of the country’s National Human Rights Institution, Bangladesh’s National Human Rights Commission. ‘We see a unique opportunity to support both institutional reform and civic engagement in Bangladesh. Reforming the National Human Rights Commission is key, and to be effective, our engagement will also build bridges and work with civil society and youth to articulate human rights demands and shape the country’s future. Our role is to help connect these actors and support a coherent, inclusive transition,’ says Mette Thygesen, international director of Danish Institute for Human Rights. DIGNITY will work to strengthen the capacity of local civil society to provide trauma-informed mental health and psychosocial support to survivors of torture and violence as well as address the lack of access to justice for survivors. The organisation will support the local capacity by providing training and mentoring to equip local partners to deliver services, applying survivor-centered approaches, while contributing to strengthening the systemic access to services in collaboration with state actors and private and public providers through the development of a stronger referral system to expand survivors’ access to rehabilitation and legal services. International Media Support aims to foster a pluralistic, inclusive, and resilient media environment during the country’s fragile political transition. Its core objectives in Bangladesh include supporting inclusive media reform, establishing national safety mechanisms for journalists, and strengthening emerging independent media through funding, capacity building, and strategic partnerships. IMS’ Bangladesh programme will be operated through three complementary tracks and it will engage stakeholders across civil society, government and the media sector. The Danish Institute for Human Rights will build on its experience in peer support for National Human Rights Institutions and convening and collaborating with a broad range of human rights actors. The Danish Institute for Human Rights will support the reform of Bangladesh’s National Human Rights Commission, into a strong and independent national human rights institution that can act as a watchdog, an ally of human rights defenders, and as an adviser to the future government of Bangladesh, and collaborate with civil society organisations, human rights defenders, academic and public authorities to embed human rights in the ongoing reforms.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign-affairs/281745/denmark-launches-new-partnership-to-back-rights-mental-health-media-freedom-in-bangladesh", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 742},

This decision marks the first time in the ACC history that a former chairman of the commission is facing an inquiry by the commission. Confirming about the inquiry against Iqbal, ACC director general (Money Laundering) Md Mokammel Haque on Monday said that a decision had been made to initiate an inquiry the allegations against him. According to ACC officials, controversial health-sector contractor Motazzerul Islam Mithu and members of Iqbal Mahmood’s family allegedly had close business ties. Iqbal’s brother, Sadiq Mahmood Bokul, was reportedly a business associate of Mithu. Using this connection, they became involved in widespread irregularities and corruption in the health sector. However, both Mithu and Bokul had long remained beyond the reach of the law due to Iqbal Mahmood’s influence during his tenure as ACC chairman. The officials further said that the ACC was also examining the allegation that Iqbal Mahmood had received two apartments in Gulshan, Dhaka, from contractor Mithu while there was also an allegation of money laundering, abuse of power, and the accumulation of illegal wealth against Iqbal Mahmood. Additionally, the commission will scrutinise the sources of wealth of his brother Sadiq Mahmood Bokul, their possible overseas transactions, and financial records of their joint business ventures. On September 11, police arrested Mithu on charges of forming a ‘syndicate to embezzle and launder money’ from the health sector. Based on information gathered from him, the ACC stated that it has received significant evidence regarding widespread irregularities, laundered funds, and the involvement of influential individuals in the health sector. That information prompted the decision to run inquiry against the ACC former chairman. A 1981 batch Bangladesh Civil Service officer, Iqbal Mahmood once served as acting secretary of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. He was promoted to secretary in June 2008. After the Awami League came to power the following year, he was appointed secretary of the Establishment Ministry (now the Ministry of Public Administration). In 2012, when the government created the new position of ‘senior secretary,’ Iqbal was among the first seven officials elevated to the rank. At the time, he was serving at the Economic Relations Division. Later that same year, in November, he was appointed Alternate Executive Director of the Asian Development Bank. After completing his tenure there, he retired from government service on November 29, 2014. In August 2015, after his retirement, the government appointed him as the chair of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, but he was removed from the post within a month. Later on March, 14, 2016, Iqbal Mahmood assumed office of the ACC chair and he was in the position till March 9, 2021.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/283880/ex-acc-chair-iqbal-mahmood-under-scanner-on-graft-charges", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 460},
{"title": "Atletico recover momentum with battling win", "body": "Atletico Madrid returned to winning ways in La Liga with a 2-1 victory over Valencia on Saturday, sealed by a fine Antoine Griezmann strike. Goals by captain Koke and Griezmann brought Diego Simeone’s fourth-placed side within six points of leaders Barcelona, who host Osasuna later on. Atletico had muscled their way back into the Spanish title race after a slow start to the season, before suffering damaging consecutive Liga defeats by Barca and Athletic Bilbao at the start of December. They followed up a Champions League victory at PSV in midweek with a solid display at their Metropolitano stadium against Los Che. ‘We made a big effort in the Champions League, it was hard for us to find our rhythm, and in the end it was the substitutes who gave that spark and that speed, so that we could win today,’ Griezmann, brought on in the second half, told DAZN. Valencia began well, Hugo Duro hitting the crossbar, but were undone by a scramble at a corner. Goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala repelled one effort but was unable to do anything as Koke slid home the rebound. The visitors thought they had levelled through Pepelu after 35 minutes but the goal was disallowed after a VAR review for offside against Duro in the build-up. Target man Alexander Sorloth could have extended Atletico’s lead before half-time after charging into the box but Agirrezabala denied him. Valencia, 16th, pulled level soon after the hour, with Beltran’s blast from distance catching out Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak. The Argentine forward showed neat footwork on the edge of the box before smashing a strike inside the near post. Simeone’s side pulled in front decisively through Griezmann, who plucked Marc Pubill’s long ball out of the sky with a raised left leg, read the ball’s bounce and lashed it past Agirrezabala for his fifth league goal. Sorloth had a goal ruled out for offside before the end, with Valencia unable to threaten Oblak’s goal.

{"title": "One thirds of bank loans now classified as defaults: Bangladesh Bank", "body": "Non-performing loans in the banking sector jumped to about Tk 6 lakh crore at the end of June, marking the sharpest quarterly rise on record and exposing the scale of hidden bad debts that have now come to light under stricter reporting and inspection by the central bank. Bangladesh Bank data showed that defaulted loans rose by Tk 1.8 lakh crore in just three months from March, when the figure stood at Tk 4.2 lakh crore. A year earlier, NPLs were Tk 2.11 lakh crore, or 12.56 per cent of total lending, indicating the amount has nearly tripled within twelve months and now accounts for 34.6 per cent of total Tk 17.34 lakh crore loan disbursements at the end of June this year. Experts said that the surge reflects years of weak governance, political influence in lending and repeated rescheduling that kept large defaults off the books. They said that non-performing loans accumulated during the previous government as politically connected borrowers received relaxed terms, avoided enforcement and benefited from extended restructuring windows. The figure was only Tk 22,481 crore in 2009. They also said that recent unrest and a sluggish economy also constrained borrowers’ cash flow, pushing more loans into overdue status. Many businesses linked with the former ruling network have scaled down operations or stopped repayment altogether. Bangladesh Bank tightened classification rules as part of reforms. The default recognition period was reduced from 270 days to 180 days in September 2024 and then to 90 days in April this year, matching international practices. Inspections also reclassified several large exposures after on-site audits. The banking regulator reported that delayed renewal of revolving credit lines, unpaid instalments under earlier rescheduled loans and accumulated interest added to the rise. State-owned banks remain the most stressed, with almost half of their loans now classified as non-performing. In private banks, the share is about one-third, according to the latest breakdown. BB officials said that the total could increase further as inspections continue and reporting discrepancies are corrected. They noted that while new politically motivated lending has stopped, the system is still burdened by legacy defaults. They suggested legal enforcement against wilful defaulters and proposed setting up a specialised asset recovery entity to manage distressed portfolios and speed up settlement.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/283216/one-thirds-of-bank-loans-now-classified-as-defaults-bangladesh-bank", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 375},

Yamal was also in the spotlight for comments before the game insinuating Madrid ‘steal (and) complain’ which riled Los Blancos fans and a big part of the Spanish media. ‘We speak with him... we are very honest together, he with me and I with him and this is the best way,’ Flick told a news conference ahead of Barca's match against Elche on Sunday in La Liga. ‘I will always protect him and support him. He's a fantastic player, fantastic guy, he's very young and we will go on this way.’ Yamal has been struggling with a groin injury for a few weeks and although he started the Clasico, he put in a subdued performance and still seems affected by the issue. ‘Lamine is good.

Several people from both sides were injured during the clashes while the law enforcers used baton, sound grenades and tear gas at the group. The vehicular movement at Dhanmondi 32 on the Mirpur Road was disrupted for about six hours while most shops kept their shutters down as the law enforces took positions there to bar the protesters from advancing towards the Mujib’s house. ‘Several sound grenades were used to disperse the protesters. A few members of the police suffered minor injuries during the confrontations,’ said Kya Swe Nu, officer-in-charge of the Dhanmondi police station. Members of the law enforcement agencies, including the police, army, Rapid Action Battalion and Border Guard Bangladesh, were deployed at the scene to avoid any untoward situation, he added. Witnesses said that several hundred people, including students, had begun to assemble near Dhanmondi 32 in a procession since 11:30am on Monday, chanting slogans against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s daughter Sheikh Hasina, who was sentenced to death in the case over atrocities during the 2024 July uprising that ousted the Awami League regime in August past year. The people brought two excavators with the intention of dismantling the house, which had been partially demolished during a demonstration in February. Before that, the house was partly demolished and burned down by protesters for the first time on August 5, 2024, after the fall of the Hasina regime. The protesters said that they went there to remove the rubbles of the house which they termed ‘symbol of the fascist’. At about 12:30pm, a section of the protesters tried to break through police barricades but the law enforcers dispersed them with charging batons and using sound grenades. The protesters then divided into groups and tried to move to Dhanmondi-32 in phases. Later, the protesters again attempted to break through police and army barricades several times since 3:00pm, resulting into several clashes among the protesters and the law enforcers. Law enforces again chased the protesters, including students from surrounding colleges, from Dhanmondi-32 towards Abahani Field as per the last update at about 9:00pm after the protesters attacked three police vehicles at about 7:00pm. As of 9:00pm, members of the army, RAB, BGB and police were seen deployed at the Dhanmondi-32 crossing while the protesters were seen in groups in nearby alleys. The International Crimes Tribunal-1 on Monday sentenced Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan to death while former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun received a reduced sentence of five years over atrocities during the 2024 July uprising.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/282462/fresh-attempt-to-demolish-mujib-house-at-dhanmondi-32-triggers-clash", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 472},

They also said that as traditional approaches lose impact, insight-driven ideas rooted in real human behaviour and cultural relevance are becoming the strongest tools for meaningful storytelling. They were speaking at the 14th edition of Bangladesh Communication Summit, organised by SMC Enterprise Ltd and Walton Group at a hotel in the capital on Saturday. At his welcoming speech, Sajid Mahbub, group CEO and executive editor of Bangladesh Brand Forum, said the rapid evolution of global communication demands sharper creativity and deeper empathy. ‘The world of communication is evolving faster than ever before. Amidst the noise and uncertainty, creativity has become our most powerful compass,’ he added. He also said that the summit aimed to rethink how culture, insight, and purposeful storytelling could help brands craft meaningful narratives and deliver better business outcomes. In his keynote, Tanzeen Alam, country head, Bangladesh and SEA, Emami Limited, emphasised that creativity becomes truly effective only when it solves real business problems. ‘Habits don’t change unless people understand why they should,’ he added, urging brands to rethink traditional approaches with sharper and insight-driven thinking. He highlighted the power of simplicity, noting that a five-second spark, a witty twist, or a strong cultural cue can often stand out more than heavy production. Tanzeen also stressed that humour, nostalgia, and relatable emotion can transform everyday challenges into engaging narratives, adding that meaningful ideas come from immersing in consumers› real lives and understanding their experiences. The keynote session, comprised of three keynotes, also set creativity as a strategic problem-solving method in business, highlighted the growing complacency of digital-era brands through the Zohran Mamdani Campaign, and outlined the communication frameworks required to convert brand noise into coherent, resonant narratives. Awrup Irfan Sanyal, head and creative strategist at Mighty, and Taufique Mahmud, executive creative director at Mediacom Limited, also spoke at the keynote sessions. Four panel discussions focused on building stronger client–agency partnerships and balancing content scale with creative depth. The discussions also highlighted creative approaches rooted in meaning, emotion, and cultural understanding—elements increasingly vital for long-term brand value. Speakers stressed the need for fair processes—including proper pitch fees and balanced agreements, so both sides can contribute meaningfully. They added that agencies bring cross-industry insight, while clients provide data and context, and that combining these strengths is essential to staying future-ready. The panel agreed that long-term trust forms when teams work as true partners through joint research and open problem-solving.

{"title": "Long-route passengers from 3 northern dists continue to suffer", "body": "Long-route passengers, mainly bound for Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet and Cox’s Bazar, from three northern districts continued to suffer on Saturday as long-route bus services from the districts, Rajshahi, Natore and Chapainawabganj, remained suspended for the third consecutive day. The services remained suspended amid renewed disputes between transport owners and workers over the workers’ wages and allowances. At Rajshahi city’s Shiroil bus terminal, passengers who arrived in the morning were seen leaving in frustration. Many alleged that although they had bought advance tickets, staff at ticket counters refused to give the money back and gave no information about the resumption of the services. Only buses of Ekota Paribahan continued operating on the routes, while all other services remained shut. A Dhaka-bound passenger Kamal Hossain said that he was supposed to leave Friday night but had to rely on local buses, auto-rickshaws and rented vehicles instead. ‘Normally it costs Tk 700, but this time I had to spend nearly Tk 1,200,’ he said. Another passenger, Raihan Hossain, said that he came to the terminal at dawn after hearing that services would resume. ‘But nothing happened. Now I must rent a vehicle with others. We are being held hostage,’ he said. Earlier this month, transport workers enforced two rounds of strikes demanding higher wages and allowances. The owners claimed that those demands were already met in a tripartite meeting in Dhaka on September 23 with leaders of the Bangladesh Road Transport Owners’ Association and the Bangladesh Road Transport Workers’ Federation. Bajlur Rahman Ratan, vice-president of Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners’ Association, told New Age, ‘We sat with the workers in Dhaka, raised their wages and allowances, and the meeting ended amicably. But now they are insisting on stopping buses anywhere on highways to pick up passengers and demanding additional daily food allowances.’ He said that as workers refused to run buses, the owners decided to suspend operations under such conditions. Rajshahi District Motor Workers’ Union general secretary Rafiqul Islam Pakhi, however, said that the owners had gone back on their promise. ‘In Tuesday’s meeting, they assured us that the wages and allowances provided by Ekota Paribahan would be introduced from Thursday. But when we went to them Thursday night, they refused to pay it and announced suspension of bus services,’ he said. On the issue of food allowance, he added, ‘A round-trip from Dhaka to Rajshahi takes about 24 hours. Ekota pays Tk 150 to each staff member as food allowance, but other owners refuse to pay it. That is the real reason behind the suspension.’ On September 7, workers had suspended bus services in the three districts over the wage issue, with operations resuming two days later after assurances from the owners. On September 22, they again launched an indefinite strike that lasted until the afternoon of September 23, with only Ekota buses running. Just a day after resumption, the services collapsed again, leaving thousands of passengers to suffer ahead of the upcoming Durga Puja holidays.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/277391/long-route-passengers-from-3-northern-dists-continue-to-suffer", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 492},

The Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division under the Ministry of Law issued a gazette late on Monday. The Council of Advisers approved the draft of the ordinance on November 6. According to the ordinance, tribunals will be set up at district and divisional levels to deal with the cases of prevention and prosecution of enforced disappearances. Offences under the ordinance are non-bailable and non-compoundable. As per the ordinance, if the victim dies as a result of enforced disappearance or if the person cannot be found alive or dead even five years after the disappearance, the offender may be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. If any public servant or member of a law enforcement agency arrests, detains, abducts, or otherwise deprives a person of liberty and deny the act or concealing the fate or whereabouts of the person, thereby placing the individual outside the protection of the law may face life imprisonment or a prison term of up to 10 years, it says. Anyone found to have destroyed evidence of disappearance, or constructed, installed, or used secret detention centres for enforced disappearances may face up to seven years in prison. The ordinance also sets out penalties for senior officers or commanders of law enforcement agencies. It states that if a superior officer orders, authorises, approves, consents to or instigates the commission of such crimes by subordinates or participates in the crime he or she will face the same punishment prescribed for the offence. A superior may also be punished if negligence, incompetence, or failure to maintain discipline or control enables subordinates to commit an enforced disappearance, the ordinance says. It further states that the location of an arrested person may be kept confidential ‘in the interest of state security’ until the person is produced before a magistrate. Trials may proceed in absentia if the accused is on the run.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/283944/bangladesh-promulgates-ordinance-establishing-death-penalty-for-enforced-disappearances", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 344},

Their return to safety brings an end to rescue efforts in the mountainous Chinese region, though the unexpected extreme conditions have wrought further damage in nearby areas. In the mountains of neighbouring Qinghai province, one hiker died from hypothermia and altitude sickness, state media reported Monday.

The festival is supported by the Government of Canada and jointly organised by Cartoon People, Bonhishikha – Unlearn Gender and Maa Er Doa Studio in partnership with the United Nations Women Bangladesh to challenge and prevent violence against women and girls in Bangladesh by using the wit and visual power of cartoons. Inaugurated on October 30, the festival consists of exhibitions, mural art, interactive installations, animation, video games, workshop, round table and live performances at the venue. ‘Cartoons for Equality’ features over 200 selected cartoons and comics from hundreds of submissions of professional and emerging cartoonists across Bangladesh while the artworks attempt to create public dialogue to reimagine narratives around gender equality. These single-image cartoons and comic strips depict how women and girls experience violence in everyday spaces — at home, workplaces and schools, in public, and in digital spaces. Rehnuma Proshoon’s cartoon titled ‘Orna Koi’ won the first prize among top 200 entries. The cartoon criticises bullying at workplaces by portraying that a Bangladeshi woman lands on the moon, while people of Bangladesh are asking her where her scarf is. Shamse Ara Naher Mohona, who won the second prize for her cartoon titled ‘Palm Up’, addresses violence against women at home. Junaid Iqbal Ishmam’s artwork titled ‘Internet Sharks’ shows violence and bullying against women and girls in digital space. The artwork won the third prize. Ramisa Nawar’s cartoon titled ‘Not about the Dress’ shows women and girls from all classes, races and religions are victims of violence. The event will also organise a ‘Cartoonists’ Round Table’ as part of the festival on November 7 at the exhibition venue while singer Warda Ashraf and cartoonist Rashad Imam Tanmoy with artists who were bullied online or directly targeted by digital mobs will share their experiences and recommendations regarding the issues.

{"title": "New UN report tackles ‘inequality-pandemic cycle’", "body": "High inequality makes the world vulnerable to pandemics and creates a vicious cycle that puts public health and economies at risk, leading economists, health experts and the United Nations said Monday. The findings were based on two years of research by the UNAIDS-convened Global Council on Inequality, AIDS and Pandemics and published in a report released ahead of meetings of G20 leaders in South Africa this month. ‘High levels of inequality, within and between countries, are making the world more vulnerable to pandemics, making pandemics more economically disruptive and deadly, and making them last longer,’ the report said. ‘Pandemics in turn increase inequality, driving the cyclical, self-reinforcing relationship,’ it said. The council that produced the report was led by experts including Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, former Namibia First Lady Monica Geingos and renowned epidemiologist Sir Michael Marmot. This ‘inequality-pandemic cycle’ could be seen in recent global public health crises such as Covid-19, AIDS, Ebola, influenza and mpox, they said in a statement. ‘Failure to tackle key inequalities and social determinants since Covid-19 has left the world extremely vulnerable to, and unprepared for, the next pandemic,’ it said. The Covid-19 pandemic in particular ‘pushed 165 million people into poverty while the world’s richest people increased their wealth by more than a quarter’, they said. Inequality ‘is a political choice, and a dangerous one that threatens everyone’s health’, Geingos said in a press release. The report called on world leaders to increase pandemic preparedness by investing in ‘social protection mechanisms’ within their countries while also tackling global inequality, including through debt restructuring for developing countries. ‘Pandemics are not only health crises; they are economic crises that can deepen inequality if leaders make the wrong policy choices,’ Stiglitz said. ‘When efforts to stabilise pandemic-hit economies are paid for through high-interest on debts and through austerity measures, they starve health, education and social protection systems,’ he said. This made societies less resilient and more vulnerable to disease outbreaks. ‘Breaking this cycle requires enabling all countries to have the fiscal space to invest in health security,’ Stiglitz said. The report also urged more equal access to treatments and health technology between richer and poorer countries, calling for increased funding for local and regional production and for an immediate waiver of intellectual property once a pandemic is declared. Stiglitz is also set to present a report on global inequality and poverty to world leaders ahead of the G20 summit on November 22 and 23.

{"title": "Reclaiming Bangladesh’s moral vision", "body": "IN BANGLADESH’S political terrain, there is a philosophical puzzle that would have bothered Greek philosopher, Aristotle: how does a country that was founded on the highest ideals of self-determination end up fighting against the loss of the very principles that made it possible? The question is not merely academic. When independence was declared in 1971, the political leaders invoked something deeper than territorial sovereignty — they summoned the moral imagination of a people who believed governance could be different, could be better. Yet 54 years later, we find ourselves asking: where did that moral vision go? Political polarisation in Bangladesh has transcended mere disagreement — it has become, in the Hegelian sense, a fundamental rupture in the dialectic of national consciousness. The Awami League and BNP don’t simply represent different policy positions; they embody competing narratives of what Bangladesh means, what it was, and what it should become. This is affective polarisation at its most corrosive. Citizens no longer see each other as fellow travellers on a shared journey towards national flourishing. Instead, we see enemies — threats to be neutralised rather than friendly neighbours with whom we must build a common future. The protests, the violence, the unwillingness to concede even obvious truths when they come from the ‘other side’ are symptoms of bad faith, a refusal to acknowledge our shared humanity because it threatens our constructed identities. When Tagore wrote ‘চিত্ত যেথা ভয়শূন্য, উচ্চ যেথা শির’ (‘Where the mind is without fear, the head is held high’), he was articulating a vision of Bangladesh (then Bengal) as a space of intellectual and moral freedom. Today, that freedom is constrained not by colonial masters but by our own tribal allegiances. We have imprisoned ourselves in Ibn Khaldun’s asabiyyah or group solidarity that, while providing strength, also breeds insularity and conflict. Bangladesh has rapidly adopted technology. From mobile banking to digital governance initiatives, we have leapt into the 21st century. Yet here lies a cruel irony that would fascinate the French sociologist, Jean Baudrillard: we have created an image of transparency with the appearance of openness without its substance. Social media in Bangladesh has become less a tool for truth-telling and more an instrument of what Michel Foucault would recognise as disciplinary power. Facebook posts are monitored, dissent is digitally tracked, and the same platforms that could democratise information instead amplify propaganda and misinformation. The Digital Security Act, ostensibly designed to protect citizens, became a modern panopticon, creating self-censorship through the mere possibility of surveillance. Meanwhile, traditional media operates under constraints both subtle and overt. When journalists practise self-censorship, knowing which stories will bring consequences, we witness the predictability of evil: not dramatic acts of oppression, but the quiet, bureaucratic erosion of truth-telling. The classical Islamic scholars referred to amanah (trustworthiness) as a sacred obligation. We lose not only facts but also our ability to think morally as a group when information itself becomes untrustworthy and we can’t tell the difference between truth and manipulation. How can we practise shura (consultation) when we can’t trust what we are talking about? If corruption in Bangladesh is considered as a legal or economic issue, we are missing its deeper philosophical aspects. When a citizen has to pay a bribe to register land that is rightfully theirs, or when contracts go to people who are politically connected instead of people who are good at what they do, we are seeing more than theft; we are seeing the negation of the social contract itself. The French thinker, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argued that legitimate authority derives from the general will or the collective interest of the people. But when institutions serve private interests disguised as public policy, when the state becomes an instrument for wealth extraction rather than public service, we face a legitimacy crisis. The government may have power, but it lacks moral authority. Think about the scandals in the banking industry, where billions of dollars disappear and enter foreign accounts while common citizens struggle. This isn’t just an economic crime; it’s a betrayal of trust that makes it impossible for adl (justice) to occur. Adl is such an important idea in Islamic political philosophy that the Quran mentions it several times. Persian scholar, Al-Ghazali, wrote that a ruler who steals from the treasury steals not just from people’s pockets but from their hearts and destroys the spiritual bond between the governed and the governor. When corruption becomes systematic and exploitative, it becomes so normalised that people cease to imagine alternatives. The German sociologist, Max Weber warned that bureaucracy, while necessary for modern governance, risks becoming an ‘iron cage’ that traps both officials and citizens in meaningless rituals. Bangladesh has realised Weber’s nightmare. To get a simple document certified, one must navigate a Byzantine system of signatures, stamps and ‘speed money.’ The bureaucracy doesn’t serve efficiency; it creates opportunities for rent-seeking. Every unnecessary step is a toll booth, every delay a negotiation. Yet here’s the deeper problem: this system infantilises citizens. It creates the belief that one cannot navigate official channels without connections or cash. This is antithetical to the republican ideal of the active, empowered citizen — the nagorik who participates in governance as a right, not a client begging for favours. The great German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, argued that enlightenment means humanity’s emergence from ‘self-incurred immaturity.’ Our bureaucratic culture enforces immaturity, treating citizens as children to be managed rather than as autonomous moral agents with rights and dignity. American sociologist, Putnam’s ‘Bowling Alone’ thesis finds tragic resonance in Bangladesh. We were once a nation of samaj — vibrant community organisations, neighbourhood associations, cultural societies that formed the sinews of civil society. These spaces weren’t just social; they were schools of democracy where people learned to deliberate, compromise and act collectively. These places are now disappearing. In Dhaka or elsewhere, young people are more likely to scroll through Facebook than attend community meetings. The village salish, even though it had its problems, at least made it possible for people to settle their differences. Now, these are replaced by either court systems that are too expensive for most people or political intermediaries who dispense ’justice’ based on party loyalty. This civic atrophy has profound implications. As French philosopher, Tocqueville observed, intermediate associations between the individual and the state are essential for democracy. They are where we practise the habits of citizenship — learning to see beyond our immediate interests, to compromise, to take responsibility for collective outcomes. The Bengali philosophical tradition, from Rammohan Roy to Lalon Fakir, emphasised manusher jonno manush — humans for humans. But this requires spaces where we encounter each other as humans, not as partisan categories. Without civic engagement, we lose the empathetic imagination necessary for democratic life. We need to move from a ‘politics as war’ model to some kind of pluralism where opponents are adversaries to be argued with, not enemies to be destroyed. This would require, first of all, constitutional reform that limits executive power and creates genuine checks and balances, preventing winner-take-all politics. Secondly, electoral reforms, including relational representation to force coalition-building and moderation. Thirdly, parliamentary strengthening for debates and discussions to become consequential, not theatrical. Last but not least, civil society dialogues convened by trusted neutral institutions (perhaps universities or cultural organisations) where cross-party conversations can occur. But institutionally, we need a cultural shift — recovering the Islamic tradition of ikhtilaf (respectful disagreement) and the Bengali tradition of adda (open-ended, generous conversation). Political differences should be normalised, even celebrated, as necessary for collective wisdom. We need to build a public sphere worthy of truth by recovering the enlightenment ideal of the public sphere — a space where citizens can reason together, test claims against evidence and form considered opinions. The classical Islamic concept of adab (etiquette) or proper conduct and refinement of character, should be recovered as central to leadership. Similarly, the Bengali bhadralok tradition, at its best, emphasised education, culture and service over mere wealth or power. The German Marxist philosopher, Ernst Bloch, argued that hope is not naive optimism but an active principle — a commitment to actualising unrealised possibilities. Bangladesh carries within it the genetic memory of 1971, when ordinary people chose courage over convenience, when students, farmers and intellectuals united around a moral vision of self-determination and dignity. That spirit isn’t dead; it’s dormant. The task of recovering ethical leadership is ultimately about reawakening our collective capacity to imagine and build a better political community. It requires what the Sufis call tawbah (repentance) not just apology, but fundamental turning, a change of heart and direction. We must choose to see politics not as a zero-sum game of power accumulation but as the art of living together well — the highest human calling, as Aristotle emphasised. We must rebuild trust not through naive faith but through consistent, reciprocal actions that demonstrate trustworthiness. We must engage not because it’s easy but because disengagement guarantees that the worst among us will make decisions for all of us. The great Bengali poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote, ‘Jatir porichoy noy, manusher porichoy chai’ (I don’t seek identity as nations, I seek identity as humans). Perhaps that’s where we begin: by recovering our common humanity beneath our political identities, by remembering that we share not just a territory but a destiny, and by accepting that the quality of that destiny depends on choices we make today. The river still flows to the sea. The question is whether we will build bridges over it or drown in its currents.

It added that the allegations and related information, including photos of controversial activities during the previous regime, sparked resentment among students and cultural activists who took part in the 2024 mass uprising. To avoid unwanted incidents, the event was suspended immediately, it said.

{"title": "Climate resilience through participation", "body": "CLIMATE change is not only an environmental or scientific problem; it is, at its heart, a social, ethical and political challenge. Dr Chloe Lucas, an environmental social scientist at the University of Tasmania, explores this complexity through her pioneering project, ‘Helping Citizens Share Responsibility for Democratic Climate Adaptation,’ Funded by the Australian Research Council under its Discovery Early Career Researcher Award scheme, Lucas’s work examines how democratic processes and civic participation can help societies adapt to climate change in fairer and more effective ways. At a time when climate responses often come from the top down, led by experts and policymakers, Lucas offers a fresh and transformative approach. She invites ordinary citizens to become active participants in shaping their shared future. At the core of her research lies a simple but profound question: how can societies share the responsibility of adapting to climate change in ways that are democratic, inclusive, and rooted in lived experience? Traditional models of climate governance often assume that the public lacks the expertise to contribute meaningfully. As a result, solutions are frequently imposed from above, overlooking the local realities, values and capacities that truly define resilience. Lucas challenges this assumption. She begins instead from the belief that adaptation will not succeed unless it draws upon the knowledge, creativity and moral insight of ordinary people. To explore this, her project uses innovative tools such as game-based deliberation and participatory simulations. In these interactive exercises, participants take on roles — as citizens, policymakers, or community leaders — and navigate complex climate dilemmas together. They negotiate trade-offs, allocate resources and face uncertainty in a shared, experimental space. What might have been abstract policy debates become vivid, emotional and deeply human experiences. Lucas’s use of play and simulation reflects her conviction that climate adaptation is as much a cultural process as a scientific one. Play fosters creativity and empathy; it breaks down barriers between experts and citizens and encourages people to see issues through one another’s eyes. Her research shows that, through these participatory experiences, people begin to view themselves not as passive recipients of government policy but as co-creators of resilience. This shift, from dependence to shared responsibility, lies at the heart of democratic climate governance. Her participatory model also highlights a crucial truth: climate adaptation is deeply political. Policies that aim to protect society often distribute their costs and benefits unevenly. Marginalised communities, already vulnerable, are too often asked to bear the heaviest burdens. By engaging participants from diverse backgrounds — across age, gender, income and geography — Lucas’s project shines a light on these inequalities. It exposes how history, economics and trust in institutions shape people’s experience of climate vulnerability. In Lucas’s view, democratic adaptation must be both inclusive and reflexive, always asking who gets to speak, who gets to decide and who stands to gain. Australia provides a telling backdrop for her research. The country’s climate debates have long been polarised, with adaptation efforts split between local, state and federal levels. Lucas situates her work in this contested landscape, arguing that democratic participation can bridge the gap between policy frameworks and the realities of everyday life. Yet her insights travel far beyond Australia, resonating strongly with developing nations like Bangladesh, where climate vulnerability is not only physical but deeply social. Bangladesh, among the most climate-affected countries in the world, faces a dual challenge: strengthening technical adaptation measures like flood control and cyclone preparedness while also building community-based resilience. Here, Lucas’s approach offers a crucial lesson, adaptation that excludes public participation risks worsening inequalities and eroding trust. The idea of shared responsibility feels particularly relevant in Bangladesh, where grassroots mobilisation and collective action have long shaped disaster response. A democratic approach to adaptation could build on these traditions, empowering citizens to help shape the policies that safeguard their lives and livelihoods. Lucas’s thinking is grounded in environmental sociology and democratic theory. She sees adaptation as a collective moral practice, a way for societies to negotiate their obligations to one another and to future generations. Her work challenges the technocratic belief that climate change can be solved by experts alone. Instead, she draws on the principles of deliberative democracy, echoing scholars such as John Dryzek, Elinor Ostrom and Sheila Jasanoff, who champion shared governance and co-produced knowledge. One of Lucas’s most original contributions is her focus on the emotional and relational side of adaptation. She argues that people’s willingness to take responsibility is shaped not just by logic or data but by feelings — empathy, trust, fear and hope. By creating spaces where these emotions can be expressed and shared, participatory games build the foundations of social cohesion. This challenges the idea that public engagement should be purely informational. Instead, it shows that belonging, fairness and a sense of agency are essential ingredients of democratic resilience. From a policy perspective, Lucas’s work offers practical guidance for governments seeking to involve the public more meaningfully. Her findings suggest that when participatory mechanisms are designed with sensitivity to local culture and capacity, they can make adaptation both more effective and legitimate. Policymakers, she argues, should not see citizens as obstacles but as essential partners, people who can help identify priorities, test ideas and hold institutions accountable. Shared ownership of the process, she notes, is what sustains adaptation over time. Her work also prompts a deeper reflection: what does democracy mean in an age of ecological crisis? Some argue that the urgency of climate change demands swift, centralised action. Lucas disagrees. She shows that participation and speed can coexist, that well-designed democratic processes can, in fact, produce consensus and action faster than authoritarian ones, precisely because they build trust. In this way, democracy itself becomes a form of resilience: a living system that learns and adapts through dialogue. Seen in full, ‘Helping Citizens Share Responsibility for Democratic Climate Adaptation’ weaves together empirical research and ethical reflection. It bridges sociology, political science, and psychology to illuminate how social values and democratic institutions respond under pressure. Its innovative use of games, as both research and learning tools, offers a model that others can adapt around the world. By making climate decisions visible and experiential, Lucas transforms abstract governance into shared understanding. Her broader work on climate communication complements this project. She has examined how people interpret environmental messages differently, depending on their cultural identities and levels of trust in authority. Lucas argues that storytelling, trust and emotion often move people more deeply than facts alone, a crucial insight for anyone trying to inspire collective climate action. For countries like Bangladesh, where adaptation is not just policy but a moral necessity, Lucas’s ideas open up a new path. Her approach could inspire community simulations, citizen assemblies, or participatory planning games to deliberate over issues such as land use, migration, and resource management. By giving people a direct voice in shaping their own adaptation strategies, such initiatives could make those strategies more just, more durable, and more humane. Ultimately, Dr Chloe Lucas’s work redefines what it means to adapt to climate change in democratic societies. She invites us to see responsibility not as a burden handed down from above, but as a shared commitment, built through empathy, dialogue and imagination. At a time when trust in institutions is fragile and climate politics are bitterly divided, her research offers a message of hope: that democracy itself can be an instrument of resilience. When adaptation is pursued collectively, it becomes more than mere survival, it becomes an act of solidarity and shared humanity. For Bangladesh, and indeed, for the world, this vision of democratic adaptation provides both a moral compass and a practical roadmap for navigating the uncertainties of a changing planet.

Also the spokesperson of the Inquilab Mancha, Hadi was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in a critical condition and later shifted to Evercare Hospital in the evening. The incident took place a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the 13th JS elections and the national referendum on February 12, 2026. Interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus and different political parties, including Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, National Citizen Party, Amar Bangladesh Party, Rashtra Sangskar Andolan, Islami Andolan Bangladesh, Ganosamhati Andolon, and Bangladesh Revolutionary Workers Party expressed deep concern over the shooting. The chief adviser asked the authorities concerned to bring the perpetrators under the law soon while political leaders demanded of the government to arrest the shooters immediately. DMCH neurosurgery departmental head Professor Zahid Raihan said that Hadi was in a critical condition as a bullet pierced through the head from the upper side of the left ear and damaged a portion of his brain. ‘We cannot offer any hopeful words to you, but he is still alive,’ said the doctor. Hadi was shot in the head in Box Culvert area of Bijoynagar while he was out for election campaign, said Israfil Farazi, who works with Hadi. He said that Hadi carried out electoral campaign in Motijheel, offered his Jumma prayers at a mosque and was returning from the mosque by an auto-rickshaw in the afternoon. Israfil alleged that two assailants on a motorcycle shot Hadi when he was on the running auto-rickshaw and fled the scene immediately. He suspected that two unknown individuals who took part in Hadi’s electoral campaign for the past few days wearing face masks and also on the day of the incident were involved in the shooting. CCTV footage of the area showed that Hadi was heading towards Bijoynagar on an auto-rickshaw when the two men wearing helmet on a motorcycle opened fire on him at about 2:30pm on the Box Culvert road before fleeing the scene. The area was later cordoned off as members of law enforcement agencies, including police, Rapid Action Battalion and Detective Branch, began investigating the incident. Hadi was rushed to the DMCH emergency department where he was first operated upon and later shifted to Evercare Hospital at about 7:30pm. Dhaka Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner for media and public relations Muhammad Talebur Rahman said that the police have collected CCTV footage from the area and were analysing those to identify and arrest the perpetrators. The police, along with the Detective Branch, were conducting search operations at suspected places and examining persons to arrest the assailants. Law enforcers, including army personnel, struggle to handle a crowd of hundreds of social media activists and youtubers outside the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital after bringing bullet-hit Sharif Osman Hadi, an aspiring candidate for the Dhaka 8 parliamentary constituency, to the health facility in the capital on Friday. — Sony Ramani Thousands of people gathered on the DMCH premises after he was taken to the emergency department there. Additional police and army personnel were deployed there at about 3:30pm to control the crowd and maintain the law and order. Leaders of different political parties, including BNP-nominated Dhaka-8 constituency candidate Mirza Abbas and NCP leaders Nahid Islam, Hasnat Abdullah, Nasiruddin Patwary and Tasnim Jara, among others, visited the hospital to visit Hadi in the afternoon. Inqilab Mancha activists, however, barred Mirza Abbas from visiting the bullet-injured Hadi. As Mirza Abbas attempted to enter, several agitated Inquilab Mancha activists rushed toward him, prompting army personnel present there to escort him inside safely. He left the hospital at about 4:30pm. Inquilab Mancha activist and Dhaka University Central Students’ Union secretary Fatima Tasnim Zuma alleged that Mirza Abbas was involved in the shooting incident. Hadi is considered a leading face in the July uprising, which led the fall of Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League regime on August 5, 2024. From the Inquilab Mancha, Hadi led major programmes, including long march towards Dumboor Dam in India, demanding fair share of trans-boundary rivers, demanding a national day on the death anniversary of Abrar Fahad, and supporting martyr and wounded families during the July uprising. Earlier, the BNP’s primarily selected candidate for the Chattogram-8 constituency, Ershad Ullah, was shot and injured by miscreants during his election campaign in the port city on November 5.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/284960/shot-in-head-critically-wounded-hadi-undergoing-treatment-at-evercare-hospital", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 756},

Farzana Haque starred with a half-century to help Barishal post 137-3 in 20 overs, while the bowlers restricted Rangpur to 124-9 in the allotted overs after a disciplined bowling effort. Barishal secured 12 points with six wins in seven matches to finish at the top of the table in the eight-team tournament. Following them, Khulna placed second with 10 points, and Chattogram, with the same points but a lower run-rate, took third place, while Rangpur finished fourth with eight points. Opting to bat first, openers Farzana and Sumi Akter (47 off 45) laid a solid foundation with a 78-run partnership for Barishal. Sumi missed out on her fifty by three runs as Farzana 51 off 52 balls with five boundaries and two sixes, guided their team to a respectable total. Chasing the target, Rangpur faltered early, but Nepa Akter’s 31, along with late contributions from Lucky Khatun (32) and Tomalika Sumona (24), kept them in contention, though the bowlers ensured Barishal’s victory.

{"title": "Poor funding handicaps research at public univs", "body": "The country’s public universities receive inadequate funds for research purposes, which extremely limits the number and quality of their research. To make things worse, the universities often fail to utilise fully the funds they get for conducting research due to mismanagement. Academics and researchers said that conducting research was crucial for the universities to have insights into different essential areas of knowledge, benefitting the students as well as society. But the standard of most of the research conducted by the country’s public universities using low amounts of fund was below par and failed to play any significant role in society, they said. Though the government fund for conducting research at these universities has risen over the years, the amount still remains scanty, they said. For their poor performances in the area of research, the country’s 56 public universities lag behind in different international rankings on the standards of the universities. The country’s 116 private universities, however, do not get any government grant for conducting research, said officials of the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh’s research grants and awards division. Professor SMA Faiz, chairman of the UGC, said that the universities could not improve without conducting research. ‘The budget allocation for research at the public universities is very low and insufficient. The fund should be increased significantly,’ he said. Fahmida Khatun, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a civil society think tank in Bangladesh, said that the country’s public universities were placed lower positions in different global rankings as the number of research done by these universities was low in terms of the international standard. The UGC’s annual reports for 2023, 2022 and 2021 showed that the revised budget for research for the universities was Tk 121.05 crore in the 2022-2023 financial year, Tk 100.79 crore in FY 2021-22 and Tk 75.39 crore in FY 2020-2021. In FY 2023-24, the allocation for the sector was Tk 144 crore and in FY 2024-25, it was Tk 188.65 crore. In FY 2014-2015, the allocation for the sector was Tk 2.87 crore. Against the allocations, the available data in these reports showed, the actual expenditure of the fund for research sector was Tk 103.2 crore in FY 2022-23, Tk 85.82 crore in FY 2021-22, Tk 53.54 crore in FY 2020-21 and Tk 2.84 crore in FY 2014-15. Professor Imran Rahman, vice-chancellor of the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh, said that the overall number of research papers in Bangladesh was very low and these were not of international standards. The research grants given by the government to Dhaka University is very insufficient, said Imran, who had been a faculty at the Institute of Business Administration at Dhaka University for 23 years. ‘The private universities do not get research fund from the government,’ he said. Professor Md Fazlur Rahman, a teacher at the DU Institute of Education and Research, said that some funds for research remained unused due to bureaucratic complexities as for having these funds the researchers had to take permissions from several authorities. Researchers do not get a sufficient amount of money to conduct a large-scale national-level research, he said. He mentioned that a research project got maximum Tk 10 lakh that forced researchers to conduct research on small-scale samples or areas with insufficient workforces. ‘That is why most of the research are useless,’ he said. Professor Fazlur, also served as a representative of teachers to the Dhaka University’s senate between 2017 and 2020, said that in these years no allocation was given to the Institute of Education and Research for research purposes. Another professor from the same institute alleged that during the previous governments’ tenures, political affiliation was considered while allocating research fund for teachers. ‘Many eligible teachers connected to opposition political camps did not get the fund,’ he said, adding that as some teachers who were not qualified enough could not use the funds entirely and the funds remained underutilised. Some public university vice-chancellors shared what types of research were conducted at their universities. At Kurigram Agricultural University, academic activities started in February 2025 while the university did not get any funds for research in FY 2024-25 and FY 2025-26, said the university vice-chancellor, professor Md Rashedul Islam. He said that the university teachers had already submitted some research proposals. ‘Research is essential for universities and without research no university becomes complete,’ Rashedul said, adding that they requested UGC officials to allocate some funds for research. Rangamati Science and Technology University vice-chancellor professor Md Atiar Rahman said that under the university, research was conducted by the teachers only at the departments of computer science and engineering, management, tourism and hospitality management and forestry and environmental science. The teachers got Tk 2 lakh to Tk 3 lakh for each research, he mentioned. Fahmida Khatun also said that the authorities of public universities might say that they got poor funds for research, but it needed to be monitored if the allocated funds were being used properly. The government should also monitor the quality of the research done by public universities, she added. Professor Imran Rahman said that at ULAB there were three research centres and in the past one decade, they were conducting multi-country research by getting international grants competitively. Some other private universities are also conducting good research, he mentioned. ‘In Bangladesh, there is only a handful of actual university- or department- based research, which is not good,’ he said, adding, ‘if we do not conduct research, we will continue to depend on foreign books or knowledge.’ In response to a question, professor SMA Faiz said that he could not make comments on unused funds for research at the public universities as he joined the UGC in 2024. The commission is trying to contribute to the research sector by ensuring transparency and accountability under the higher education acceleration and transformation project, he added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/278899/poor-funding-handicaps-research-at-public-univs", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 972},
{"title": "Powerful Christmas storms soak Southern California", "body": "Flash flood warnings were in effect in Los Angeles and most of southern California on Wednesday as one of the worst Christmas storms in recent memory brought heavy rain and fears of deadly mudslides. Driven by an atmospheric river known as ‘the Pineapple Express,’ which moves heavy moisture from the tropical climes of Hawaii to rain on the West Coast, the storm is expected to deliver months’ worth of rain over the next few days. California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in several counties, including Los Angeles, to facilitate the rapid mobilization and allocation of resources if needed. ‘Life-threatening flash flooding continues over Southern California today and tomorrow; heavy mountain snow and high winds also ongoing,’ the National Weather Service said, adding that ‘lives and property are in great danger.’ The first burst of heavy rain hit the region Tuesday night, leaving Los Angeles with fallen trees and some debris in the streets, as well as minor flooding that hampered traffic. The rainfall intensified early Wednesday, leaving thousands of people in southern California without power due to downed lines caused by the fury of the Christmas storm. Late Wednesday the first storm moved out of the Los Angeles area, ‘but another storm is expected to move in later tonight into Christmas Day,’ weather officials warned. Some communities already received 10 inches of rain in the first storm, forecasters said. Across the state, some 80,000 homes and businesses had no electricity heading into Christmas Eve, according to tracking site Poweroutage.us. Fire burn scars and the communities near them across the state are under special alert, including the coastal areas of Pacific Palisades and Malibu, as they are still recovering from the devastating wildfires in January. Due to fire damage, the terrain is susceptible to mudslides from heavy rain. While many were still hoping to drive to spend the holidays with family, transportation officials were busy announcing road and freeway closures due to flooding, fallen trees and mud flows across Southern California. The Red Cross opened shelters in several communities as some residents in Southern California received immediate evacuation orders. Authorities were responding to a series of accidents Wednesday, and several major roads were closed due to flash flood warnings. Ariel Cohen, an NWS meteorologist, warned that from Wednesday afternoon through Friday, ‘many areas will likely experience significant flooding, along with rockslides and mudslides, especially in the higher elevations.’ ‘If you were planning to travel on the roads during Christmas, please reconsider your plans,’ he added. However, many Angelenos were still out and about Wednesday, buying last-minute gifts, grocery shopping, even jogging. For some though, Christmas travel was upended. ‘We decided to stay home,’ said Jim Lewis, who opted against going to his cousins in nearby Pasadena and was doing last-minute shopping in the city instead. ‘We’ve been receiving all these alerts, it doesn’t feel safe, I don’t feel like driving there at dark,’ he told AFP. Larissa Peet, who was planning a party, said her celebration was still on. ‘Nothing that we’re doing differently. Just hanging out, eating, drinking and having a good time,’ she said.

The deceased, identified as Md Jahid aged between 20 and 25 years, was a resident of the Geneva Camp, said the police. Mohammadpur police station officer-in-charge Kazi Rafiq Ahmed told New Age that the incident occurred at about 3:40am inside the camp. Initial information suggested that Jahid suffered serious injuries in a cocktail explosion during a clash between two groups inside the camp, he said. Quoting witnesses, the police official said, ‘A violent altercation broke out between two groups inside the camp early Thursday. When Jahid stepped out of his house during the clash, a cocktail exploded, leaving him critically injured.’ Filing a case regarding the incident was under way, he added. Jahid’s relative Robin Hossain said that Jahid walked a short distance from his house during the clash to see what was happening when a cocktail exploded and struck him on his head. ‘We first took Jahid to a nearby medical facility and later he was transferred to the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where the on-duty doctors declared him dead at about 4:30am,’ he said.

{"title": "West Indies 110-0, trail by 465, after Conway's epic 227 for New Zealand", "body": "Brandon King and John Campbell comfortably negotiated 23 overs in fading light before stumps to take the West Indies to 110-0 at the end of day two of the third Test after New Zealand declared on a mammoth 575-8 at Mount Maunganui. The West Indies, with King unbeaten on 55 and Campbell not out 45, are still 465 runs behind. New Zealand opener Devon Conway's epic 227 and some late hitting from Rachin Ravindra, who had six fours and two sixes in his 72 not out, and Ajaz Patel (30 not out) allowed captain Tom Latham to give his bowlers more than an hour at the West Indies openers. But King and Campbell were more than up to the task, seeing off the new ball and scoring freely on a flat Bay Oval wicket as New Zealand's bowlers struggled to find a good length. King's 50 came from just 62 balls, hitting nine fours and Campbell's 45 was made from 60 deliveries, and included seven fours. Campbell was nursing a sore right-hand that was struck in the nets prior to the match. If the injury-depleted West Indies had any other options, he may have sat out the Test such was the swelling and pain he was experiencing. The visitors also have doubts over whether Kemar Roach, who is nursing a hamstring strain, will bat, while leading batsman Shai Hope was ill and stayed at the team hotel Friday. West Indies all-rounder Justin Greaves said it had been a good day for his side, particularly given the adversity they faced. ‘After the day we had yesterday, actually to come today and get eight wickets, it's a really, really good effort from our boys,’ Greaves said. ‘Especially with Kemar Roach being down for us as well, everyone had to put in a pretty big shift today, so I'm very happy for us.’ Three West Indian bowlers took two wickets each, Justin Greaves the pick with 2-83 from 29 overs, while Jayden Seales had 2-100 and Anderson Phillip 2-154. The battered West Indian bowling corps did show some fight after lunch, led by a sharp and accurate spell from Seales. He trapped Conway lbw to make it 432-4 and the West Indies removed two more batsmen as New Zealand went to tea at 508-6. Glenn Phillips lost his battle with Phillip after tea, edging to first slip, and Zak Foulkes was bowled by a peach of a ball clipping the top of off stump. Recalled spinner Patel lofted two sixes in the final over before the declaration in his 30 from 30 balls. ‘We're pretty pretty chipper with that,’ Ravindra said of the team batting performance. ‘Dev's knock was incredible, and I think the way him and Tommy set the tone... obviously when you get the chance to declare in your first innings on that total, it's a hell of an effort.’ New Zealand had resumed after lunch at 424-3 at lunch, looking to punish an under-strength West Indian attack missing Roach. The tourists did not help themselves in the field. Kavem Hodge dropped Conway when he was on 206, and Daryl Mitchell was shelled by Greaves at second slip when he was on nine. Seales was first to strike in the afternoon, darting one past the inside edge of Conway and into the pads, a ball that would have clattered into middle and leg stumps. Conway's three runs after lunch saw him go past the top score of his batting idol, Neil McKenzie, who made 226 for South Africa against Bangladesh in 2008. Mitchell fell for 11, getting a thick edge down the legside from Roston Chase taken by wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach who also accounted for Tom Blundell off Seales. Earlier, Conway resumed on 178 and brought up his second Test double-century -- his first since his debut in 2021 against England at Lord's -- when he cut a Seales short ball to the point boundary. His 200 came off 316 balls, with 28 fours. Greaves then struck to remove Williamson just before lunch for 31, caught by Imlach.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/285567/west-indies-110-0-trail-by-465-after-conways-epic-227-for-new-zealand", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 677},
{"title": "Strange ‘rogue’ planet spotted guzzling matter like a star", "body": "A mysterious ‘rogue’ planet has been observed gobbling six billion tonnes of gas and dust a second — an unprecedented rate that blurs the line between planets and stars, astronomers said Thursday. Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system which orbit the Sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star. Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone — but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night. These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are ‘neither a star nor a proper planet,’ Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland’s University of St Andrews and co-author of a new study, said. ‘Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?’ The team of researchers behind the new study were stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon. The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter. Scholz explained that the object is ‘still in its infancy,’ being roughly one or two million years old. The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it — a process called accretion. But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 ‘blurs the line between stars and planets,’ study-co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement. In August last year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking six-billion-tonnes per second — eight times faster than a few months earlier. ‘This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,’ said lead study Victor Almendros-Abad of the Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Italy. By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object. This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars. The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand. This is also something that has previously been observed in stars — but never for a forming planet. Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies ‘that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like new-born stars’. No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size. Scholz said that unlike stars, this object is ‘not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core’. So, like other planets, ‘it will cool inevitably as it gets older,’ he added. Amelia Bayo, another co-author of the study in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said ‘the idea that a planetary object can behave like a star is awe-inspiring’. It ‘invites us to wonder what worlds beyond our own could be like during their nascent stages,’ she added. The observations were made by the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, and included data from the James Webb Space Telescope.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/space/277887/strange-rogue-planet-spotted-guzzling-matter-like-a-star", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 541},

The services were suspended on the Shahbagh-Agargaon section from 9:15pm to 10:30pm on Wednesday as trains were facing jerks at the Farmgate point. Md Ahsan Ullah Sharifi, deputy project director (public relations) of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited, the implementing agency of the metro rail system, said that metro trains had started to run on their usual schedule since Thursday morning. Retired Brigadier General Md Abdul Wohab, director of the Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development Project (Line-6), told New Age that due to issues related to the operations of trains near the location where recently a bearing pad had fallen, metro rail services had been suspended on Wednesday night. At about 9:15pm on Wednesday, jerking on the track between the Farmgate and Agargaon sections led to the suspension, said Sharifi. However, trains on the Agargaon-Uttara and Motijheel-Shahbagh sections ran as per the usual schedule on Wednesday night, officials added. Due to the disruption in services, passengers suffered immensely on Wednesday night as many could not reach their destinations by the metro trains. Earlier, on October 26, metro rail services remained halted for 23 hours on the Shahbagh-Bijoy Sarani section following a fatal incident involving the death of a pedestrian who was struck by a bearing pad that had fallen from a metro pier. Services resumed on the Uttara-Agargaon section after two and a half hours, and on the Motijheel-Shahbagh section after seven hours on that day. The location where the bearing pad fell on October 26, Pier 433, is near the entrance of the Farmgate metro station. This incident follows a similar occurrence in 2024, when a bearing pad fell from Pier 430. A probe committee formed by the road transport and bridges ministry in this connection is working to submit a report within two weeks from the accident. In a press release issued on Wednesday, the DMTCL reassured passengers about the safety of its services. It said that all metro trains were being operated in compliance with safety rules and regulations while passengers were requested not to be concerned about safety.

{"title": "Israel denies hostage find", "body": "Israel said on Saturday that three bodies it received from Gaza the night before were not hostages held in the Palestinian territory, as a Hamas security source reported fresh strikes in the south. Despite occasional flare-ups, a fragile truce has been holding in Gaza since October 10, based on a US-brokered deal centred on the return of all Israeli hostages, both living and dead. Israel’s military told AFP that a forensic analysis revealed that three bodies it received via the Red Cross on Friday were not those of any of the deceased captives still to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal. Hamas’s armed wing said Saturday that it had handed over bodies it had not positively identified, alleging Israel had declined its offer to provide samples for testing and ‘demanded the bodies for examination’. ‘We handed them over to preempt any enemy claims,’ the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades said. Meanwhile, Jordan and Germany said that an international force expected to support a future Palestinian police in Gaza under US president Donald Trump’s post-war governance plan should have a UN mandate. ‘We all agree that in order for that stabilisation force to be able to be effective in getting the job done, it has to have a Security Council mandate,’ Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said. Jordan, however, will not be sending its own forces to the Strip. Safadi was speaking at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain alongside his German counterpart Johann Wadephul, who also supported a UN mandate for the force, saying it would ‘need a clear basis in international law’. ‘We understand that this is of utmost importance to those countries who might be willing to send troops to Gaza and for the Palestinians. Germany would also want to see a clear mandate for this mission,’ Wadephul said. After the start of the truce, Hamas returned the 20 surviving hostages still in its custody and began the process of returning the remains of the dead. Of the 17 bodies returned since the start of the ceasefire, 15 were Israelis, one was Thai and one was Nepalese. Hamas has also returned another unidentified body that had not been listed among the 28 missing, as well as the partial remains of a deceased Israeli hostage who had already been recovered early in the war. In its statement Saturday, the Al-Qassam Brigades called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide the ‘necessary equipment and personnel to work on recovering all the bodies simultaneously’. Hamas and Israel, meanwhile, have traded accusations of breaking the ceasefire. A Hamas security source told AFP on Saturday that Israel had carried out several air strikes in the south at dawn, and that ‘warships opened fire toward the shores of Khan Yunis’. Earlier in the week, the Israeli military launched its deadliest night of bombing since the truce after one of its soldiers was killed in south Gaza, with the territory’s civil defence agency reporting more than 100 people killed. Hamas denied it had anything to do with the attack, and Israel later said it had begun ‘renewed enforcement of the ceasefire’. The implementation of the later stages of Trump’s ceasefire plan has yet to be agreed, particularly as it concerns disarming Hamas, establishing a transitional authority and deploying an international stabilisation force. The force is expected to be drawn from a coalition of mainly Arab and Muslim nations, and would train and support vetted Palestinian police with backing from Egypt and Jordan as well as secure border areas and prevent weapons smuggling. The idea of the stabilisation force has drawn some criticism, with UN experts last month warning it would ‘replace Israeli occupation with a US-led occupation, contrary to Palestinian self-determination’. The UN has mandated international peacekeeping forces in the region for decades, including UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, which is currently working with the Lebanese army to enforce a November 2024 ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/280873/israel-denies-hostage-find", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 654},

Since breaking out in April 2023, the war between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced nearly 12 million and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. ‘We see a situation where more than 30 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. That is half of the population of Sudan,’ Danish Refugee Council secretary general Charlotte Slente told AFP by phone this week after a visit to a border region in neighbouring Chad. ‘The suffering we see is unimaginable.’ Sudan had a population of around 50 million people in 2024, according to the World Bank. The aid official’s comments came after a field visit to an area in Chad that borders Sudan’s western Darfur region, which has seen fierce fighting of late. Violence has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with the RSF seizing control of the key town of El-Fasher—the army’s last stronghold in Darfur—after an 18-month siege and reports of atrocities multiplying. ‘There are violations that cross all international humanitarian laws,’ she added. Slente said the NGO had seen evidence of mass killings and sexual violence in Sudan. ‘We see detentions, we see abductions, forced displacement and torture,’ she said.

{"title": "Gold demand hit records as price soared: industry data", "body": "Demand for gold hit a record high in the third quarter as the precious metal’s price hit all-time highs on geopolitical unrest, industry data showed Thursday. Total demand grew three per cent year-on-year in the July-September period to 1,313 tonnes, the World Gold Council said, as the metal perceived as a safe haven investment benefitted from the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Gaza conflict. That was the highest level of demand by volume since the WGC began compiling such records around 25 years ago. ‘Various regional conflicts, the increasing rhetoric around trade conflicts, all of that combines really to just create this atmosphere of heightened uncertainty’ and boost demand for gold, WGC analyst Louise Street told AFP. A surge in buying, driven by central banks, coincided with gold’s price striking record after record this year. However since the metal struck an all-time peak in October of $4,381.52 an ounce, it has fallen heavily on profit taking. Gold demand by value surged 44 per cent year-on-year to a record $146 billion in the third quarter, the WGC added in its report. The US government shutdown and expectations of more cuts to Federal Reserve interest rates, which is weighing on the dollar, have lent additional support to gold’s price in recent months according to analysts. There has been strong demand for gold via Exchange-Traded Funds on stock markets. ETFs allow investment without trading on the gold futures market. The high-price environment has, however, dampened jewellery demand, according to the WGC.

{"title": "Nurses deserve more than gratitude", "body": "THE global discourse, as highlighted by the International Labour Organisation, has rightly recognised the ‘care economy’ as a vital pillar for the future of decent work. This economy, spanning both paid and unpaid labour, from a nurse in a hospital ward to a family member tending to an elder, is facing a worldwide crisis of recognition, resources and rights. For a country like Bangladesh, with a population exceeding 168 million, this global concern is far from abstract; it is an immediate, lived reality. The nation’s aspiration for sustainable development is deeply tied to its capacity to address the severe deficits in its care infrastructure. At the centre of both the crisis and the potential solution stands the Bangladeshi nurse, the quiet yet indispensable pillar of the country’s healthcare system. In Bangladesh, the notion of ‘taking care’ unfolds in a context of relentless pressure and chronic scarcity. The healthcare sector is forced to grapple with the dual challenge of combating persistent communicable diseases such as tuberculosis while simultaneously confronting the rise of non-communicable conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. This complex and evolving disease landscape pushes an already strained health system to its limits. The statistics tell a stark story. The World Health Organisation recommends a doctor-to-nurse ratio of 1:3.5, yet Bangladesh’s reality stands inverted at roughly 1:0.4. In practice, this means that for every ten doctors, there are only four nurses, creating a workload that is simply unmanageable for those at the frontline of care. This shortage shapes the daily reality of nurses across the country. They are the primary providers of direct, personal and relational care, but the crushing patient load often leaves them physically and emotionally exhausted. Studies reveal that doctors in tertiary hospitals, themselves under immense pressure, can spend an average of just 48 seconds with each patient. It is the nurse who must then fill the void, managing not only medical tasks but also offering emotional reassurance, guidance and education to patients and their families. This work is carried out with remarkable dedication, but too often without adequate time, institutional backing, or societal recognition. The challenges, however, extend far beyond individual effort. They are rooted in deep structural problems that define the state of healthcare in Bangladesh. The country faces an acute shortage of health professionals across the board. With only seven doctors per 10,000 people, compared with the WHO recommendation of 22.8, the system is chronically under-resourced. This shortfall is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where the majority of Bangladeshis live, widening the divide in access to care between urban and rural populations. At the same time, the absence of a comprehensive public insurance scheme has resulted in an alarming dependency on out-of-pocket spending, an estimated 74 per cent of total health expenditure. For countless families, this means that a medical emergency can quickly spiral into a financial catastrophe. Such pressure often translates into frustration and aggression towards nurses, who are the most visible faces of the system. Working conditions for nurses further exacerbate the strain. Excessive workloads have become a major source of stress and burnout, compounded by low wages and the absence of proper risk allowances, a problem laid bare during the Covid-19 pandemic. Beyond financial concerns, many nurses also face social stigma and safety issues in the workplace. Female nurses in particular report feeling unsafe during night shifts, citing the risk of harassment and the lack of secure facilities such as dressing rooms and toilets. These factors collectively erode morale and discourage many from staying in the profession. At the same time, a proliferation of unregulated private pharmacies and diagnostic centres has complicated the healthcare landscape, undermining public trust and making the work of trained nurses even more difficult. As Bangladesh looks to the future, it must also prepare for a new set of challenges emerging within the care economy, particularly those shaped by technology and evolving social needs. One promising yet complex frontier lies in the application of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare. The government’s ‘Digital Health Strategy 2023–2027’ signals a decisive move in this direction. AI has the potential to transform healthcare delivery: autonomous systems could enhance caregiver productivity, AI-powered diagnostic tools such as CAD4TB are already assisting with tuberculosis screening, and clinical natural language processing could significantly reduce the administrative burdens on nurses, freeing them to spend more time with patients. Yet, while optimism about AI runs high, so too do the challenges. Weak digital infrastructure, unreliable connectivity, and an acute shortage of data science skills could easily blunt these innovations. For AI to succeed, it must complement rather than replace the human touch that lies at the heart of care. Another urgent but often neglected dimension is mental health, particularly among adolescents. Bangladesh’s vast young population faces mounting academic pressure, social anxiety, and the psychological effects of prolonged screen exposure and shifting family dynamics. Encouragingly, a number of institutions are beginning to respond. The National Institute of Mental Health now operates a ‘Child, Adolescent and Family Psychiatry’ unit, while private centres such as MindSheba and Bangladesh Psychiatric Care are providing therapy and counselling grounded in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Importantly, these initiatives recognise that adolescent mental health is not an isolated issue, it requires active involvement from families, schools and communities. The country must also strengthen care for persons with disabilities, an area that has long depended on the dedication of the non-profit sector. More than 16 million Bangladeshis live with disabilities, and organisations working with differently abled individuals have pioneered holistic models of support that go beyond medical treatment. They provide physiotherapy, assistive technology such as prosthetics and Braille materials, and inclusive education and employment opportunities. Their community-based rehabilitation approach offers a powerful example of how care can be transformed from a matter of household responsibility into a process of genuine social inclusion and dignity. Addressing Bangladesh’s care crisis, therefore, requires a multi-layered response that engages public institutions, private initiatives and families alike. Strengthening hospital care must go hand in hand with expanding quality care outside hospital walls. The formalisation of home-based care services is an essential part of this process. Social enterprises such as Home & Community Care Ltd are already leading the way by training and deploying background-checked caregivers who assist with everything from companionship and hygiene to clinical procedures such as tube feeding and oxygen management. These initiatives not only ease the burden on families and hospitals but also create new, formal employment opportunities within the care economy. Public–Private Partnerships can also play a strategic role in addressing funding and infrastructure gaps. The government’s PPP Authority has rightly identified healthcare as a key area for collaboration. Such partnerships have shown promise in specific cases, such as expanding affordable dialysis services. However, their success depends on accountability, transparency, and trust. When profit motives overshadow public welfare, as seen in recent protests over fee hikes in PPP-run facilities, the credibility of these partnerships suffers. For PPPs to work, they must remain firmly anchored in the principle of equitable access to care. Ultimately, no reform can succeed without recognising and investing in the true heart of the care economy, the nurse. This investment must be comprehensive, extending beyond recruitment to ensuring fair wages, proper benefits, and meaningful risk allowances. It must also guarantee safe and respectful workplaces, free from harassment and equipped with gender-sensitive facilities. Nurses should receive advanced training in new technologies such as AI-based patient monitoring, as well as in specialised fields including geriatric, palliative and mental health care. Most importantly, society must elevate the status of nursing itself. Public campaigns that celebrate the profession’s essential contribution to national well-being can help dismantle stigma and foster pride among current and future nurses. The global framework of the care economy offers Bangladesh a valuable lens through which to shape its development agenda. By addressing systemic shortages, investing in its nursing workforce, embracing technology thoughtfully, and building an inclusive care ecosystem, the nation can transform its current crisis into an opportunity for progress. The care economy is not merely a sector, it is the foundation upon which the health, dignity and social cohesion of Bangladesh will rest in the years to come.

The conflict has led the students to allege that a law teacher was trying to shield the rape suspects, while the teachers have accused that the teachers were behaving with them disrespectfully over the matter. Students have particularly accused law lecturer Lemon Hossain of attempting to secure the release of four law students who were arrested on December 3 for allegedly raping a fellow student, filming the assault and later extorting money from her through intimidation. They alleged that Lemon Hossain went to the Ashulia police station the same day following the arrests and tried to influence the process to get the accused released. The survivor in the alleged rape incident also accused Lemon of indecent acts directed at female students. Lemon Hossain used to send her indecent messages and innuendos, she told a press briefing organised on the campus on Tuesday afternoon. Students on the day also held demonstrations on the campus, demanding Lemon’s dismissal and strict action against the four arrested. Lemon Hossain was at the centre of a highly publicised case when in 2011 a Rapid Action Battalion member shot him, a 16-year-old boy at the time, near his Jhalokathi home. The incident led to the amputation of a leg and a protracted legal battle which still goes on with Lemon filing a complaint with the International Crimes Tribunal end of 2024. Lemon became a law graduate later and joined Gono Bishwabidyalay. At Gono Bishwabidyalay, meanwhile, the teachers protested at the students’ reaction, alleging disrespectful behaviour. The deans’ committee at the university observed a daylong work abstention on Monday in protest at alleged bullying, harassment and vilification online they were facing over the rape incident and the case filed afterwards. They alleged that some students and outsiders were spreading abusive comments targeting faculty members, eroding campus discipline. The teachers also submitted a six-point memorandum to vice-chancellor Md Abul Hossain on Sunday, demanding the identification of and ‘highest form of disciplinary action’ for the students involved in spreading online abuse against the teachers within three working days. The memo—handed over by deans’ committee chair Professor Zahirul Islam Khan—called for the formation of a cyber-cell to counter defamatory content circulating on that social media, which they said was worsening tensions between the students and teachers. Professor Zahirul told New Age on Tuesday that certain students, along with outsiders, verbally attacked teachers, attempted to assault them and used social media to ‘spread insults and threats’. He further said that teachers were preparing to form a faculty forum, with deans as advisers and two teachers from each department as executive members, to collectively address their harassment. In the memo teachers warned that they would withdraw from additional duties if the ‘demeaning behaviour’ by students persisted. The university administration formed a five-member probe body to investigate the alleged negligence of the teachers concerned in handling the rape case. It also put law department’s associate professor Rafiqul Alam and lecturer Lemon Hossain on leave until the seven-day investigation complete. Contacted, Lemon Hossain termed the allegations as baseless and intentional.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/284737/gono-bishwabidyalay-teachers-students-at-loggerheads-over-rape-case", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 540},
{"title": "N Korea says ‘special assets’ deployed against South", "body": "Kim Jong Un said North Korea deployed ‘special assets’ in response to what he called Washington’s arms build-up in the South, state media reported Sunday. The United States stations about 28,500 troops in the South to fend off military threats from the nuclear-armed North and last month conducted a joint military exercise with its security allies South Korea and Japan. Pyongyang routinely denounces such drills as rehearsals for invasion, while the allies insist they are defensive in nature. ‘The US-ROK nuclear alliance is making rapid progress, and they are conducting various kinds of exercises to execute dangerous scenarios,’ Kim said in a speech marking the opening of a weapons exhibition in Pyongyang on Saturday, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. ‘In direct proportion to the US military’s arms build-up in the ROK region, our strategic concern about this region has also grown, and accordingly we have assigned our special assets to the major targets,’ he said, adding he was ‘closely watching’ the military development across the border. ‘The enemy will have to worry about which direction their security environment is moving in,’ he added without clarifying what the special assets were. Photos released by KCNA show Kim walking past weapons, including a missile, surrounded by North Korean generals in an indoor exhibition centre. Kim last month said he was open to talks with the United States, noting he had ‘fond memories’ of president Donald Trump, on the condition that his country does not give up its nuclear arsenal. Kim met Trump three times for high-profile summits during Trump’s first term, before talks collapsed in Hanoi in 2019 over what concessions Pyongyang was prepared to make on its atomic weapons. The US demand that Kim give up his banned weapons has long been a sticking point between the two countries, with Pyongyang under successive rounds of UN sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Since the failed 2019 summit, North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its atomic weapons and declared itself an ‘irreversible’ nuclear state.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/278151/n-korea-says-special-assets-deployed-against-south", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 340},
{"title": "Breaking the shackles", "body": "WE ARE here, yet unseen in the public sphere. We live, but severed from the social fabric. The faint hum of invisible shackles continues to echo somewhere. This year, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, urges us to embrace the theme of ‘fostering disability-inclusive societies for advancing social progress.’ Yet we can already predict the familiar, repetitive state-sanctioned statements marking the official occasion: declarations that persons with disabilities are not burdens, that their talents must be harnessed, and that they must be reshaped into ‘human assets.’ Development workers in this sector will likely affirm that progress is underway, while rightly advocating for increased allocations for essential support, adequate education, and vocational training. Even so, we remain bound by the question: which path will bring true freedom for our fellow citizens with disabilities? Why do we even need to speak of this ‘freedom’? Are we imprisoned, then? The education system is our first prison. Decades have passed without it fundamentally aligning with the needs of disability. It was never designed for us; it was built instead upon a foundation that systematically disregards our requirements. The Inclusive Education Policy 2010 is crumbling to dust, while in the name of ‘special education,’ we remain segregated and isolated. The existing framework of integrated education remains narrowly focused on students with visual disabilities. Even then, it operates within an outdated, segregated medical model rooted in long-discredited principles of charity and pity. We live in the twenty-first century, an era driven by technology. So how is it that in our nation alone, students with visual disabilities continue to be systematically excluded from studying core subjects such as Science, Mathematics, and Information Technology at the higher secondary level? Only eight schools exist for a million students with hearing disabilities, further compounded by a severe lack of Bangla Sign Language interpreters. For these students, and for those with hearing-visual disabilities, Autism, Down syndrome, intellectual disabilities, and other severe disabilities—can we point to a single model school in this country that genuinely provides integrated education tailored to their needs? Then begins the struggle for survival. A deep scarcity of employment opportunities affects our young and educated persons with disabilities. Discrimination persists through unequal scribe policies, and even when they qualify in job examinations, many are ultimately rejected under the pretext of their disability. The so-called ‘reserved seats’ on public transport are a cruel joke. The struggle begins the moment we try to buy a ticket. Our advocacy with the BRTC has dragged on for over a decade, yet not a single accessible public bus has taken to the roads. Where is accessibility not a problem? It is a void in both infrastructure and technology—everywhere, without exception. We are even marginalised in life’s most fundamental aspects. From property rights to founding a family, from marriage to the simplest dream of building a future with a life partner, we face nothing but walls. Confusion over the identification survey is already evident. All in all, every door remains firmly shut. Government statistics count us at less than half a crore. Yet reports from the World Health Organization and the World Bank indicate that this country is home to nearly two and a half crore persons with disabilities. For 18 years, the renowned UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) — champion of the motto ‘NOTHING ABOUT US, WITHOUT US’— has been ignored, left to gather dust in a profound betrayal of its principles. While the sustainable development goals march forward in new attire under the banner of ‘SDGs for All,’ the rights of persons with disabilities have sunk to the bottom under the heavy weight of this grand development agenda. The laws and policies made in this country lie almost decayed, trapped in red tape. Even when discussions turn to class- and gender-based discrimination, the deep and complex layers of discrimination faced by persons with disabilities are consistently overlooked. This discrimination and neglect are entrenched at every level — family, society, and state — devouring the psyche and silently consuming many persons with disabilities from within. The result: we stand as the most excluded of the excluded. While the rights movement for persons with disabilities concerns a marginalised community, it is undeniably a political issue as well. Politicians are expected to lead and hold the government accountable, while development workers are supposed to play a strong advocacy role in ensuring implementation. Then why this outcry? Is anything actually being done? Are any meaningful, constructive efforts even underway? Why does reform remain elusive? In Bangladesh, the dominant narrative surrounding persons with disabilities is still rooted in ‘charity’ and ‘benevolence.’ It reflects a medical, welfare-oriented model that frames citizens with disabilities as patients—vulnerable, dependent, and fundamentally incapable of autonomy. Whether in government initiatives or NGO programmes, persons with disabilities are consistently portrayed as ‘helpless.’ Our so-called ‘development’ efforts remain stuck in a cycle of distributing assistive devices and organising training sessions, workshops, and job fairs. Yet no significant progress is visible towards lasting solutions such as employment and livelihoods. Even at job fairs organised by NGOs, no data is reported on how many participants actually secure employment. The same individuals receive training year after year, while pathways to dignified livelihoods remain blocked. Persons with disabilities receive meagre government pensions. With no stable income, many are forced to repeat training programmes primarily to access travel allowances and meals. A striking example of the medical model in practice is the state’s continued placement of disability affairs under the Ministry of Social Welfare, framing it as a charity-based issue rather than a matter of rights and empowerment. In today’s world, the concept of ‘representation of women carried out by men’ seems absurd to society. We are not accustomed to seeing men represent women in government or NGO committees at the policy-making level on women’s rights, nor would women accept it. So why has the culture of self-representation for persons with disabilities in state and policy-level decision-making still failed to take root? Decisions about the lives of persons with disabilities continue to be made by non-disabled people, and ironically, this lack of representation rarely sparks protest or objection even from within the community. While leadership exercised by persons with disabilities has advanced over the past few decades, in reality it is leaders without disabilities—from donor agencies, government policy bodies, and NGOs providing services ‘for the people’—who continue to determine our fate. Organisations of Persons with Disabilities (OPDs) remain entirely dependent on donors. In trying to maintain nominal leadership over administrative, financial, and programmatic decisions, we often fall into the trap of donor-driven funding. In fulfilling project objectives and conditions, we lose sight of the struggle for rights. This results in a crisis of effective leadership, leaving most leaders with disabilities little more than puppets in the hands of external authorities. We often speak of the social model of disability or rights-based awareness. NGOs organise advocacy programmes, yet coordination and unity among OPDs are absent. Consequently, even after 55 years of independence, we remain far behind. Generation after generation, new organisations and networks are formed with almost identical goals, yet tangible rights-based gains remain out of reach. Primarily, our dependence on donor agencies — and secondarily, the lack of coordination and intersectionality — has kept our practice of decision-making and empowerment far behind, even after 55 years of independence. At present, none of the persons with disabilities in leadership positions has succeeded in breaking free from the medical model to implement rights-based, people-centred approaches. We acknowledge the argument in theory, but we have failed to put it into practice. At this point, most development professionals working in the disability sector may disagree with this assessment. This raises a pressing question: why, at the end of the day, is there still no visible change? For meaningful progress, the general population must begin to view persons with disabilities as equal citizens and members of society — not subjects of sympathy. At the same time, professionals working across different sectors — development workers, social workers, journalists, politicians, academics, lawyers, women’s rights activists, writers, filmmakers, and others who shape public discourse—must integrate a rights-based perspective into their thinking and practice. This is particularly crucial within the bureaucracy and among state-level policymakers who hold the authority to design and implement national strategies, if they truly intend to build a modern, inclusive, discrimination-free society. Without this transformation, the long-standing charity-based mindset will persist, and the pathway towards a more dignified approach to disability will remain obstructed. We need a societal lens that does not label persons with disabilities as ‘special needs,’ ‘specially challenged,’ or ‘golden citizens,’ but recognises us simply — and respectfully — as persons with disabilities. This requires that society take at least the minimum responsibility necessary to ensure our rightful entitlements. My expectation from the country’s intellectual community — those who sit closest to the power structure and shape the blueprint of national transformation — is that the near-complete invisibility of persons with disabilities in the political landscape should unsettle them. It should prompt them to think differently, to question: why is it that in this country, persons with disabilities remain absent and unheard in social, cultural and political movements? Why are we missing from public discourse, from national dialogues, and from the roles that shape the state? Through this writing, I seek to draw the attention of those policymakers and thinkers whose ideas nourish the intellectual life of our society.

The police have arrested nearly 3,000 leaders and activists of the banned AL and its affiliated organizations from Dhaka city this year for their involvement in flash processions, which have occurred after the interim government in May banned all AL activities pending their trials for alleged atrocities during the July 2024 uprising. Addressing a press conference at the Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Media Centre on Friday afternoon, DMP Deputy Commissioner for media and public relations Talebur Rahman said that police conducted drives in different areas of the city and arrested 46 people while making preparations to bring out flash processions. According to him, 18 were arrested by the police of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police station while four by Khilkhet police station, two by Uttara police station, three by Badda police station, three by Banani police station, three by Tejgaon police station and 13 were arrested by Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit. When asked about the total number of arrested AL and its affiliated organisation leaders and activists, the DMP official said that police arrested about 3,000 leaders and activists so far.

{"title": "Normal security not ensured at Delhi mission, says Touhid", "body": "Bangladesh foreign minister Md Touhid Hossain on Sunday said that ‘normal security’ was not maintained at the Bangladesh mission in India and the high commissioner, who was staying there with his family, felt threatened. Rejecting India’s press statement on Saturday’s demonstration in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, he said that Bangladesh would rely on the host country for the security and expected that the incident in Delhi would not be repeated in the future. ‘We completely reject the press note. How come a group of Hindu militants were allowed to move to that area -- much inside the diplomatic enclave? They were not supposed to be allowed there. They have said many things,’ said Touhid responding to reporters’ questions at his ministry. ‘We have come to know that the demonstrators threatened to kill the high commissioner although we don’t have any evidence,’ said Touhid. He said that Dhaka hoped that the Indian government would take necessary steps to enhance the security of the diplomatic mission. The foreign affairs ministry later in a press release said that the ‘unjustifiable incident’ at the Bangladesh high commission residence in New Delhi was highly regrettable and could not be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’. Bangladesh has, however, noted the commitment of the government of India to ensure the safety and security of all Bangladesh diplomatic posts in India. Responding to media queries on the reported demonstration in front of the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi on December 20, 2025, India’s external affairs ministry Randhir Jaiswal on Sunday in a statement said that there was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. He further said that India was committed to ensure safety of foreign missions in its territory. ‘We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident. The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi on 20 December and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,’ he said. Jaiswal said that the police stationed on the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes. ‘Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,’ he added. India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh, according to the statement. ‘Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,’ Jaiswal said. About the lynching of the youth in Mymensingh, the Bangladesh foreign adviser said that the murder of an individual was not an issue of minority and it might happen anywhere. The victim was a Bangladeshi citizen and the important thing was that prompt actions were under way in the case, he mentioned. The government of Bangladesh has promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident, the foreign ministry release said. ‘The inter-communal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia. Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,’ it mentioned.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/foreign%20affairs/285795/normal-security-not-ensured-at-delhi-mission-says-touhid", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 571},
{"title": "Bangladesh seeks global opportunities at Techtextil and Texprocess 2026", "body": "Bangladesh’s efforts to enhance value addition in its garment and textile sectors are set to gain significant momentum with the upcoming Techtextil and Texprocess 2026 fairs in Frankfurt.

The Messe Frankfurt press briefing, held at The Westin Dhaka, marked the official announcement of the 2026 editions of both fairs, scheduled for April 21-24, 2026. Messe Frankfurt is a global leader in textile trade shows. Romana Afroze, head of operations for Messe Frankfurt SP Bangladesh, expressed optimism that a dedicated Bangladesh pavilion—jointly organised by the Export Promotion Bureau and the BGMEA—would highlight leading companies in technical and value-added textiles, showcasing the country’s growing capabilities in high-value garment and textile production. Afroze emphasised the strategic importance of these flagship fairs, noting that they continue to push the boundaries of innovation, sustainability, and technology adoption in the global textile and apparel industries. The combined platform will allow visitors to explore the entire textile value chain—from fiber production and advanced machinery to innovative fabrics, end-use applications, and recycling technologies. According to organisers, this exposure is particularly timely for Bangladesh, given the increasing demand for technical textiles in sectors such as healthcare, automotive, construction, and sports. As Bangladesh seeks to transition from basic apparel manufacturing to more specialised, innovation-driven production, participation in these events will be key to creating new value-added opportunities and enhancing the country’s long-term competitiveness in the global textile market.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/282692/bangladesh-seeks-global-opportunities-at-techtextil-and-texprocess-2026", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 263},
{"title": "Net NSC sales drop by 53pc in July-Oct", "body": "Net sales of National Savings Certificates fell sharply at the start of the current fiscal year as the government deliberately scaled back its reliance on high-cost savings instruments and shifted toward cheaper borrowing sources, while inflation continued to erode household saving capacity. Bangladesh Bank data showed that net NSC sales dropped by 53.61 per cent to Tk 2,369 crore during July–October of FY26, from Tk 5,107 crore in the same period a year earlier. Although sales remained positive, the steep fall marked a continuation of a longer-term retreat from savings certificates as both policy priorities and investor behaviour changed. For the past three fiscal years, net NSC sales have remained negative on an annual basis. Net sales stood at negative Tk 6,063 crore in FY25 after plunging to a record negative Tk 21,124 crore in FY24, following negative Tk 3,295 crore in FY23. The outstanding stock of NSCs declined to Tk 3.41 lakh crore in October 2025 from Tk 3.51 lakh crore a year earlier, reflecting steady repayments exceeding new issuance. Economists said that inflation has played a central role in weakening demand for savings certificates. Inflation has stayed above 8 per cent for nearly three years, squeezing real incomes and forcing many households to cash in matured certificates to meet daily expenses rather than reinvest. Although inflation eased slightly to 8.17 per cent in October, it remained high enough to blunt the appeal of fixed-return instruments. At the same time, the government has moved away from NSCs as a borrowing tool because of their high interest costs. Returns on savings certificates exceed those on treasury bills and bonds, making them an expensive source of financing. To contain debt-servicing pressure, the government has prioritised repayment over fresh issuance and relied more on banks and market-based instruments. This strategy is evident in the government’s broader borrowing pattern. During July–November, net borrowing from the banking system stood at about Tk 35,000 crore. For FY26, the government has set a net bank borrowing target of Tk 1.04 lakh crore, lower than Tk 1.36 lakh crore in FY25, signalling tighter control over domestic financing and a preference for lower-cost options. Rising bank deposit rates have further reduced the relative attractiveness of NSCs. Several private banks are now offering fixed-deposit returns between 8 and 11 per cent, narrowing the gap with savings certificates while providing greater liquidity and digital access. Moreover, many individuals also purchased treasury bills which offer hefty returns. Policy tightening has also weighed on NSC demand. Since 2021, interest rates on savings certificates have been cut by up to two percentage points, while stricter documentation requirements, including mandatory national ID and tax return proof for purchases above Tk 5 lakh, have limited access. Although aimed at curbing misuse by affluent investors, the measures have discouraged some small savers as well. Net NSC sales peaked at Tk 52,417 crore in FY17 and Tk 49,939 crore in FY19, but current trends indicate a structural shift in government borrowing strategy, with lasting implications for household savings, fiscal costs and debt management.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/286111/net-nsc-sales-drop-by-53pc-in-july-oct", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 506},

{"title": "US demands Google ad breakup in court closing arguments", "body": "The US government asked a federal judge on Friday to order the breakup of Google’s digital advertising business, arguing that the tech giant’s pledges to change its practices cannot be trusted. Government lawyers made their case in closing arguments of a lawsuit focused on Google’s ad tech ‘stack’ -- the suite of tools that website publishers use to sell ads and advertisers use to buy them. This marks a second major antitrust test for Google this year. In September, a judge rejected a similar Department of Justice demand to break up the California-based tech giant’s world-dominating search engine business. These cases are part of a broader US government effort to curtail the competitive dominance of big tech companies, including Apple, Amazon and Meta. Results have been mixed so far -- another judge decided against government lawyers in a suit against Meta’s social media empire earlier this week. In a brief filed ahead of Friday’s arguments, the DOJ and multiple US states accused Google of illegally acquiring monopolies in two interconnected advertising technology markets through a ‘decade-long campaign of ever-mutating unlawful conduct.’ The government’s case portrays Google as simultaneously controlling multiple sides of the digital advertising marketplace -- owning the platform that publishers use to sell ads, the exchange where transactions occur, and commanding huge advertiser demand. According to the DOJ, Google once compared this arrangement to Goldman Sachs owning the New York Stock Exchange. ‘We are here to fix the problem. We will argue that the best solution is to break up Google’s monopoly, which will create a new competitor,’ assistant attorney general Gail Slater said in a post on X. Google has pushed back, characterizing the proposed remedies as extreme government overreach that would harm publishers, advertisers and consumers. The company argues its integrated advertising tools deliver efficiency and innovation and that splitting up the service would be technically unfeasible. The closing arguments follow a liability ruling earlier this year in which Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema found that Google willfully monopolized both the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets. Prosecutors are seeking sweeping remedies, including forcing the sale of Google’s AdX ad exchange and requiring the company to open-source critical auction technology. According to Laurel Kilgour of the American Economic Liberties Project, Brinkema expressed worry that her remedy decision risked having to be undone, with Google almost certain to appeal, potentially dragging out the process for years. The closing arguments capped a remedies trial featuring testimony from 19 witnesses and seven experts over 11 days. The judge in the search case cited the emergence of AI as a reason for treading lightly against Google. In the ad tech case, DOJ lawyers argue the opposite -- that artificial intelligence advances will likely entrench rather than challenge Google’s dominance.

{"title": "Flights resume at Munich airport after second drone scare", "body": "Flights resumed ‘progressively’ on Saturday at Munich airport, but delays were expected after a drone scare caused a second shutdown in as many days, affecting over 6,500 passengers, the operator said. Airports in Denmark, Norway and Poland have recently suspended flights due to unidentified drones, while Romania and Estonia have pointed the finger at Russia, which has brushed off the allegations. Munich airport said that on Friday ‘from 9:30 pm air traffic was restricted and then cancelled due to drone sightings’, meaning 23 incoming flights were diverted and 12 bound for Munich were cancelled. Forty-six departures from the airport had to be cancelled or delayed until Saturday, with a total of 6,500 passengers affected. A police spokesman told AFP that there were ‘two simultaneous confirmed drone sightings by police patrols just before 11 pm around the north and south runways’. ‘The drones immediately moved away, before they could be identified,’ he added. ‘As on the previous night, the airport, in collaboration with the airlines, promptly provided supplies for passengers in the terminals. Camp beds were set up, along with blankets, drinks, and snacks,’ the airport said. The first disruption on Thursday caused more than 30 flights to be cancelled there and left nearly 3,000 passengers stranded. It began at 8:30 pm local time when police say drones were spotted in areas close to the airport, including the towns of Freising and Erding. Erding plays host to an airfield used by the German military. Bild newspaper said some of the drones were spotted flying over the facility, although police could not confirm this. The first drones near the airport perimeter were seen around 9:05 pm on Thursday, and then over the airport complex about an hour later. The sightings ended around midnight, but not before causing the closure of both runways. Police helicopters were deployed but ‘no information is available on the type and number of drones’, police said. Earlier on Friday German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the first night’s incident was a ‘wake-up call’ on the threat from drones. ‘The race between the threat from drones and the defence against drones is becoming more and more difficult,’ he told Bild, adding that ‘more financing and research’ on the issue was urgently needed at the national and European levels. The disruptions came as the country celebrated German Unity Day on Friday—a national holiday—and as Munich geared up for the final weekend of Oktoberfest, which draws hundreds of thousands of people the city every day. The annual beer gala and funfair had already closed for half a day on Wednesday after a bomb scare. The German government is expected on Wednesday to sign off on plans for a change in the law to let the army shoot drones down if necessary. The drone sightings in Denmark and high-profile aerial incursions in Estonia and Poland have heightened fears that Russia’s assault on Ukraine could spill over Europe’s borders. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Europe on Thursday that the recent drone incursions showed Moscow was looking to ‘escalate’ its aggression.

{"title": "Tarique returns home to roaring reception", "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chair Tarique Rahman returned to the country on Thursday after ending 17 years in forced exile in the United Kingdom, marking his homecoming with a historic reception attended by over 10 lakh people. Tarique arrived at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at around 11:40am on a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight from London. He was accompanied by his wife Zubaida Rahman, their daughter Zaima Rahman, and the family’s pet cat Zeebu. Extensive security measures were in place as he travelled from the airport to the designated reception venue along the Purbachal Expressway, known as the 300 Feet Road. Tarique delivered a brief speech in response at the mass reception before meeting his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who has been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital for more than a month and remains in a critical condition. In his address, the BNP acting chair expressed gratitude to the people for their overwhelming support, saying that he had a plan aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh. Although he did not provide details of the plan, he expressed confidence that the country could move forward through collective efforts. Tarique also urged all sections of society to stay united and called for the maintenance of peace, discipline and public safety, stressing the importance of national harmony during the current period. Shortly after landing at the airport, Tarique was seen passionately touching the soil of his homeland, a symbolic gesture that resonated strongly with his supporters and marked the end of his long absence from the country. ‘This country is home to people of the hills and the plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians. Together, we want to build a Bangladesh – which a mother dreams of – that is a safe Bangladesh,’ he said. Tarique reflected on the country’s political history and struggles, recalling the Liberation War of 1971, the November 7 event in 1975, the mass movement against the military rule in 1990, and the 2024 mass uprising. ‘Our beloved motherland was achieved in 1971 at the cost of the blood of countless martyrs. In the same spirit, the people of this country – students, farmers, workers, women, and men from all walks of life – stood united on August 2024 to protect Bangladesh’s independence and sovereignty,’ he said. The people of Bangladesh, Tarique Rahman said, now want to regain their right to speak freely and their democratic rights. Soon after disembarking, Tarique was taken to the airport VIP lounge, where he was received at 11:56am by BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, other senior party leaders and family members. His mother-in-law, Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu, welcomed him by placing a floral garland around his neck. From the VIP lounge, Tarique made a phone call to chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, thanking him for the arrangements made for his return and security. He then boarded a specially prepared bulletproof bus bearing the slogan ‘Bangladesh First’ at its front. Tarique’s motorcade left the airport at around 12:30pm under heavy security, with army personnel deployed on both sides of his route. At around 3:50pm, the BNP acting chair arrived at the reception venue when the surrounding areas became full of life with slogans chanted by party leaders, activists, and supporters. The area witnessed great excitement as he took to the stage and waved in response to greetings and goodwill gestures from the gathering. Tarique said that the blood of the martyrs had placed a responsibility on the nation to build the Bangladesh they had envisioned, adding that repaying this debt required collective efforts to realise the country the people expected and to work together for their welfare. He also appealed for calm and order, repeatedly urging everyone to avoid disorder and saying that the country needed peace. Tarique paid tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, the young activist of the July uprising who was recently killed by bullets, saying that Hadi had wanted democracy to be established and the democratic rights of the people to be restored. ‘No matter what our religion, class, or political identity are, we must ensure peace and security in this country at all costs,’ Tarique asserted. From the early hours of the morning, massive crowds began gathering at the reception site. By 10:00am, the venue and surrounding neighbourhoods were completely packed with activists and supporters, leaving little space open. Security personnel were deployed throughout the venue and nearby places to maintain order. Large screens installed on and around the stage showcased documentaries on BNP founder Ziaur Rahman and the July uprising. Supporters continued arriving from multiple highways, while many processions were accompanied by band music, adding to the celebratory mood as followers welcomed Tarique Rahman back to the country. Before concluding, Tarique spoke emotionally about his mother -- BNP chair Khaleda Zia -- saying that she is a person who has loved the soil of this country and its people more than her own life. Tarique said that although his heart, as a son, was with his mother in her hospital room, he could not avoid the people for whom Khaleda Zia had dedicated her life, citing that that was why he chose to address the gathering before visiting her. BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and standing committee members were present on the reception stage. Among others, leaders of the BNP’s allied parties— including Bangladesh Jatiya Party, Nagorik Oikya, Ganosamhati Andolan, Gono Odhikar Parishad, Gono Forum, National Democratic Movement, and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Bangladesh -- also attended the reception. Although leaders of the National Citizen Party were not present, party convener Nahid Islam hailed Tarique’s homecoming in a Facebook post. After concluding the reception Tarique headed to Evercare Hospital to visit his mother Khaleda Zia. He left the reception stage at around 4:45pm and arrived at the hospital at approximately 5:50pm. The 79-year old leader, who has long been suffering from multiple chronic health complications, including liver and kidney diseases, heart ailments, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis and recurrent infections, was admitted to Evercare Hospital on November 23. After visiting his ailing mother at her bedside, Tarique left the hospital at around 7:00pm, heading to his Gulshan residence in a convoy. Tarique Rahman had previously been sentenced in several cases, including to a life-term imprisonment, and faced numerous other charges, most of which were filed during the 2007–08 military-backed caretaker government. He was arrested during an anti-corruption drive in March 2007 and released on bail on September 3, 2008, after which he travelled to London on September 11 for medical treatment and remained there. Following the end of the Awami League’s 16-year rule on August 5, 2024 amid a mass uprising, the High Court acquitted Tarique of all cases filed during both the caretaker government and Awami League administration periods, clearing the legal hurdles to his return. On the occasion of Tarique’s return, most city roads remained relatively clear on Thursday, except around the reception venue, as public transport was limited. Commuters struggled to find buses, CNG auto-rickshaws, and ridesharing vehicles, with some paying significantly higher fares than usual. Inter-district bus services operated normally on northern, southern, and western routes, but those to Gazipur and Mymensingh did not run until the afternoon. The Bangladesh Railway cancelled three scheduled trains but operated 10 special services to transport BNP leaders and supporters from remote areas. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police effected road diversions and designated parking for party vehicles, while the Dhaka airport allowed entry only to the authorised passengers. Biman Bangladesh Airlines advised its passengers to allocate extra time for their travels. Meanwhile, the Dhaka Elevated Expressway was made toll-free for four hours between 11:00am and 3:00pm under interim government arrangements.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/286210/tarique-returns-home-to-roaring-reception", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 1276},
{"title": "Elections only way out of governance mess", "body": "THE string of arson attacks taking place on Election Commission offices outside Dhaka, cultural organisations in Dhaka and elsewhere, newspaper houses in Dhaka and their offices in outlying districts and even private houses appears not to be isolated. The surge in such incidents came about by exploiting the tragic murder of Sharif Osman Hadi, a noted face of the July uprising and spokesperson of Inquilab Mancha, on December 18. Osman Hadi died while being treated in Singapore after being shot at during an electoral campaign in Dhaka on December 12. Certain groups and entities appear to be behind the incidents. Offices of the Daily Star and Prothom Alo were burnt in Dhaka and in some other places on December 18. The cultural organisation Chhayanaut was vandalised and burnt that night. A Hindu young man was beaten to death on apparently false allegations and was then burnt in Mymensingh. The Udichi building in Dhaka was set on fire the next day. The house of a local BNP leader in Lakshmipur was set on fire on December 19 after it had been locked, burning a minor girl to death. The Election Commission office in Kushtia was burnt on December 20. The series of events could well be viewed as a move to frustrate the national elections, set to be held on February 12. Whilst the attacks on the Daily Star and Prothom Alo happened by cashing in on the murder of Osman Hadi, Hadi is on video record saying, when several attempts were made by a gathering to threaten Prothom Alo, that there should be no messing with Prothom Alo and more newspapers should, rather, be raised to counter Prothom Alo. Hadi’s murder appears to have been used in the attack on the newspaper offices, which ultimately negates Hadi’s position on the newspapers at hand. There has been some noise here and there suggesting that the national elections cannot be held in such a situation and the elections should not be held until the trial of Osman Hadi’s murder. All this appears to be a ploy to stop the holding of the national elections. Such a demand, raised in the event of Hadi’s murder, also contradicts the position of Hadi, who wanted to stand for the national elections in the Dhaka 8 constituency. He was attacked while he was on his electoral campaign. Most people, groups and political parties also want the elections to happen as the interim government, weak and unelected, which assumed office in August 2024, has failed to effectively deal with law and order and economic and social challenges. People hope, and rightly so, that an elected political government would be a way out of this deplorable situation.

{"title": "Mental health data not updated in 7 years", "body": "Bangladesh has not updated its national data on mental health in seven years despite rising concerns over suicide and growing psychological distress. The national mental health survey, conducted in last 2018 with World Health Organization funds, found that 16.8 per cent of adults and 13.6 per cent of children aged between 7 and 17 years suffered mental disorders. It also showed that more than 92 per cent of adults and 94 per cent of children diagnosed with such disorders had received no treatment. Experts said that the problem had intensified since then as mental health was influenced by dynamic factors such as the Covid pandemic, economic shock, climate disaster, political unrest and social pressure. They identified lack of awareness, shortage of facilities and stigma as key reasons behind the worsening situation, which they linked to the growing number of suicides. About 11,000 people died by suicide in 2021, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. When the crises are severe, facilities for treatment remain limited, largely concentrated in Dhaka and a handful of cities. According to a recent study by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, the country has only 260 psychiatrists, less than two per 10 lakh people, and about 565 psychologists. National Institute of Mental Health director Md Mahbubur Rahman said that the 2018 survey was the last nationwide study, and no funds were available for a follow-up study. He said that there was no system to update the statistics without such studies. Bangladesh conducted its first national mental health survey in 2005, which showed a prevalence of 16.1 per cent among adults, with higher rates in women (19 per cent) than men (12.9 per cent). The 2018 survey, the report of which was published in 2019, found that most patients sought care in psychiatrists’ private chambers, followed by government facilities and other physicians. Psychiatry professor Mekhla Sarkar of the National Institute of Mental Health and Hospital said that environmental changes and rapid technological exposure had drastically altered people’s mental health. She suggested limiting social media use and spending more time in natural surroundings. Achol Foundation founder Tansen Rose said that recent events, including the Covid pandemic, floods and student-led political movements, had deepened stress, especially among students. ‘For the lack of updated information, we do not know the scale of vulnerability, but suicides are clearly on the rise,’ he said. Dhaka University clinical psychology professor Kamal Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury said that although hundreds of psychology graduates passed out every year, most were not absorbed into the profession. ‘There are no institutional posts for psychologists at district or upazila level hospitals,’ he said, urging the government to create jobs, ensure patient safety, and establish a monitoring agency to uphold treatment standards and protect rights. Bangladesh Psychological Association secretary general M Shamsuddin Elias said that the government allocated only 0.5 per cent of the health budget for mental health, which he called evidence of negligence. ‘Only six out of 56 public universities offer psychology courses. Many trained graduates remain unemployed while unqualified people provide services in the absence of a monitoring council,’ he said, demanding a professional council, code of conduct and guidelines. Health services division secretary Md Saidur Rahman admitted that mental health traditionally received less priority. He said that the absence of new surveys was not just a matter of funding but of a lack of initiatives. ‘We will increase allocations and take forward the mental health sector,’ he said. The government has recently introduced ‘Wellbeing Centres’ in some public hospitals to provide tele-mental health support for antepartum and postpartum women. ICDDR,B scientist Ahmed Ehsanur Rahman said that, at the public level, only two mental health hospitals, the National Institute of Mental Health in Dhaka and the Pabna Mental Hospital, existed, alongside the six Wellbeing Centres in four districts run jointly by the government and the ICDDR,B. ‘A large number of patients visit these facilities every day,’ he said.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/276458/mental-health-data-not-updated-in-7-years", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 654},
{"title": "IMF satisfied with Bangladesh’s reform progress, says finance adviser", "body": "Finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed on Tuesday said that the International Monetary Fund had expressed satisfaction with Bangladesh’s ongoing economic reforms although reiterated concerns over several structural challenges that require closer attention. ’They have said that the situation is overall good but they are monitoring the challenges. We are working under a plan but they feel that taking some steps a little faster would bring better outcomes,’ he told reporters after meetings of the Advisers Council Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Government Purchase at the Secretariat. He noted that the IMF is particularly concerned about the speed of policy implementation especially surrounding interest rate adjustments. ‘Increasing the policy rate by the central bank cannot be done suddenly. Everyone knows that. We have to ensure supply-side improvements at the same time,’ he said. Salehuddin also mentioned that the IMF had raised issues related to the banking sector. ‘They have taken five banks under observation which they consider a major challenge,’ he said, adding that the government needs to undertake tough reforms to strengthen financial governance. On revenue administration, the adviser said the IMF is satisfied with the current progress of the National Board of Revenue but expects reforms to continue steadily. ‘The process has become principled but manpower restructuring and capacity enhancement will take time,’ he said. He added that while it may not be possible to achieve a complete turnaround within the current government’s tenure substantial groundwork and structural preparations would be completed. ‘We may not reach the final conclusion but the logical framework and preparatory work will be done,’ he assured. Responding to a question on whether the IMF has set any new conditions, Dr Salehuddin said no fresh conditions were imposed. ‘This was more like a consultation. They expressed satisfaction with the measures we have taken so far. The economic situation is largely under control and the remaining time will be used for consolidation,’ he said. The $4.7 billion IMF loan programme, approved in January 2023, aims to support Bangladesh’s economic stability, strengthen fiscal reforms, and enhance resilience amid global economic pressures. Several tranches have already been disbursed while further installments remain tied to policy performance benchmarks and structural reforms. The IMF will delay disbursing the sixth tranche until the next national election and the new elected government assumes office. The interim government that assumed power on August 8, 2024 three days after the Awami League regime was ousted amid a mass uprising announced that the next general election would be held in February. Finance ministry officials said that they were expecting the releases of the sixth and the seventh tranches in June, 2026. On June 23, the IMF approved the release of the fourth and fifth tranches amounting to $1.3 billion, taking the overall amount of disbursement to $3.6 billion. In June 2025, the IMF also increased the overall loan amount to $5.5 billion from $4.7 billion under the loan programme that began in 2023 under the AL regime in 2023 to meet the balance of payment shortage. The progarmme period has also been extended by six months to January 27, 2027 from July 2026, following requests from Dhaka. The interim government has already reduced the balance of payment pressure. Driven by higher remittance and export earnings, the country’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to $32 billion on October 16, the highest in 31 months. The latest IMF mission is also linked to the Article IV report, an annual consultations with its member countries on overall economy, on Bangladesh.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/282498/imf-satisfied-with-bangladeshs-reform-progress-says-finance-adviser", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 584},
{"title": "Using 600-grade rods stressed to check wastage", "body": "Speakers at an event in Dhaka have said that using high-strength rods such as 600-grade could reduce the number of rods required in large concrete structures, while increasing the load-bearing capacity of the structure. They made the remarks at a technical seminar on ‘cost-effective use of 600-grade rebar and customised solutions’ at the initiative of the Technical Division of Bangladesh Bridge Authority at its conference room, said a press release on Thursday. The chief guest at the event was Mohammad Abdur Rouf, secretary of the Bridges Division and executive director of Bangladesh Bridges Authority. The keynote speaker was M Shamim Z Basunia, former professor and structural engineering expert at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. In addition, Rakib Ahsan, professor of the department of civil engineering, BUET, has given a presentation titled ‘Enhancing Economy and Sustainability through High-Strength Reinforcement in Large-Scale Concrete Structures’ at the event. Among the attendees were Quazi Mohammad Ferdous, chief engineer of the Technical Division of BBA, along with several project directors, engineers and officials. Rakib Ahsan said that using high-strength rods, high-strength reinforcement, such as 600-grade reduced the number of rods required in large concrete structures, while increasing the load-bearing capacity of the structure. ‘As a result, on the one hand, construction costs are reduced. On the other hand, an environmentally friendly solution is ensured because it is possible to build a sustainable structure using less steel,’ he said, adding that using 600-grade rods could save up to 10-25 per cent of steel compared to conventional rods, which helped reduce construction costs. ‘At the same time, due to the high strength, the amount of concrete required is also relatively low, which has a positive impact on the environment,’ he mentioned. Rakib Ahsan emphasised that the use of such high-strength rods in the construction of large infrastructure projects in Bangladesh in the future would ensure sustainable development, economic savings and long-term safety. ‘At the same time, it will be a new horizon in the construction industry of Bangladesh.’ Mentioning that the country’s bridge and infrastructure projects are expanding rapidly, Mohammad Abdur Rouf said, ‘It is very important to ensure sustainable solutions and safety in these projects. We need to use rebar that is not only cost-effective, but its high strength and durability will reduce maintenance costs in the long run.’ M Shamim Z Basunia said, ‘Bangladesh is now implementing one mega project after another. If international quality materials are not used in these projects, structural risks will remain. 600-grade rebar can ensure the sustainable strength of the structure through its advanced properties. This will increase the lifespan of the projects and make the country’s development activities more reliable.’ An experienced steel industry professional with a metallurgy background, Engr Md Saiful Islam, in his presentation, highlighted that the first quantum electric arc furnace in Asia, installed by GPH Ispat Ltd, is among the most eco-friendly and advanced steelmaking technologies now being adopted by research-based countries and leading global steelmakers. He explained, ‘Due to its state-of-the-art quality control, producing high-strength rebars, including 600 MPa grade with consistent quality is remarkably easy.’ He also noted that international rebar steelmaking standards of China, Canada, India and the United States recommend using electric arc furnace along with basic oxygen furnace or open-hearth furnace routes for rebar steel production, whereas induction furnaces were not endorsed. ‘In Bangladesh, however, most producers still rely on induction furnaces, which have not been endorsed by many countries for poor quality and sustainability concerns,’ he said. Citing the example of Thailand, he mentioned that after the Bangkok earthquake and subsequent building collapses, the Industry Ministry of Thailand decided to shut down all induction furnace-based steelmaking units due to inconsistent quality and poor sustainability. He also referred to a circular from India’s Roads and Highways Department requiring rebar certificates to include detailed information on the manufacturing process.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/278577/using-600-grade-rods-stressed-to-check-wastage", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 639},
{"title": "AB Bank’s default loans jump to 82pc", "body": "Non-performing loans at AB Bank jumped to 82 per cent of its total loan portfolio at the end of September, placing it among the six banks in Bangladesh whose defaulted loans now exceed 80 per cent of all loans they have disbursed. The bank reported Tk 30,138 crore in NPLs out of its total Tk 36,804 crore in loans at the end of September, 2025. Its bad loans, which carry almost no prospect of recovery, reached Tk 27,711 crore in September. AB Bank held deposits worth Tk 34,465 crore during the same period, meaning nearly the entire deposit base is exposed to defaulted loans. The bank’s NPL volume was far lower earlier, at Tk 8,840 crore in March and Tk 8,572 crore in December 2024, underscoring how sharply the figures escalated after recent scrutiny. Managing director and chief executive officer Syed Mizanur Rahman resigned on November 19, pending board approval. He joined AB Bank in 2011, became additional managing director in August 2024 and was appointed managing director in May 2025. He said that NPL surged due to reclassification of some non-banking assets as non-performing loans. Bangladesh Bank officials said that the NPL ratio spiked after the central bank launched an asset quality review of AB Bank. The review forced the bank to classify a large volume of previously hidden loans as defaults. These loans had been shown as unclassified despite failing to meet repayment standards. The central bank began forensic asset audits at AB Bank, IFIC Bank and National Bank on August 21 as part of a broader effort to examine distressed banks. Following the review, AB Bank came under heavy withdrawal pressure as depositors feared the bank could face the same situation as five crisis-hit Shariah-based banks that BB decided to merge. Those banks had failed to return depositors’ money, intensifying concerns across the sector. To manage the outflow, AB Bank sought Tk 2,000 crore in liquidity support from Bangladesh Bank on November 11. The bank also reported a steep fall in profitability. It said profit declined due to lower interest income, higher interest expenses and the huge rise in non-performing loans. AB Bank posted losses of Tk 1,905 crore in 2024, compared with a net profit of Tk 89.37 crore in 2023. Because of the losses, the board recommended no dividend for 2024, ending a five-year streak of dividend payments.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/282956/ab-banks-default-loans-jump-to-82pc", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 393},

{"title": "Russia, Ukraine prepare for more talks with US", "body": "Russia and Ukraine said Wednesday they were ready for more talks with the United States to end almost four years of war, after US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner left the Kremlin with no breakthrough on a peace deal. Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s talks with the US officials ended in the early hours of Wednesday, with neither side announcing concrete progress. The Kremlin said that no ‘compromise’ had been found on the crucial question of territories. The morning after the meeting, the Kremlin said it had told the Americans what was ‘unacceptable’ to them. Witkoff and Kushner brought an updated version of a US plan to end Europe’s bloodiest war in 80 years, after the US held talks with Kyiv. The Kremlin insisted it was incorrect to say Putin had rejected the plan in its entirety, and that Russia was still committed to diplomacy — despite the Russian leader issuing a stark warning that Moscow was ‘ready’ to fight Europe if it wanted war. ‘We are still ready to meet as many times as is needed to reach a peace settlement,’ said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky says any deal should offer lasting peace and ensure Moscow does not attack again. As the Americans returned from Moscow, Zelensky announced that his top negotiator Rustem Umerov and army ground chief Andriy Gnatov were headed for Brussels, where NATO foreign ministers were gathering. They will also travel to the US to meet with Trump’s envoys, Zelensky said on social media. Washington’s Steve Witkoff has held a string of Kremlin meetings but has so far not met Ukrainian officials. NATO foreign ministers are due to discuss Washington’s push to end the fighting in Brussels. ‘Ukrainian representatives will brief their colleagues in Europe on what is known following yesterday’s contacts by the American side in Moscow,’ Zelensky said on social media. The fresh talks come as NATO pledges to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of US arms for Kyiv. ‘The peace talks are on-going, that’s good, but at the same time, we have to make sure that whilst they take place — and we are not sure when they will end — that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to keep the fight going,’ NATO chief Mark Rutte said. European countries have expressed fears Washington and Moscow will reach agreements without them, and have spent the last weeks trying to amend the US plan so that it does not force Kyiv to capitulate. In Moscow, tensions with Europe were palpable. Putin delivered an exceptionally hawkish statement on Tuesday ahead of meeting the Americans. ‘We are not planning to go to war with Europe, but if Europe wants to and starts, we are ready right now,’ he said. His spokesman on Wednesday accused Europe of being ‘obsessed with inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia’. Moscow has felt emboldened in recent months by the growing pace of its army’s advance in Ukraine. Earlier this week, Russia claimed control of east Ukrainian hub of Pokrovsk. Ukraine on Tuesday said that fighting for the town — which had 60,000 people before Moscow launched its 2022 offensive — was on-going. Moscow on Wednesday claimed another village in the Zaporizhzhia region, where it has also made considerable advances in recent weeks. Russia occupies large swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine. Putin has insisted that Kyiv surrender the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow has claimed as its own for any peace deal to be possible.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/284102/russia-ukraine-prepare-for-more-talks-with-us", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 583},

{"title": "Ending wars and restarting factories", "body": "While industrialisation remains a top priority for Global South countries, debt-driven austerity, corporate dominance, wars and sanctions keep many poorer nations locked into dependency and underdevelopment, writes Vijay Prashad IN MID-NOVEMBER 2025, at a United Nations Industrial Development Organisation conference in Saudi Arabia, Basher Abdullah, an adviser to Sudan’s ministry of industry and trade, said, ‘First, we need to end the war. Then, we have to restart the factories.’ His comment was about Sudan’s appalling civil war, but it could have been about many countries in the global south that are in the midst of either a shooting war or a trade war. For these poorer nations, development has been set aside in favour of more immediate threats. Yet beyond the horizon of guns and extortion lies the need to imagine possible futures. The UNIDO conference acknowledged that industrialisation is ‘essential for achieving the [UNs] Sustainable Development Goals’ and that to do so ‘a new industrial deal’ is needed. A UNIDO policy brief from April 2025 identifies many obstacles to industrialisation in the global south, including deficits in infrastructure, limited technological and scientific capacity, a lack of highly trained workers, and weak logistical networks, including digital infrastructure. The brief also notes ‘megatrends’ that the global south needs to follow and adapt to, such as digitalisation and the rise of artificial intelligence, the reconfiguration of global value chains, the energy transition, and demographic changes. These trends, the brief argues, represent risks as well as opportunities. But where will the poorer nations get the investment for infrastructure, new skills and cleaner industries? How will they be able to leapfrog older, more polluting industrial models and integrate into modern production chains? Conferences like the one in Saudi Arabia rarely reflect on the constraints faced by the poorer nations and the structural deindustrialisation they have experienced. Deindustrialisation in the global south is neither accidental nor the product of ‘internal inefficiencies,’ as International Monetary Fund economists argue. It is a direct result of the third world debt crisis that erupted in the early 1980s and the structural adjustment programmes enforced by the IMF and the World Bank over the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s, for instance, IMF policies forced tariff reductions that exposed Ghana’s textile and garment factories to cheap imports, causing Accra’s once-thriving industrial belt to collapse. In Zambia in the 1990s, SAPs led to the privatisation of industries supplying copper mines, dismantling local fabrication foundries, machine shops, and chemical plants that formed the industrial base in the Copperbelt. In Brazil’s ABC industrial belt south of São Paulo and in the manufacturing corridors of Greater Buenos Aires, debt-era austerity, currency devaluations, and rapid trade liberalisation in the 1980s and 1990s pushed automobile, metalworking and textile plants to shed jobs, close, or relocate as markets were opened to cheaper imports. Across the Global South, peripheral economies that had begun to industrialise were pushed back into a familiar pattern of exporting raw materials and importing manufactures — the very structure of the neocolonial economy. There is also scant attention paid to the violence — of wars and sanctions — that destabilise sovereign states and derail the industrial aspirations of the poorer nations. Conflict destroys industrial infrastructure and fragments and demoralises the working class, both of which are essential to development. Only a few countries in the global south have been able to defend against these assaults on their sovereignty and nurture their industrial capacity. The most remarkable example is Cuba, which has been able to develop its industrial capacity in biotechnology, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals despite a brutal six-decade blockade — a case of socialist industrialisation under siege. Vietnam is another example: despite being devastated by imperialist wars, it was nonetheless able to recover thanks to state-directed industrial policy that built manufacturing capacity in textiles, electronics and shipbuilding. The most successful example, of course, is China, which used state planning, decentralised governance and public ownership of the commanding heights of the economy — including finance and technology — to build an industrial powerhouse and lift 800 million people out of extreme poverty over the past four decades. Taken together, these experiences contradict every neoliberal developmentalist prescription given to the poorer nations of the global south. Industrial policy is not merely a technical exercise but a political one. It is about building the conditions for industrial development by asserting sovereignty and the right to development and by building working-class power through class struggle. A ‘new industrial deal’ cannot be implemented if a country is systematically derailed by IMF-driven austerity, multinational corporations that dominate raw-material extraction and exports and the violence of wars and sanctions. Together, these forces destroy productive infrastructure, shrink state capacity and produce a precarious and politically weakened peasantry and working class, undermining democratic processes and making planning impossible. Unless there is sovereignty, there can be no new industrial deal. Over the past few years, Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research has been elaborating a new development theory for the global south. Within this framework, it has identified the following preconditions for industrialisation: Workers as central planners. Planning must be democratised, as in the Indian state of Kerala, which in 1996 launched the People’s Plan Campaign for Decentralised Planning. Industrialisation cannot be accomplished unless planning includes inputs from workers and peasants’ organisations and other popular bodies rooted in local communities. Restoring sovereignty. Wars must end, sanctions must be lifted and governments must be given the space to build state capacity for long-term planning, including investment in infrastructure, transport and logistics that can link producers and consumers across regions and lower the costs of development. Overcoming dependency. To overcome dependency, state policy must be able to protect domestic industries using tariffs and subsidies, regulate finance through capital controls and ensure technology and knowledge transfer. This will allow countries to move from raw-material-exporting economies to ones grounded in diversified domestic manufacturing. Expanding public ownership. Strategic sectors of the economy — such as land, finance, energy, minerals, transport and capital goods — must be publicly controlled to ensure that they operate for national development rather than private profit. Public sector firms and institutions, as Meng Jie and Zhang Zibin showed with China’s high-technology sector, can compete and create a public market that increases efficiencies. Building south-south cooperation. Countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America must increase cooperation — reviving the Bandung Spirit — in order to break the role of Western monopoly firms and structures in the areas of finance and technology. A decade ago, at the 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Johannesburg, South Africa, the Chinese government and fifty African governments discussed the problem of economic development and industrialisation. Since 1945, the question of African industrialisation has been on the table but has not advanced due to the neocolonial structure that has prevented any serious structural transformation. The most industrialised countries on the African continent are South Africa, Morocco and Egypt, but the entire continent accounts for less than 2 percent of world manufacturing value added and only about 1 percent of global trade in manufactures. That is why it was so significant for FOCAC to put industrial policy at the heart of its agenda; its 2015 Johannesburg Declaration affirmed that ‘industrialisation is an imperative to ensure Africa’s independent and sustainable development.’ China’s industrial capacity would be put at the service of Africa’s need for industrialisation through the creation of joint ventures, industrial parks, a cooperation fund and mechanisms for technology and science transfer. Africa-China trade has increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $282 billion in 2023. In 2024, the Chinese government upgraded its relationship with African states to ‘strategic partnerships,’ enabling greater cooperation. We now have a test case for whether South-South cooperation can engender sovereign industrialisation that breaks with the old patterns of plunder and dependency. Ultimately, African governments, workers, and movements will have to wield these ties as instruments of development rather than allow them to become yet another regime of unequal exchange. At stake in all these debates about industrialisation is a simple question: will the resources of the Global South be used to enrich a few or to sustain life for the many? Reading about FOCAC reminded me of Nigerian poet Niyi Osundare (born 1947), whose book The Eye of the Earth (1986) includes powerful poems about humanity’s relationship with nature. One poem in that collection — ‘Ours to Plough Not to Plunder’ — became so iconic that it was taught to generations of Nigerian schoolchildren, despite repression under the military government that took power in 1983. Here are the last two stanzas: Our earth is an unopened grainhouse, a bustling barn in some far, uncharted jungle a distant gem in a rough unhappy dust. ours to work not to waste ours to man not to maim. This earth is ours to plough, not to plunder. Consortiumnews.com, December 23, 2025. Vijay Prashad is an Indian historian, editor and journalist.

The PMI of Bangladesh was 59.1 points in September, a 0.8-point increase from the previous month, according to the report published on Sunday. This latest PMI reading was attributed to a faster expansion across the key sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services. The agriculture sector posted its 2nd month of expansion, and at a faster rate. The sector posted faster expansion readings for the indexes of new business, business activity, and input costs, and the employment index reverted to an expansion reading. However, the order backlogs index posted a faster rate of contraction, the report added. The manufacturing sector posted its 14th month of expansion, and at a faster rate. The sector posted expansion readings for the indexes of new orders, new exports, factory output, input purchases, finished goods, imports, input prices, employment, and supplier deliveries. However, the order backlogs index posted a faster rate of contraction. According to the PMI report, the construction sector also posted its 2nd month of expansion, and at a faster rate. The sector posted expansion readings for the indexes of new business, construction activity, employment, and input costs. The order backlogs index posted a slower rate of contraction. The services sector posted its 13th month of expansion, and at a faster rate. The sector posted expansion readings for the indexes of new business, business activity, employment, and input costs. The order backlogs index reverted to an expansion reading after 2 months of contraction. In terms of the future business index, slower expansion was recorded across all key sectors—agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and services. M Masrur Reaz, chairman and CEO of Policy Exchange Bangladesh, said that the latest PMI readings indicated that the overall Bangladesh economy continued to expand, primarily driven by favourable crop conditions and expectations of a good harvest in the agricultural sector. ‘Other sectors of the economy also posted faster expansion rates, going into the final quarter of the year, with monthly growth in exports and inflation gradually waning,’ he added. PMI is a survey-based indicator of a sector or country’s business conditions, with monthly surveys that ask respondents to report changes in each variable compared to the prior month.

{"title": "Gaza to Egypt crossing remains shut Israel pushes for hostage remains", "body": "The lifeline Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt remained shut on Wednesday despite reports that it could reopen to aid convoys, as Israel insisted Hamas hand over the remains of the last deceased hostages it holds. Early in the day, Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the crossing point would reopen, but humanitarian sources said this had not happened and a government spokeswoman ignored questions on the subject. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher expressed frustration that the ceasefire, brokered by US president Donald Trump and hailed by world leaders, had yet to facilitate the scale of relief needed in the devastated Palestinian territory. ‘As Hamas have agreed, they must make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of deceased hostages, urgently. I am also gravely concerned by the evidence of violence against civilians in Gaza,’ Fletcher said. ‘As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid — thousands of trucks a week — on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted. We need more crossings open.’ Meanwhile, under the Trump plan endorsed by international mediators, Israel and Hamas are expected to continue their exchange of human remains, which also hit an unexpected obstacle on Wednesday. The swap has seen the last 20 surviving hostages return home in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners freed from Israeli jails, as well as a halt in the fighting and bombardment. So far, Hamas has handed back eight bodies, seven of which have been identified. The remains of 20 others remain in Gaza, and there is domestic pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to tie aid to the fate of the bodies. The eighth — unidentified — body was not that of a former hostage, the Israeli military said after overnight tests, leading some Israeli politicians to accuse Hamas of breaking the ceasefire agreement. Israel’s far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir has threatened to cut off aid supplies to Gaza if Hamas fails to return the remains of soldiers still held in the territory. Israel, meanwhile, transferred another 45 Palestinian bodies that had been in its custody to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, bringing the number handed back to 90, the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry said. Under the Trump plan Israel is to return 15 Palestinian dead for every deceased Israeli hostage. The war sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel led to a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with the densely-populated territory reliant on aid that was heavily restricted, when not cut off outright. At the end of August, the United Nations declared a famine in Gaza, though Israel rejected the claim. The return of aid is listed in Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Another political challenge is Hamas’s disarmament, a demand the militant group has refused to countenance. The group is tightening its grip on the Gaza Strip’s ruined cities, launching a crackdown and executing alleged collaborators with Israel. Hamas has published a video on its official channel showing the summary executions of eight blindfolded and kneeling people, branding them ‘collaborators and outlaws’. The footage, apparently from Monday evening, emerged as armed clashes were underway between Hamas’s various security units and armed Palestinian clans, some alleged to have Israeli backing. In the north of the territory, as Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza City, the Hamas government’s black-masked armed police resumed their patrols. ‘Our message is clear: There will be no place for outlaws or those who threaten the security of citizens,’ a Palestinian security source in Gaza said. Israel and the United States insist Hamas can have no role in a future Gaza government. Trump’s plan says that Hamas members who agree to ‘decommission their weapons’ will be given amnesty. ‘If they don’t disarm, we will disarm them,’ Trump told reporters at the White House a day after visiting the Middle East to celebrate the Gaza ceasefire. ‘And it will happen quickly and perhaps violently.’ Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority representatives are touring Europe to try to convince countries that have not yet recognised a Palestinian state to get on-board, a presidential envoy said during a visit to Switzerland Wednesday. Former Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, currently serving as special envoy for president Mahmud Abbas, told reporters that he had met with Switzerland’s top diplomat to push Bern to join ‘the countries who recognise Palestine’. He said he would be travelling on to the Netherlands and Austria with the same message. ‘Another delegation will be going to the Baltic states, and our president hopefully will visit Italy and Germany,’ he told the briefing, organised by the UN correspondents association ACANU. A majority of European nations now recognise a Palestinian state, following official declarations last month by Britain, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and others against the backdrop of the war in Gaza. A number of non-European states like Australia and Canada have also recently joined their ranks, in moves slammed by Israel. ‘There are 34 countries that did not yet recognise Palestine,’ Shtayyeh said. ‘We are simply in contact with these countries trying to urge them to be part of the countries who recognise Palestine, not part of the countries who did not recognise Palestine.’ In Switzerland, he said he had met with foreign minister Ignazio Cassis.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/279198/gaza-to-egypt-crossing-remains-shut-israel-pushes-for-hostage-remains", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 873},
{"title": "Equity and justice in renewable energy transition", "body": "ENSURING fair access to energy is increasingly recognised as essential for sustainable development, poverty reduction and inclusive growth. In Bangladesh, the focus on who benefits from energy access, who remains underserved and how transitioning to renewables can help address existing inequalities has become more urgent. Bangladesh has made progress in expanding electricity coverage. However, ‘access’ does not mean equity. Significant gaps still exist between urban and rural areas, as well as among wealthier households and low-income communities and between regions with stable infrastructure and those facing recurrent shortages. Rural households often experience lower-quality connections, voltage fluctuations and higher effective costs because solar home systems only meet basic lighting needs. Similarly, low-income groups in peri-urban areas sometimes pay more per unit of electricity through informal sharing arrangements or illegal lines. Industrial zones and wealthy neighbourhoods generally have more reliable electricity due to superior infrastructure, backup generators and political or market influence. In contrast, small businesses, farmers who rely on electric irrigation pumps and informal-sector workers face a greater risk of shortages. These differences highlight deeper social and economic inequalities. Several structural factors reinforce unequal energy access. First, infrastructure development tends to prioritise urban and industrial centres where political attention and investment returns are higher. Rural regions, especially char areas, river islands and remote coastal areas, often suffer from delayed or inadequate grid expansion. Second, even when connections are available, the cost of meters, wiring and monthly bills can be prohibitive for poorer households. Increases in electricity tariffs, driven by rising fuel import costs and reliance on liquid fuel-based power plants, have caused some households to reduce consumption or switch to unsafe alternatives such as kerosene lamps, which pose fire and health risks. Third, limited public participation in energy planning reduces accountability and prevents marginalised communities from influencing decisions that affect them directly. Energy systems are often centrally planned and supply-driven, with little transparency regarding pricing, subsidies, or long-term strategies. These patterns can unintentionally favour groups with stronger political influence or economic power. Renewable energy, especially solar, wind and biomass, has the potential to transform the energy landscape by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and aiding in meeting climate goals. Solar home systems have already supplied lighting to millions of off-grid households and are recognised worldwide as an effective model. However, the renewable sector faces challenges that could threaten social equity if not properly addressed. For example, although they are widely used, solar home systems often only provide basic energy services, which restricts their ability to support economic activities. Large-scale solar parks, while promising for power generation, may lead to land acquisition issues, especially when they are built on cropland or wetlands that support local communities. Without careful planning, renewable energy projects could displace vulnerable populations or create disparities in land ownership and compensation. Furthermore, renewable energy jobs demand new skills; workers at traditional power plants, such as those operating diesel-based local stations, might face job loss if training options are not provided. Therefore, while renewable energy brings environmental benefits and long-term savings, its social impacts must be addressed to ensure fairness. A socially just transition to renewable energy must address both existing inequalities and emerging challenges. Multiple strategies can help create a path that is inclusive, equitable and centred on development. Decentralised renewable technologies such as mini-grids, community solar projects and solar irrigation can provide reliable energy to remote areas where extending the grid is costly or technically difficult. Offering concessional financing, subsidies, or microcredit to poorer households will help overcome affordability barriers. Policies should include mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, community consultations and participatory planning, especially in decisions about land use, pricing and infrastructure expansion. Increased transparency regarding subsidies and tariffs can help reduce perceptions of inequality and build public trust. Large-scale renewable energy projects should be implemented with robust social and environmental safeguards. Compensation packages must be equitable, prompt and easily accessible to impacted communities. Whenever feasible, renewable installations should steer clear of prime agricultural land and instead use marginal lands, rooftops, or water surfaces through floating solar systems. A socially just transition involves helping workers affected by restructuring in the energy sector. Training programs can assist workers from fossil-fuel-dependent industries in gaining new skills in solar installation, maintenance, battery management and energy-efficient technologies. Focusing on youth, women and rural workers in these training efforts can promote greater inclusion. Community-based renewable energy systems, like cooperative solar mini-grids, can increase local empowerment and promote widespread sharing of benefits. These models can reduce reliance on centralised systems and foster a sense of ownership among users, which enhances maintenance and sustainability. Energy equity is crucial to sustainable development because it impacts health, education, productivity and overall human well-being. The transition to renewable energy provides an opportunity to address long-standing inequalities, enhance access and create more resilient energy systems. However, this transition must be carefully planned and executed with a strong focus on justice, ensuring that marginalised communities are included, protected, and empowered. If Bangladesh can balance environmental goals with social fairness, it can move toward a future that is both greener and more equitable.

{"title": "NSU VC underscores role of individuals in fostering peace", "body": "Vice-chancellor of the North South University Professor Abdul Hannan Chowdhury at a seminar at the NSU in Dhaka on Sunday emphasised the vital role of individuals in fostering peace within society and the nation. He also underscored the need to build a more diverse and harmonious community, stressing that humanity must remain the ultimate focus in all efforts toward peace, said a press release. He made the remarks at the seminar on ‘global peace and harmony: Bangladesh’s role in UN peacekeeping’ organised by the NSU Centre for Peace Studies to observe the International Day of Peace 2025. Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support Operation Training commandant Major General Hussain Muhammad Masihur Rahman was present as keynote speaker while retired major general Fazle Elahi Akbar, security adviser to Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia, was present as special guest at the seminar. Panellists from the Bangladesh Army, police and academia enriched the session with their insights. Masihur Rahman highlighted Bangladesh’s legacy and responsibility in UN peacekeeping, stressing, ‘Peace is fundamental to human life yet increasingly scarce in today’s conflict-ridden world.’ He noted that while internal power struggles and rising individualism threatened global harmony, Bangladesh had historically remained a nation of peace, contributing significantly through its armed forces’ sacrifices and humanitarian efforts. Underscoring the resilience of Bangladeshi peacekeepers who endure hardships away from their families, he emphasised, ‘Peacekeeping has strengthened Bangladesh’s global image by winning hearts and minds across missions.’ He urged a shift from being known solely as a ‘country of peacekeepers’ to becoming a ‘nation of peace’, calling for a renewed social contract rooted in humanity and identifying education as the key to sustaining lasting peace, concluding with an appeal for the primacy of humanity and global harmony. During the panel discussion, retired major general Md Main Ullah Chowdhury underscored the growing volatility threatening global peace efforts, noting that peacekeeping remained a source of national pride, soft power and diplomatic credibility for Bangladesh, while also outlining UN peacekeeping structures. Md Akram Hossain, additional inspector general, finance, Bangladesh Police, emphasised that Bangladesh’s peacekeeping role symbolised an uncompromising commitment to peace. Dhaka University international relations teacher Professor Niloy Ranjan Biswas highlighted the rapidly changing peacekeeping landscape, shaped by transnational terrorism, climate-induced resource politics and disinformation warfare. He called for greater digital literacy, specialised training and technological adaptability to secure the future. Sazzad Siddiqui, chairperson of peace and conflict studies at the University of Dhaka, stressed the responsibility of political leadership in peace building. He observed that while democratic peace theory suggested democracies rarely fight each other, current realities showed conflicts between democratic and non-democratic states; nevertheless, he concluded that peace, though challenged by inevitable conflicts, remained achievable. Fazle Elahi Akbar observed that while Bangladesh’s peacekeeping contributions reflected its soft power, soft power alone was not sufficient without hard power. He noted the persistent neglect of defence and foreign policy, stressing that defence, diplomacy, and development must advance in tandem to safeguard national interests. Recalling Bangladesh’s participation in foreign missions, he highlighted that the country not only contributed to peace but also shared its culture of peace globally. He further emphasised that the military should remain outside domestic politics, while receiving due recognition for their sacrifices in protecting Bangladesh’s sovereignty. Professor M Jashim Uddin, director, Centre for Peace Studies, NSU, delivered the inaugural address and moderated the session.

{"title": "25 Interpol red notices sought, 4 issued", "body": "The Bangladesh police in the past one year requested Interpol to issue red notices against 25 people, ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina among them, in connection with crimes against humanity and corruption cases. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation, however, has so far issued red notices for only four people, including former police chief Benajir Ahmed. ‘We sent letters seeking red notices against 25 Bangladesh nationals but Interpol issued red notices against four,’ said AHM Shahadat Hossain, assistant inspector general for media and public relations, at the Police Headquarters in Dhaka city on September 30. The police headquarters data also confirmed that the National Central Bureau of Bangladesh Police requested Interpol to issue red notices against 25 people in the past one year. The people include the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her daughter Saima Wazed, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, former bridges minister Obaidul Quader, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, former liberation war affairs minister AKM Mozammel Haque, former information minister Hasan Mahmud, former textiles and jute minister Jahangir Kabir Nanak, former education minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, former Dhaka South City mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, Hasina’s security adviser retired Major General Tariq Ahmed Siddiq, former state minister for power and energy Nasrul Hamid and former state minister for information and broadcasting Mohammad Ali Arafat. Red notices were also sought against five businesspeople — TNZ Group managing director Shahadat Hossain Shamim, Dard Group chairman Ittemad Uddoulah and managing director Nabil Uddoulah, Roar Fashion Ltd managing directors Mamunul Islam and Uzzwal Hayder. The five are wanted in connection with cases filed with the Labour Court in Gazipur and the two Labour Courts in Dhaka for neglecting workers’ rightful dues and remaining abroad for long periods. The police also sought Interpol red notices against Mohammad Ali, Zebunnesa Akhter and Habib Khan in connection with criminal cases. Interpol has yet not issued red notices any of these 21 people. According to the Bangladesh police headquarters, Interpol issued four red notices, including one against former inspector general of police Benazir Ahmed. The red notice for Benazir came following a request made in February. The Bangladesh police wrote to Interpol after a Dhaka court had ordered them to do so. The court order came following a petition of the Anti-Corruption Commission. The three other red notices were issued in connection with murder cases — two against fugitives Arif Sarkar and Mohsin Mia, and the other against Aowlad Hossain, who is allegedly hiding in Australia facing charges of murder of his wife. Among the four, recently, Mohsin Mia was brought back to the country from Dubai, said police officials. Officials at the police national central bureau also said that they sent the letters to Interpol for red notices as asked by courts, prosecutors or investigation agencies. In November 2024, the Office of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Crimes Tribunal asked the police headquarters to write to Interpol for a red notice against Sheikh Hasina in connection with cases filed with the ICT on charges of crimes against humanity for mass killings during the July uprising. Apart from the 25 people, two Bangladesh courts also ordered authorities concerned to seek Interpol red notice against five more people in connection with graft cases. On September 25, a Dhaka special judge’s court ordered the Anti-Corruption Commission to take initiative for seeking Interpol red notices against S Alam Group chairman Mohammad Saiful Alam and his two brothers in a case filed on charges of embezzling Tk 104.20 crore. The court responded after the ACC had sought its order to seek Interpol assistance through the home ministry to execute arrest warrants against Saiful Alam and his two brothers: S Alam Group vice-chairman Abdus Samad and director Mohammad Abdullah Hasan. Earlier on September 21, a Chattogram court ordered the police headquarters to seek an Interpol red notice against former minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury and his wife Rukmila Zaman in a case filed against 31 people on charges of embezzling and laundering Tk 25 crore from United Commercial Bank. Saifuzzaman served as state minister for land for the period of 2014–2018 and as full minister for the period of 2019–2023.

{"title": "COP30: mirage for climate victims", "body": "FOR countries standing on the frontline of the climate crisis, every annual United Nations climate conference carries a fragile mixture of hope and apprehension. Yet this year’s summit in Belém, COP30, was supposed to be different. Held 10 years after the signing of the Paris Agreement and hosted for the first time in a region synonymous with both planetary salvation and global neglect the Amazon basin it was billed as a turning point. Leader’s spoke of renewal, negotiators promised course correction and civil society prepared for a moment of renewed ambition. But as the conference closed, the sense of disappointment was unmistakable. For millions in climate-vulnerable nations, COP30 resembled not a moment of resurgence but a harsh reminder that the world’s promises continue to fall short when it matters most. From its inception, the Conference of the Parties has been the diplomatic engine of global climate governance. It has produced celebrated milestones from the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, to the entry into force of the convention in 1994, to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015. More recently, COP26 urged a ‘phase-down’ of unabated coal; COP27 created the long-fought-for Loss and Damage Fund; COP28 acknowledged the need to ‘transition away’ from fossil fuels; and COP29 wrestled with formulating the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. Each conference carried its own triumphs and shortcomings. But COP30 was expected to be a different kind of summit, a moment of reckoning where pledges would finally meet the urgency of lived experience. Five major expectations accompanied the lead-up to Belém. First, it was assumed that countries would finally submit refreshed, ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions , as required under the Paris Agreement’s ratchet-up mechanism. These plans were meant to be more comprehensive, addressing not only emissions cuts but also adaptation, finance and loss and damage. Reality, however, painted a different picture. While some countries did submit revised plans, the overall level of ambition was far from what science demands. The world has yet again postponed the hard decisions, leaving the structural deficits in ambition intact. Second, global adaptation efforts were expected to shift decisively from planning to implementation. For years, nations have produced National Adaptation Plans, yet their execution has dragged under the weight of limited financing, inadequate capacity and bureaucratic hurdles. Belém was supposed to mark a new era where adaptation would be treated not as a secondary pillar but as an urgent global priority. The adoption of an indicator framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation was indeed a modest step forward, offering a basis for measuring resilience, vulnerability reduction and adaptive capacity. But without meaningful financial commitments, frameworks remain little more than paper promises. Third, COP30 was anticipated to bring a breakthrough in climate finance. After COP29 formally adopted the New Collective Quantified Goal, developing nations were looking to Belém for a detailed delivery pathway. The scale of global need estimated at $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries alone requires a transformation of the international financial landscape. But the conference stopped short of establishing binding commitments or accountability structures. Instead, it produced a two-year work programme, ensuring that discussions will continue but not guaranteeing that action will follow. For countries already experiencing climate-fuelled disasters that drain their national budgets, this felt less like progress and more like postponement. Fourth, the Loss and Damage Fund was expected to move decisively into operational mode. After the political victory of its creation at COP27, climate-affected nations desperately needed the mechanism to begin delivering tangible support. COP30 did launch the Fund’s first call for proposals, with $250 million available for immediate projects an undeniably important milestone. Yet the amount is a fraction of what is needed. For countries witnessing disappearing coastlines, collapsing ecosystems and communities repeatedly displaced by cyclones or droughts, the allocation felt symbolic rather than transformative. The broader questions how the Fund will be scaled, governed and kept accountable remain only partially addressed. Finally, the tenth anniversary of the Paris Agreement demanded a broader shift from negotiation to implementation, from rhetoric to results. Climate diplomacy has matured, but climate action has not kept pace. COP30 needed to reinforce the integrity of the multilateral system while empowering local actors, institutions, and community-level resilience. Despite renewed calls for capacity-building and locally led adaptation, the outcomes of Belém did little to change the balance of power or resources between global institutions and vulnerable communities. To be fair, COP30 was not devoid of positive developments. The decision to triple adaptation finance by 2035, though delayed and diluted, provides at least a directional signal. The Belém Mechanism for Just Global Transition offers a new platform for cooperation, technical support and knowledge-sharing. The recognition of nature-based solutions and the links between public health and climate impacts was long overdue. And progress on adaptation indicators gives countries a clearer framework for reporting and accountability. These achievements should not be dismissed. Yet the fundamental truth remains: the gains do not match the scale of the crisis. For climate-vulnerable nations like Bangladesh, small island states, drought-stricken African countries and communities in the world’s deltaic and coastal regions-the outcomes of COP30 simply do not reflect the urgency of the moment. The distance between scientific warnings and political commitments is widening, not narrowing. Bangladesh stands as a stark example. Rising sea levels, recurrent cyclones, salinity intrusion, river erosion and extreme heat have already reshaped livelihoods and economic security. Every year of inaction pushes millions closer to displacement, economic loss and irreversible environmental degradation. For countries like Bangladesh, climate conferences are not diplomatic rituals, they are existential negotiations. And when these negotiations yield incremental progress instead of systemic change, the sense of betrayal runs deep. COP30 was meant to serve as a turning point. Instead, it exposed once more the fragility of global solidarity. The world’s most climate-vulnerable nations came seeking security, justice and a credible path forward. What they received was a mixture of half-measures and delayed promises. For them, COP30 was not just a missed opportunity, it was a shattered dream.

{"title": "Ungrounded arguments must not harm Dhaka Central Univ process", "body": "THE Dhaka Central University that the government is working to establish to resolve the long-drawn problems of seven colleges affiliated, in the latest round, to the University of Dhaka appears to have been mired in ungrounded arguments that the students, even the ones still in higher secondary education, and teachers of the colleges have put up. Before the affiliation of the colleges to the University of Dhaka was cancelled in January 2025 with the students having been unwilling to continue with the university, the National University, an affiliating collegiate university founded in 1992, had governed them since. As the National University could not cope with a large number of students, the seven colleges were put back under the University of Dhaka in February 2017 keeping to a 2014 decision. As the long-drawn issue resurfaced towards the end of 2024, the government worked on a separate university named the Dhaka Central University with the admission for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 academic sessions to resolve the issues that the colleges — Begum Badrunnessa Government Girls’ College, Dhaka College, Eden Girls’ College, Government Bangla College, Government Shaheed Suhrawardy College, Government Titumir College and Kabi Nazrul Government College. With the progress having run further towards a meaningful resolution, the teachers of the seven colleges at protests on respective campuses. The government is working on the new university, with 35–40 per cent of the classes online. The remaining classes and examinations would be held in person. The proposed university will hold science faculty using the infrastructure of the Dhaka College, Eden Girls’ College and Badrunnessa Girls’ College after college hours. Humanities faculty classes will take place at the Government Bangla College, business faculty classes at Titumir College and law and justice faculty classes at Suhrawardy College and Kabi Nazrul College. The administrative building, a teacher-student centre, an auditorium and a health centre will be built on separate locations. The teachers, banded under the BCS General Education Association, put forth a set of 11 demands, which include the incorporation of general education cadre members in all administrative and teaching positions of the proposed university, no new department, no exclusion of any department that the colleges run, no change in the ownership of the college assets and the like. Whilst these are affairs for the proposed university, which would only use the college infrastructure, and its managers to decide, it appears that the college teachers and college students who are in their tertiary education or would step in there are confused about the structure and functioning of the university.

It must, rather, proceed with its plan as early as it can to resolve the long-standing problems of the students of the seven colleges.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/277123/ungrounded-arguments-must-not-harm-dhaka-central-univ-process", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 467},

{"title": "The politics of renaming in post-uprising Bangladesh", "body": "IN BANGLADESH, mainstream political parties have long used the naming of institutions as a way to stake their claim to history and assert ownership over the country. As a result, major public institutions often undergo cycles of naming and renaming with each change of government. In the past, this practice has also reflected acts of sycophancy — for example, when a local leader extorts money from bazaars and toll plazas, builds a small bridge over connecting canals, and proposes naming it after the local member of parliament. Yet, never before has this politics of (re)naming been as ideologically charged as it has become in post-July uprising Bangladesh. After coming to power, the Awami League government changed the name of Zia International Airport to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. Our familiar leisure destination, Zia Udyan, became Chandrima Udyan, and the Maulana Bhasani Novo Theatre was renamed Bangabandhu Novo Theatre. After the fall of the authoritarian Awami League regime in August 2024, students and the public, and in some cases, even the administration itself, removed the names of the deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her family members from various installations. I write this piece as a note of dissent to this particular politics of renaming. I write this piece to say that, in the name of reclaiming history from the strict grip of the Awami League, certain political forces are trying to erase women, write history along sectarian lines and undermine the history of the Liberation War of 1971. In February, following a speech by Sheikh Hasina from her exile in India, which was widely circulated on social media, incidents at Begum Rokeya University, Rajshahi University, Khulna University, and Chittagong University have drawn particular attention. Many students at Begum Rokeya University are well known for their social and cultural engagement. This is the university of Shaheed Abu Sayeed, martyred during the July Uprising. Unhesitatingly, he embraced death with courage and tore down Sheikh Hasina’s fortress of oppression. However, a group of students, on no justified ground and with some vested interest, have demanded the university’s name be changed to Rangpur University and Begum Rokeya’s name be removed. Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880–1932) was a pioneering Bengali writer and social reformer who championed women’s education and rights. She founded the first school for Muslim girls in Bengal and authored the feminist classic Sultana’s Dream. Thankfully, the demand was not welcomed by the larger academic and student community at Begum Rokeya University. They are proud to carry on the legacy of Begum Rokeya. At Rajshahi University, on the night of February 5, when male students went to a female dormitory carrying banners to remove the name of a family member of Sheikh Mujib, female students protested this aggressive act of renaming. The situation escalated into verbal abuse, slut-shaming, and even physical assault — one video circulating online shows male students throwing clothing at a female student. Meanwhile, the controversy over renaming at Khulna University has unravelled another communal aspect of renaming. An administrative notice revealed that names of buildings and facilities honouring the deposed prime minister and her family were changed — but so were those named after martyred intellectuals and cultural icons such as Professor GC Deb, Lalon Sai, Dr Satyendranath Bose, Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose, Jibanananda Das, Syed Nazrul Islam, Dr Alim Chowdhury, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray, Dr Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta, and Dr Sukh Ranjan Samaddar. The administration justified their action by claiming that no one recognised the facilities by those names and that naming small residential quarters after such figures actually diminished their honour. Whether that reasoning is acceptable is debatable — but the public narrative that has emerged is deeply unsettling for a post-uprising university administration. The situation at Chittagong University has been even more alarming. Following a dispute over the removal of a boat symbol (the Awami League’s electoral emblem) from a women’s dormitory, verbal altercations and even physical scuffles broke out between teachers, journalists, and students. The university proctor and assistant proctor have been accused of verbally abusing female students, calling them ‘agents of the autocrat’, ‘Hasina’s lackeys’, and other misogynistic slurs. One student was accused of physically assaulting a teacher. Eventually, the university administration expelled 11 female students after an internal investigation. Serious allegations have emerged that the investigation lacked due process — at least nine students were expelled without a fair hearing; some were punished simply for writing about the incident on Facebook, not for any on-site involvement. The university’s online groups are now filled with misogynistic comments about the female students. On social media, the university’s own proctor has indirectly accused female students of engaging in ‘honey traps’. In addition, several of his moral-policing posts at different times have also resurfaced. Let us not forget, when Sheikh Hasina was still in power, firing bullets, arresting and prosecuting protesters, it was our young women who first dared to erase her name on July 34 (August 3, 2024), in Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh University of Textile, and Cumilla University. The female students of these universities dared to remove fascist Sheikh Hasina’s name from their dormitories, naming the dormitories after powerful women from history and announcing it publicly. Needless to say, their act of courage — and the agency it represents — has unsettled certain quarters. The political forces trying to erase these women from history are betraying the dream and aspiration for a future of Bangladesh founded on the ethos of equality and justice. I am not suggesting that this politics of renaming in the context of public universities is something new in Bangladesh’s history. In 1999, the syndicate of Shahjalal University of Science and Technology decided to name a female dormitory Jahanara Imam Hall. The local leaders of Jamat-e-Islam and its student wing, Chhatra Shibir, protested vehemently, forcing the decision to be suspended. During those protests, a Shibir activist named Abdul Munim Belal was killed by Bangladesh Rifles (now Border Guard Bangladesh) gunfire. Writers like Humayun Ahmed and Anisuzzaman went on hunger strike demanding that the dormitory be named after Jahanara Imam. The university remained closed for a long time, and in 2000, the then-president issued a stay order. The hall was renamed First Ladies Hall. Later, a foundation stone was laid for a sculpture to be titled Mother and Child of the Freedom Fighters. In January 2013, a committee was formed to construct it, but right-wing religious groups again protested under the guise of ‘local community’, arguing that sculptures or the art of public sculpture violate Islamic religious values. The project was abandoned. On September 25, the SUST syndicate announced new names for several dormitories. Unsurprisingly, the long-promised Jahanara Imam Hall did not materialise. The former First Ladies Hall has now been renamed Ayesha Siddiqa Hall, and the other two female dormitories are now Fatimah Tuz Zahra Hall and Sumaiya Binte Khabbat Hall. A male dormitory was named Gazi Burhanuddin Hall, and the international student hostel M. Saifur Rahman International Hostel. By erasing the memory of Sylhet’s rich cultural and liberation history, the SUST administration has chosen to wave the flag of another kind of politics. Sylhet is, after all, the land of 360 saints — of Shahjalal and Shah Paran. It is also the land of mystic poets and folk bards. I was born and raised here. In this land, thousands of Hindu families like mine still pray every year at the shrines of Shahjalal and Shah Paran. Sylhet is the home of Shah Abdul Karim and Radha Raman, a key organiser of our struggle for independence, Suhasini Das, liberation war commander-in-chief MAG Osmani, pioneer of women’s education Hosne Ara, martyr Jagatjyoti Das, and Ekushey Padak-winning folk artist Sushama Das. A SUST student named Rudra Sen was martyred during the July mass uprising. Yet, not one of these names — not even their own martyr’s — occurred to the SUST administration while renaming. Why has the university administration adopted such a communal naming policy? Who objected to Jahanara Imam’s name? Ayesha Siddiqa, Fatimah Tuz Zahra, and Sumaiya Binte Khabbat are undoubtedly revered figures — but what is their contribution to our region, our culture, or our history? If universities are made to appear misogynistic, anti-Liberation, and anti-Hindu, whose politics does that serve? No uprising is ever the work of a single gender, community, or religion. The July Uprising was not led by men or people of any particular religion or political party alone. The July 36 would not have been possible without the participation of countless women, students, teachers, artists, workers, and other ordinary citizens. Moreover, the uprising was never in conflict with the Liberation War; rather, it drew its strength from the ideals of 1971. Then why are post-uprising university administrations and other government bodies now behaving in ways that serve anti-liberation, misogynistic, and communal narratives? Perhaps, intoxicated by newfound power, they are helping restore the very discourse of the fallen autocrat by establishing an environment of misogyny and communal tensions. It is now their burden to prove otherwise.

Ukrainian railways CEO Oleksandr Pertsovsky also warned that Russian drone strikes were becoming more precise, complicating Kyiv’s ability to fend off incoming attacks. Russia launched drones at two passenger trains in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region on Saturday, killing one person and wounding dozens, according to Ukrainian officials. ‘We clearly see the intensification of enemy attacks on the railway infrastructure,’ Pertsovsky told reporters, including AFP. ‘There is no military purpose whatsoever. The only purpose is to sow panic among people... that the connection will be destroyed and people will be left alone,’ he said. Speaking via video call while on a train to Shostka, the station that was hit, he said there had been ‘40 major attacks’ on railway infrastructure since August, ‘pretty much every other day’. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky called Saturday’s attack, which occurred around 50 kilometres from the Russian border, ‘savage’. He posted a video showing a mangled train carriage engulfed in flames with twisted metal and busted windows. ‘The Russians could not have been unaware that they were striking civilians,’ he said. Russia’s army has repeatedly targeted Ukraine’s railways since invading in February 2022. Pertsovsky said there had not been a single week of the war without this occurring. In April 2022, more than 60 people waiting to evacuate the frontline city of Kramatorsk were killed when a Russian missile crashed into the busy station there. Pertsovsky expressed particular concern about Russian weapons becoming more precise, saying that without effective air defence, ‘it’s unfortunately very easy to imagine that a similar attack could bring way, way worse results’. ‘They have very precise Shaheds [Iranian-designed drones] that are targeting individual locomotives; they are able also to target energy infrastructure very effectively, making many of the tools that were used for protection ineffective at the moment,’ he said. Russia has also stepped up its attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as the weather chills. Moscow earlier this week launched its largest-ever strike on Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, while strikes on Saturday cut off power to some 50,000 households in the northern Chernigiv region.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/278045/russia-intensifies-strikes-on-ukraine-railways", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 371},

Relations had deteriorated following Canadian accusations that New Delhi was involved in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh leader – claims India denied. The diplomatic rift severely disrupted consular and trade services between the nations, which exchanged about $9 billion in goods and services in 2023. Relations have improved since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took office in March. Carney met Modi in June, on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, where they agreed to name new high commissioners, as ambassadors are known between Commonwealth nations. Both envoys have since begun work. With US President Donald Trump upending global trade, both India and Canada have been much more agreeable about working together. Anand is also expected to meet India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal and meet business leaders in the financial capital Mumbai. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside India. That community includes activists for ‘Khalistan’, a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority. Ottawa accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan campaigner, and targeting other Sikh activists connected to the movement. The Khalistan campaign dates to India’s 1947 independence and has been blamed for the assassination of a prime minister and the bombing of a passenger jet.

{"title": "Hundreds protest violence against women in Mexico", "body": "Hundreds of women protested in Mexico City on Tuesday against gender-based violence, which kills an average of 10 women or girls every day in Mexico, according to official data. Mexican lawyer Alejandra Perez said she lives in fear every day since the violence she faced from her ex-partner temporarily left her disabled. But the 37-year-old summoned the courage to join the protest to denounce the impunity of many perpetrators of gender-based violence in Mexico, and marched holding a poster showing the man she accuses of attacking her. ‘I filed a complaint against him three years ago, and this man is still at large,’ she said of her daughter’s father. ‘The system is very slow. Unfortunately many women have to conduct their own investigations.’ The United Nations reports that 70 per cent of Mexican women over the age of 15 have experienced some form of aggression at least once in their lives. Mexican parliamentary records indicate 3,430 women died violent deaths in Mexico in 2024, with 829 victims of femicide, a crime defined as murder motivated by a victim’s gender. Mexico is experiencing a wave of feminist fervour fuelled by anger over the high number of assaults and the impunity of perpetrators. President Claudia Sheinbaum recently launched a nationwide drive against sexual harassment and abuse, after a shocking video of a man groping her brought the widespread issue into stark focus. The country’s first woman leader presented a plan to ensure prison sentences for sexual abuse across Mexico and to encourage women to report incidents to police. The 63-year-old leader was accosted as she walked through Mexico City when a seemingly drunk man put his arm around her shoulder, touched her hip and chest, and attempted to kiss her neck, before a member of the president’s security detail pulled him away.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/latin-america/283359/hundreds-protest-violence-against-women-in-mexico", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 300},

The launch, which included an unveiling of the match schedule, saw some speakers struggle to be heard as a small but noisy pro-Palestine protest took place directly outside the event, with demonstrators chanting against Israel’s continued membership of UEFA, the governing body of European football. Organisers announced England would open their campaign at the Etihad before playing their final two group games at London’s Wembley Stadium if they qualify directly. England would play at Newcastle’s St James’ Park if they won Group B, before returning to Wembley for the rest of the tournament, with the national stadium set to stage one quarter-final, both semi-finals and the final, which will be held on July 9. The final was confirmed as a 5pm local (1600 GMT) kick-off -- three hours earlier than the Euro 2020 final at Wembley which became infamous for the chaotic scenes outside the stadium as ticketless supporters tried to force entry. If England, who have not won a major men’s international football tournament since beating the then West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley, finish second in the group they will travel head to Everton’s Hill Dickinson Stadium for the last 16, before going on to the Principality Stadium. Wales are set to open the tournament at the Cardiff venue on June 9. Nine stadiums in eight cities will stage the tournament, with Villa Park and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium the other Premier League venues involved. England and Wales could meet in a Wembley quarter-final if both teams win their groups. The four hosts will enter qualification, but there will be two places reserved for any that fail to either win their group or finish as one of the eight best runners-up. Debbie Hewit, the chair of both England’s Football Association and UK and Ireland 2028 Ltd, promised the ‘best-ever’ Euro, with UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin saying: ‘The host nations, where the game first took shape, are eager to welcome millions of fans into legendary stadiums, providing the right stage for a festival of emotions, vividly encapsulated in the design we presented today.’ An independent assessment estimated the tournament will generate £3.6 billion ($4.7 billion) in socio-economic benefit between 2028 and 2031.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/282066/england-set-for-etihad-start-to-euro-2028", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 413},

{"title": "Western Marine hands over three landing craft to UAE buyer", "body": "Western Marine Shipyard Limited on Thursday handed over three newly built landing craft vessels to Marwan Shipping Ltd of the United Arab Emirates, marking another step forward for Bangladesh’s growing export-oriented shipbuilding industry. The vessels Maya, Emy and Muna were formally delivered at a ceremony held aboard the newly built landing craft Maya on the Karnaphuli River in Chattogram. In 2023, Western Marine signed a contract with Marwan Shipping Ltd to construct eight vessels, including two tugboats, four landing craft and two tankers. With Thursday’s handover, the company has so far delivered four vessels under the agreement, following the earlier delivery of the landing craft Rayan in January and tugboats Khalid and Ghaya in July this year. Speaking at the event, UAE ambassador to Bangladesh Abdullah Ali Abdullah Al Hamoudi said the commercial ties between the two companies would further strengthen the longstanding friendship between the two nations and he hoped more ships from Bangladesh would be exported to the UAE in the future. Abdur Rahim Khan, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Commerce and administrator of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said shipbuilding had added a new dimension to the country’s export basket as both the public and private sectors became increasingly engaged in the industry. Western Marine’s steady record of exporting vessels over the recent years was contributing to the economy, employment generation and diplomatic relations with friendly countries, he added. He also said that Bangladesh is among a very small number of countries capable of building such large vessels. The country would soon be able to export even bigger ships to the global market. Marwan Shipping and Trading Company LLC managing director Ahmed Mohammed Hussein Al Marzouki, Chattogram Range DIG Ahsan Habib, officials from the Coast Guard and other agencies were also present at the ceremony. The landing craft will be used to transport equipment for offshore energy operations, according to officials at the event. Since its establishment, Western Marine Shipyard has exported 36 vessels to 11 countries, with a combined market value of $138 million.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/282743/western-marine-hands-over-three-landing-craft-to-uae-buyer", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 343},
{"title": "Haaland fires City up to second in Premier League", "body": "Erling Haaland scored twice to propel Manchester City up to second in the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Bournemouth on Sunday. The Cherries started the day in second thanks to the longest unbeaten run in the English top flight. But Andoni Iraola's side were undone by the scintillating form of the Norwegian striker, who took his tally to 13 Premier League goals in 10 games. Haaland's relentless streak is maintaining City's title challenge as they reduced the gap to leaders Arsenal back to six points and edged one point ahead of Liverpool, who they face next weekend. ‘Important win,’ said Haaland. ‘It's good to bounce back after losing a bad away game. It was nice. I tried to contribute for the team by doing my job and we won again.’ Despite a first defeat in 10 games away to Aston Villa last weekend, Pep Guardiola remained confident his side can pose a threat to Arsenal come May. There were more encouraging signs for Guardiola as Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden shone in creative roles, while Nico O'Riley became the first City player other than Haaland to score in the Premier League for over a month. ‘Bournemouth are one of the most demanding teams that we have faced,’ said Guardiola. ‘We found our rhythm and today we were better in many aspects.’ Buoyed by their unbeaten streak since losing at Liverpool on the opening night of the season, Bournemouth started brightly. However, their brave high line was exposed on 17 minutes when Cherki's header allowed Haaland to gallop clear from inside his own half to slam past Djordje Petrovic. The visitors levelled eight minutes later when Gianluigi Donnarumma claimed he was impeded as the Italian tried to collect a corner and Tyler Adams thrashed home the loose ball. But Haaland restored City's advantage before half-time by racing onto another Cherki pass in behind the Bournemouth defence to round Petrovic and slot home his 26th goal for club and country this season. The 25-year-old also became only the third player to ever score multiple goals in four consecutive Premier League home games after Luis Suarez and Robbie Fowler. Guardiola has called for greater contributions from his other attacking players to lessen the goalscoring burden on his prolific number nine. Still no City player other than Haaland has scored more than once in the league this season, but O'Riley chipped in from full-back to seal the three points. Foden was the creator this time as O'Riley strode forward before arrowing a low shot into the far corner. Haaland was denied the chance of a hat-trick as he was replaced by Omar Marmoush eight minutes from time with one eye on facing his former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday. ‘You need to ask Pep for this,’ added Haaland. ‘I think there are probably a few fantasy (football) managers that were not so happy when I got subbed off!’ A double was enough to keep City still within range despite Arsenal's rampant run of nine consecutive wins and seven straight clean sheets in all competitions.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/281022/haaland-fires-city-up-to-second-in-premier-league", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 516},

Various political parties and socio-cultural organisations held separate programmes to honour the occasion. To mark the day, Bhashani Janashakti Party organised a discussion meeting at the National Press Club with party chairman Sheikh Rafiqul Islam Bablu in chair. Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jatiya Party faction chairman Mostafa Jamal Haider, among others, spoke at the event.

Bhashani Onusari Parishad and several other organisations also paid their respects. Maulana Bhashani was born in 1880 in Dhanpara village of Sirajganj. His father Haji Sharafat Ali Khan sent him to a local school and madrassah. Bhashani entered politics at a young age, dedicating his life to the welfare of the common people. He taught at a primary school in Kagmari of Tangail and later taught at a madrassah in Kala village of Haluaghat in Mymensingh. Known as the ‘Majlum Jananeta’ (leader of the downtrodden), Bhashani was renowned for his stand against imperialism and oppression by the Pakistani regime. He also served as the chairman of the All-Party Action Committee during the War of Independence. Bhashani led the historic Farakka Long March, advocating for Bangladesh’s rightful share of the Ganges River water.

{"title": "CU proctor resigns amid student protest", "body": "Chittagong University proctor Professor Dr Tanvir Mohammad Hayder Arif resigned from his post on Sunday following student protests. Professor Dr Hossain Shaid Shohrowardhy of the marketing department was appointed as his successor. The resignation comes in the aftermath of violent clashes between the university’s students and local villagers in August 30–31 following which the proctorial body was accused of being grossly negligent about their responsibilities. Several student organisations demanded the proctor to resign, while nine students staged a hunger strike on the campus from September 10, pressing for the removal of the proctorial body along with six other demands. The strike ended after 52 hours upon assurances from the vice-chancellor Dr Muhammad Yeahia Akhter. On Sunday at around 2:30pm, Professor Tanvir Mohammad Hayder Arif announced his resignation at a press conference in front of the proctor’s office. Expressing satisfaction over being able to spend one full year as proctor, he said at a press conference, ‘Completing one year is a historic event because no previous proctors could complete their term.’ ‘From my personal experience, I can say that no proctorial body should serve for a full year. One year is a very long time. In our country, there are still no proper arrangements for the proctorial body,’ remarked the professor. Asked whether he was resigning due to the movement, he said, ‘We took responsibility for one year. That one year has now been completed.’ He was not willing to extend his tenure, he said, adding, ‘whether others will extend theirs is their personal matter.’ Later, an office order signed by acting registrar Professor Saiful Islam stated that Professor Dr Hossain Shaid Shohrowardhy had been appointed as proctor for a one-year term, with entitlement to all allowances and facilities as per university regulations. The order will take effect from September 23 afternoon, according to the office order. Meanwhile, outgoing proctor Tanvir Mohammad Hayder Arif has been appointed as director of the university’s Research, Publication and Operation Office. Acting registrar Dr Mohammed Saiful Islam said, ‘As the tenure of the previous proctor has ended, Professor Shohrowardhy has been appointed as the new proctor.’ Professor Arif was appointed as proctor on September 22 past year. During his tenure, he faced repeated criticisms, including when in February this year students demanded his removal over ‘indecent’ remarks about female students on social media. Allegations of his close links with Islami Chhatra Shibir further intensified anger among student organisations, including Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dal, which intensified calls for his resignation. Clashes broke out between CU students and local villagers on the nights of August 30 and 31 after which a section of students accused the proctorial body of negligence. Jatiotabadi Chhatra Dal’s Chittagong University unit also demanded the proctor’s resignation, alleging his close ties with Islami Chhatra Shibir.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/276796/cu-proctor-resigns-amid-student-protest", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 461},
{"title": "EU agrees recycled plastic targets for cars", "body": "Car manufacturers in Europe will have to include more recycled plastics in new vehicles under new EU rules agreed on by the bloc’s countries and lawmakers on Friday. European Union governments and parliament representatives reached an early morning deal to mandate that at least 25 per cent of plastics used in cars, trucks and motorcycles has been recycled. Carmakers will have to meet the mandatory target in 10 years, with an intermediate 15 per cent goal in six years, according to the European Council representing member states. At least 20 per cent of the recycled materials will have to be sourced from old, scrap vehicles. ‘This provisional agreement marks a significant step towards a circular economy for the European automotive sector,’ said Magnus Heunicke, environment minister for Denmark, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency. Vehicle manufacturing accounts for 10 per cent of the EU’s overall consumption of plastics, and is responsible for 19 per cent of demand for the bloc’s steel industry, according to Brussels. The deal is provisional and needs to be officially endorsed by the European Council representing member states and the parliament before it is formally adopted. It also instructs the European Commission to set future targets for recycled steel, aluminium, magnesium and critical raw materials and bans the export of old vehicles that are no longer roadworthy. Around 3.5 million vehicles ‘disappear without trace from EU roads’ every year and are exported, dismantled or disposed of illegally, according to the council. The commission had initially proposed a much speedier implementation of the targets — pushing for 25-per cent recycled plastic within six years — but member states and parliament won a delay during negotiations. Concerns about sluggish European growth have taken precedence over green ambitions in Brussels over the past year, leading to a business-friendly drive to slash EU red tape and pare back a slew of laws. ‘This deal is a textbook case of political backsliding under industry pressure,’ said Fynn Hauschke, of environmental group EEB. The agreement comes just days before the commission is set to review a landmark 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. On Thursday, Manfred Weber, a German EU lawmaker and the head of parliament’s largest group, the EPP, said the ban would be discarded in favour of a 90 per cent emission reduction target. ‘For new registrations from 2035 onwards, a 90 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions will now be mandatory for car manufacturers’ fleet targets, instead of 100 per cent,’ he told German tabloid Bild, after a meeting with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. ‘This means that the technology ban on combustion engines is off the table. All engines currently built in Germany can therefore continue to be produced and sold.’ Commission officials stressed however that no final decision had been made.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/automobile/284991/eu-agrees-recycled-plastic-targets-for-cars", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 468},

{"title": "Demands grow for refund of taxes", "body": "Tourism businesses have long demanded that airlines refund the taxes passengers paid on unused non-refundable air tickets. A similar demand has also been echoed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, which urged the National Board of Revenue and Bangladesh Bank to take necessary steps in this regard. In a recent letter, the ministry urged the NBR to take necessary steps so that passengers who fail to travel after purchasing a non-refundable air ticket can get back the tax amounts they paid. Passengers usually purchase both refundable and non-refundable air tickets for domestic and international air travel. ‘As per the refund policies of different airlines, passengers who fail to travel on the scheduled date and time are entitled to a partial refund in the case of refundable tickets, while no refund is allowed for non-refundable tickets,’ the letter added. When a passenger does not travel after purchasing a ticket, the ticket remains unused. In such cases, there is an obligation to refund the portion of the fare paid as taxes to the passenger or customer, the letter said. ‘It has been observed that airlines often do not refund the tax amount on unused non-refundable tickets, causing financial loss to passengers and giving rise to disputes between customers and travel agencies regarding refunds,’ the ministry said. However, an airline official denied the allegations and said that they usually refund the tax amount to passengers upon request. The letter stated that when travel does not occur, there is no scope for the tax amount to be deposited as government revenue. To prevent revenue leakage, protect consumer rights, and resolve disputes between travel agencies and customers, it is necessary to establish a clear directive requiring airlines to refund the tax portion of unused non-refundable air tickets when passengers fail to travel, the letter added. The ministry also urged the authorities to take appropriate measures and issue specific instructions to the airlines to ensure the refund of the tax amount paid by passengers for unused non-refundable tickets on both domestic and international routes. ATAB leaders said that they have been working on the issues for a long time, but have yet to reach a solution. Speaking to New Age, Abdus Salam Aref, former president of the ATAB, said they had always urged the concerned authorities to recover the tax amount from non-refundable air tickets. ‘The airlines are reluctant in this regard. They have to take action as they don’t have any bindings to submit the taxed amounts to the state coffer against the unused tickets,’ he added. He also said that if an airline sells around 1,000 tickets and 50 remain unused for various reasons, the company would recognise revenue only for the flown tickets. When asked what NBR could do there, he said that NBR could ask companies to submit full lists of sold and flown tickets, and then instruct airlines to issue the taxed amount of non-refundable tickets to passengers. An official of the NBR said they were working on the issues and trying to find a way to resolve them. A senior official of US-Bangla Airlines said that they would refund the tax amount to passengers who miss a flight upon their claims for non-refundable tickets. ‘There might be any misunderstanding on the issues; we usually refund the taxed amount. If the passengers do not travel, then there is no reason for him to pay the tax,’ he added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/280287/demands-grow-for-refund-of-taxes", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 569},
{"title": "The unfinished promise of victory", "body": "BANGLADESH is no longer an object of anyone’s neglect. Half a century ago, the world looked upon this land through a mixture of pity and predicted failure, as if the newly liberated nation were destined to remain buried beneath the rubble left by genocide, famine, poverty and structural destruction. Today, when Bangladesh celebrates Victory Day, it stands among the very few nations that won independence not as a gift of history but through the deliberate choice of war. After the United States, Bangladesh is the only other country whose birth was declared through a proclamation of independence and then realised through armed struggle. Yet, this extraordinary triumph came at a cost so immense that no measure of progress can ever fully repay it. The soil of this country is not just soil; it is a cemetery of unmarked graves and a repository of the silent cries of children, women and men who never saw the light of an independent dawn. Victory Day invariably invites pride, but it also provokes a certain ache of conscience. As the diamond jubilee approaches, the nation cannot help but return to that haunting question voiced repeatedly in the early years of independence: how did this unlikely country defy every prediction of failure? The most unflattering observers of the 1970s, including some of the world’s top economists, held the patronising view that if Bangladesh could solve its economic challenges, then any country in the world could develop. The implication was clear: Bangladesh was beyond hope. Yet five decades later, the numbers speak with quiet confidence. Economic output has multiplied more than seventy times. Per capita income has increased fifteen-fold. Electrification has reached millions. Access to clean water has expanded across rural and urban communities. Life expectancy has risen dramatically. Education has spread, though its quality continues to be a painful concern. These achievements are neither accidental nor trivial. They are the results of generations determined to prove, through sheer human resilience, that the country born of blood could stand upright among nations. Still, the pride must remain tempered by honesty. If achievements illuminate the horizon like lanterns floating upward into a clear night sky, failures rest like shadows beneath them. No one is unaware of the statistics of graft, inefficiency and structural injustice. Public money continues to disappear through waste and corruption. In development budgets, nearly a third is believed to be lost before any progress reaches the ground, an erosion that amounts not only to economic damage but to a betrayal of the nation’s founding blood. If even half of this loss were prevented, Bangladesh could build a fourth more schools, hospitals, roads and power stations. The theft of public wealth is not simply a crime; it is an assault on the very soul of independence. Patriotism is not measured by how loudly one celebrates Victory Day, but by how sincerely one protects the resources of the people. In the financial sector, the wounds are deeper still. The banking system is burdened with defaulted loans amounting to the terrifying scale of lakhs of crores of taka. A quiet bleeding continues as defaulters, cronies and looters use their wealth and influence to evade accountability. Liquidity crises haunt institutions that were meant to support the nation’s development. Such failures demand not rhetorical condemnation but ethical courage. If the country is to honour its martyrs, it must ensure that corruption is not allowed to hollow out the dream they died for. Victory Day must therefore serve as a solemn reminder that the liberation earned through collective sacrifice can be lost through individual greed. The question that runs like an undercurrent beneath this national narrative is whether the new generations fully comprehend the depth of the sacrifice that created Bangladesh. Today’s youth, surrounded by technology, global connectivity and expanding economic opportunities, must also recognise that every privilege they enjoy rests upon an ocean of blood. The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard once argued that life can only be understood backwards, though it must be lived forwards. Bangladesh embodies this paradox. The nation lives forward in ambition, innovation and development, but it must continually look backward to find moral clarity. Only by accepting this dual gaze can the country fulfil what Rabindranath Tagore described in Gitanjali as the obligation ‘to awaken the soul of a nation slumbering in the dust.’ To understand that soul, one must return to the human dimension of the Liberation War. History books offer the panoramic view of battles, strategies and political decisions. But the true texture of that struggle lies in the personal stories often lost in the footnotes. Ordinary villagers who sheltered fighters at the risk of certain death. Transport workers who smuggled arms concealed beneath sacks of rice. Teachers who used their schools as secret meeting points. Women who carried coded messages across checkpoints. Mothers who cooked for dozens of fighters knowing the Pakistan army could appear at any moment. Girls who hid families in their huts after their homes had been razed. Each act, no matter how small, added a thread to the tapestry of victory. Yet so many of these heroes remain unrecognised. Their names do not appear in history books. Their graves are unmarked. The nation owes them an overdue remembrance. To revisit the liberation war is also to revisit its cultural memory. The war was not merely fought with rifles; it was carried on the currents of songs, poems and artistic defiance. Music became both armour and sanctuary. The patriotic anthems broadcast from the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra travelled across fields and rivers like whispers of freedom. Poems by Shamsur Rahman and Al Mahmud ignited hope when despair seemed inevitable. Culture anchored the nation when politics fractured it. It built a moral common ground when violence threatened to shatter the unity of the people. To reclaim this cultural heritage today is not an exercise in nostalgia; it is an act of national reawakening. History’s generosity has not always been extended equally. Women in the liberation war remain insufficiently documented and insufficiently honoured. Their stories seldom fit the traditional narrative. Many took up arms, trained in combat and served as fighters in the Mukti Bahini. Many more worked as informants, couriers, medics and organisers. They endured torture, humiliation and violence designed deliberately to break the nation’s spirit. Yet their contributions are often reduced to symbolic references. The silence surrounding their sacrifices is a moral blind spot. Contemporary Bangladesh cannot advance meaningfully without acknowledging this historical debt. Virginia Woolf once wrote that for most of history, anonymous was a woman. In the context of Bangladesh, this anonymity is not merely literary; it is painfully real. To name these women, to document their stories, to honour their memory is essential to the completeness of the nation’s liberation war narrative. International involvement in 1971 is another chapter that demands renewed attention. Bangladesh did not fight its war of liberation in isolation. India’s military intervention was decisive. Global diplomats, progressive leaders and student movements across continents lent moral and political support. This international solidarity shaped the geopolitical landscape that allowed Bangladesh’s birth. Understanding these alliances is crucial not only for historical accuracy but also for contemporary diplomacy. The world has changed since 1971, and global powers today navigate a far more complex political terrain. Yet the fundamental lesson remains the same: strategic partnerships rooted in moral solidarity can shift the course of history. Bangladesh must remember this as it engages with global powers, balancing national interest with the principles of sovereignty that the liberation war sought to uphold. The ideals of 1971 remain powerful but often fragile in practice. Secularism, democracy, justice and economic dignity were the guiding lights of the liberation movement. To betray any of these is to become dishonest with blood. Whether in the suppression of dissent, violations of human rights, economic injustice or the erosion of democratic practice, any departure from these ideals is a wound inflicted upon the very foundation of the nation. The test of modern Bangladesh lies in whether it can uphold these values not in ceremonial speeches but in everyday governance. Recent years have shown that cultural resistance continues to remain a potent force. The uprising of July 2024 demonstrated that the spirit of collective expression is alive. Walls across the country became murals of dissent, colour and conscience. This echo of 1971 suggests that the nation still knows how to defend its soul when necessary. The economic transformation of Bangladesh is one of the most remarkable development stories of the postcolonial world. From a war-torn nation considered a global basket case, Bangladesh has emerged as an important economic player, especially in textiles, remittances, agriculture and small-scale entrepreneurship. Its resilience has been compared by some scholars to the postwar reconstruction of countries like Vietnam and South Korea. Yet the nation must remain vigilant. Economic growth without strengthening institutions can become a trap. Prosperity that concentrates into a few hands deepens inequality. Development projects that ignore environmental sustainability create future crises. Engagement with powerful nations must be pragmatic but principled. The nation must recognise that economic dependence can easily transform into political vulnerability. The legacy of 1971 requires that Bangladesh protect its autonomy in every negotiation, treaty and partnership. Victory Day is therefore more than a ceremonial celebration. It is a moral checkpoint. It asks the nation whether its present reflects the promises of its past. It demands that citizens examine whether the freedom won in 1971 is being used to build a just, compassionate and forward-looking society. How Bangladesh treats its weakest citizens, how it distributes public resources, how it guards fundamental rights, how it remembers its martyrs and how it prepares its youth will determine whether this freedom remains alive or becomes a ritualistic memory. The philosopher Hannah Arendt once wrote that freedom is the capacity to begin anew. Bangladesh has exercised this capacity repeatedly, through political upheavals, natural disasters, economic crises and generational transitions. But beginning anew does not mean forgetting what came before. Memory is not a burden; it is an ethical compass. Bangladesh’s journey from 1971 to the present is a living testament to the invincible courage of its people. But the journey is still incomplete. The sacrifices of the past must continue to illuminate the road ahead. Victory Day is not a date on the calendar. It is a responsibility, a memory, a promise and a reminder that the nation’s freedom is a living entity. It thrives only when protected and dies whenever neglected. As Bangladesh stands at the intersection of its past and its future, the question is not whether it will remember 1971. The question is whether it will honour 1971. And that answer must come not in speeches, not in parades, not in televised tributes, but in the daily choices that define a nation’s character. If those choices are guided by honesty, justice, compassion and accountability, then the martyrs will not have died in vain. Then, and only then, will the victory of Bangladesh be complete.

{"title": "Race against disappearing land", "body": "For decades, development has been mistakenly equated with concrete highways, flyovers and towers. But concrete doesn’t feed people; soil does, writes Makhan Lal Dutta BANGLADESH has one of the smallest farming footprints in the world, but it nevertheless manages to provide food for 170 million people. That is a feat of tenacity and inventiveness. But it is also a gamble. The soil that supports the country is decreasing, eroding and being paved over at a rate that threatens to turn resilience into disaster. What appears to be efficiency today may in fact be fragility disguised. The arithmetic conveys the story. Bangladesh has the smallest cropland per person in South Asia, with less than a tenth of a hectare each, a figure that has been cut in half since 1980. Farmers have coped by planting two or three rice crops on the same plot of land each year, as well as converting ponds into fish farms that now feed towns and generate foreign exchange. But efficiency has its limitations. When the population grows, cities expand, and floods hit harder, the system bends until it breaks. Farming in Bangladesh is a precarious livelihood. Most farmers have extremely small plots of land, less than half a hectare, that are barely profitable. Because they operate on such razor-thin margins, a single bad harvest can lead to debt. A bad year might even force them to sell their land. This is how land disappears in Bangladesh: not through large-scale seizures, but through quiet, desperate transactions, one impoverished family at a time. The risks are already here. In 2024, monsoon floods wiped out over a million tonnes of rice, destroying months of labour and forcing Bangladesh to import food. A single climate shock pushed the country from self-sufficiency to a shortfall. These shocks are no longer rare. When they hit land already weakened by over-fertilisation, waterlogging and salinity, recovery becomes even slower and more expensive. The brutal reality is that no amount of human ingenuity can feed a nation if its soil is disappearing. It’s tempting to celebrate Bangladesh as a master of adaptation, and in many ways, it is. Submergence-tolerant rice now grows where floods once ruined crops. Aquaculture has boomed around cities, providing protein and livelihoods. These are genuine successes that matter, but they cannot replace land. Innovation can help us use soil more efficiently, but it can’t create it out of thin air. The deeper, more silent crisis is underground. Decades of chemical-heavy farming have left the soil tired, compacted, and depleted of organic matter. Salinity is also creeping further inland, especially in coastal areas battered by cyclones and tidal surges. Once soil health collapses, yields plummet, fertiliser costs soar, and farmers face desperation. Restoring fertility is possible, but it takes years, money and patience, luxuries most farmers don’t have. The way forward isn’t a mystery. Other countries have shown how to slow the loss. We can implement zoning laws to protect prime farmland from development and use compact, vertical urban planning to keep cities from swallowing villages. We can also reward farmers who rotate crops, return organic matter to the soil and reduce harmful inputs. Disaster preparedness, from seed banks to early warning systems, can lessen losses from floods and storms. Bangladesh has already piloted all these approaches. The challenge isn’t a lack of innovation; it’s a lack of willpower. There are already success stories. In some districts, community-led land-use planning has balanced urban growth with agricultural preservation. Farmer cooperatives are pooling land to improve their bargaining power and prevent further fragmentation. Peri-urban vegetable farms and regulated aquaculture are meeting the needs of cities without destroying cropland. These are promising signs, but without being scaled up, they will remain isolated examples in a landscape dominated by uncontrolled sprawl. The core issue is a matter of mindset. For decades, development has been mistakenly equated with concrete highways, flyovers and towers. But concrete doesn’t feed people; soil does. A city that paves over its food base isn’t modernising; it’s devouring its own future. While selling land to developers might boost GDP, the hidden costs will appear later in the form of higher food prices, malnutrition and lost rural livelihoods. The question is not whether Bangladesh can feed itself in 2025 or 2030, but whether it will have the land to feed itself in 2050. The answer depends on what we choose to protect now. Bangladesh has proven its ability to adapt under pressure time and again. The same ingenuity that grew rice on floodplains and fish in ponds can also protect farmland from sprawl and restore depleted soils. But that ingenuity requires political backing, regulatory power and public recognition that land is not just a commodity.

{"title": "Liverpool a ‘mess’ says Van Dijk", "body": "Virgil van Dijk said Liverpool’s players are letting manager Arne Slot down after the Premier League champions’ collapse continued with a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. Liverpool have lost six of their last seven league games to slide into the bottom half of the table, putting Slot under pressure after the club’s record spend of nearly £450 million ($590 million) in the transfer market. ‘We are definitely letting him (Slot) down but we’ve let ourselves down as well,’ said Van Dijk. ‘You look at yourself first and then you help each other, you help each other get out of this mess because at the moment it is a mess - that’s just a fact. ‘As the champions we can’t be in the situation we are in right now. What are we going to do about it? We’re going to try to turn it around and that’s the mentality everyone should have.’ None of Liverpool’s big money summer signings have yet to make a positive impact. Alexander Isak, who cost a British transfer record £125 million, is still to score a league goal for the Reds and looked a shadow of the player he was at Newcastle during an ineffectual 68 minutes against Forest. But many of last season’s title winners have also suffered a slump in form with Van Dijk’s centre-back partner Ibrahima Konate also replaced early by Slot after another poor performance. ‘What I want is for everyone to take responsibility on the pitch. We have to do that in order to push each other, to make each other better,’ added Van Dijk. ‘We have been through it together and won the league and everyone was part of it and happy and when you go through a tough time you have to stick together and not point fingers. ‘You have to be a man and face the toughness and go again, again and again because if you want to give up then you are at the wrong place in my eyes because this club has gone through much adversity over those years and we’ve always come out of it.’ Liverpool’s form in the Champions League has been much better with three wins from four games.

{"title": "How bad must it get?", "body": "HOW many floods, droughts, and wildfires will it take before governments and industry take the action needed to slow — let alone reverse — the catastrophe that is climate change? How many lives, homes, and communities must be lost until the deluded devotees of the fossil fuel economy are forced to wake up and alter their behaviour? The fanatics, the petro-states, and the denialists — figures like president Trump, who has repeatedly dismissed climate change as a ‘hoax’ – ‘the greatest con-job in the world’ — remain wedded to a consumer-based ideology of greed and limitless growth. Tell that to those most affected. The people of Jamaica, for example, where Hurricane Melissa recently tore buildings to pieces as it swept across the island. The 13 million displaced in Bangladesh and eastern India due to flash floods and landslides triggered by a monsoon surge that dropped up to 800 mm of rain in just five days. Or people across Europe, where the hottest summer on record saw temperatures reach 48°C (118°F). Tell the 40,000 evacuated in central China after July’s landslides and river flooding that climate change is a ‘con-job.’ Tell the Japanese, who in January endured an extreme cold surge that buried parts of the country under three metres of snow — followed by sudden warming that triggered landslides, urban flooding, and collapsed buildings. The examples are endless, the suffering immense. No region of the world is safe from the accelerating impacts of climate change. We are already at 1.3°C of warming above pre-industrial levels, and unless substantive, sustained action is taken to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world is on track to reach 2.6°C by 2100. And, ‘a world at 2.6°C means global disaster,’ warns Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics. At that level, major climate tipping points become increasingly likely: the collapse of key Atlantic Ocean circulation, the loss of coral reefs, long-term deterioration of ice sheets, and the conversion of the Amazon rainforest into savannah. ‘That all means the end of agriculture in the UK and across Europe, drought and monsoon failure in Asia and Africa, lethal heat and humidity,’ Hare explains. ‘This is not a good place to be. You want to stay away from that.’ By denying the reality of climate change and making incendiary, false statements, Trump and other powerful figures increase the risk of uncontrolled heating, emboldening autocrats and business leaders to ignore the science, obstruct progress, and sacrifice the future for short-term political gain — a future that, if 2–2.6°C is reached, could be apocalyptic. AS COP30 — like so many COPs before it — failed to deliver binding commitments to curb emissions, the question, ‘if not now, when?’ is more pertinent than ever. Relentless lobbying from fossil fuel interests, the influence of petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, and a chronic lack of political will made a binding, meaningful statement impossible. According to the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition, more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the summit — a 12 per cet increase on the previous UN gathering in Baku, Azerbaijan. Meaning one in every 25 COP30 attendees was a fossil fuel lobbyist. It is outrageous that lobbyists are present at these summits at all. Their sole purpose is to pressurise country representatives to act in the interests of fossil fuels; they should be banned outright. But the scale of complicity — and the brazenness of state collusion — is staggering. Some countries of the Global North include fossil fuel representatives within their official delegations. France brought 22 fossil fuel delegates, including five from TotalEnergies; Japan’s delegation contained 33 lobbyists, representing companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Osaka Gas; Norway quietly included 17, including six senior executives from its national oil and gas giant, Equinor. This absurd situation reflects a consistent pattern of human hypocrisy and moral weakness, demonstrated most loudly by political and corporate leaders. Peace is routinely spoken of, yet nation-states manufacture and sell arms, embrace nationalism, and champion competition. We claim to value equality, yet deny minorities safety, and inflame intolerance. We speak of justice, yet build economies rooted in injustice and inequality. Democracy is lauded, yet the marginalised are excluded, and a socio-economic system rooted in division and greed is worshipped. We abhor hunger, yet refuse to share what is in abundance, while funding industrial agriculture that devastates soils and communities. We pledge to protect the planet, yet pursue limitless growth based on unconstrained consumerism, continue to subsidise fossil fuels, and destroy ecosystems. We abhor hunger, yet refuse to share what is in abundance, while funding industrial agriculture that devastates the land. We pledge to protect the planet, yet pursue limitless growth based on unconstrained consumerism; continue to subsidise fossil fuels, and destroy ecosystems. On and on — the examples are many, the duplicity relentless. COP30, like summits before it, served as a stage for this contradictory and destructive pattern. It is a form of collective insanity that is poisoning the planet, destabilising its systems, and threatening the future of both the Earth and humanity. Greed and consumerism THE men and women in power do not really want change. They seek a continuation of the status quo: to maintain control and amass even more wealth, no matter the impact on the planet or the poor and disenfranchised. They do not care in the slightest about the long-term consequences of their short-term decisions, driven as they are by the twin poisons of desire and greed. A negotiator from a developing country told the Guardian: ‘In the negotiating rooms you hear people opposing the science, saying: “Oh, there is other science besides the IPCC,’ that the IPCC is not ‘the best available science”… We keep defending it, but they don’t listen… Or they say: “Oh, 1.5°C is in the past; we are already through 1.5°C; don’t talk about 1.5°C.” But that’s not true either… Where is their humanity?’ COP30 eventually agreed to a framework for phasing out fossil fuels, but it is wholly inadequate — vague, non-binding, and far too slow. The eradication of fossil fuels is the minimum states, particularly in the Global North, should already be working towards. In addition, a pledge of $120bn a year for developing countries to ‘help them adapt to the impacts of extreme weather’ was announced — three times the current level — but it will not come into force until 2035, and rich nations have an abysmal record of honouring such promises. AND this brings us to the heart of the matter. As in almost every other sphere of contemporary life, the environmental debate is governed not by the urgent question, What must we do to save the planet? — but by money, and that most corrosive human trait, complacency. The environmental crisis is a devastating symptom of a reductive worldview built on materialism, pleasure, division, and greed. It is the most perilous expression of a web of interconnected crises, including armed conflict, rising crime, deteriorating mental health, homelessness, inequality, and hunger. To address this unprecedented crisis, we must confront its underlying causes: limitless consumerism, greed, and selfishness. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables is essential, but unless the socio-economic paradigm itself is redesigned — and the values that sustain this destructive system are fundamentally challenged — climate change and the wider environmental catastrophe will continue unabated. Within the existing consumer-based order, and under the self-centred, divisive values it promotes, meaningful action is impossible. The science is clear, the causes known; what is missing is political will — the moral courage to reshape society around principles of justice, sharing, and responsibility for one another and for the planet. The wellbeing of the environment — not short-term profit or political gain — needs to guide decision-making within governments and corporations. An economy of restraint and sufficiency, in place of excess, should be embraced to reduce consumption and, with it, energy demand. With consistent stewardship, the natural world — the climate, the air, the waterways, and the ecosystems — would then have a chance to recover. If such steps are not put in place — if the deniers and vandals continue to dominate policy and silence the common-sense majority — the future looks increasingly dark: extreme weather will become normal, agriculture devastated, vast areas uninhabitable. All because a small, powerful minority — a cabal of political and corporate interests in the Imperial North — refuse to curb their greed or loosen their grip on a failing, violent economic order.

{"title": "DRC farmers seek to feed Kinshasa, despite multiple obstacles", "body": "The Kimwenza Valley is a vital source of food for residents of Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, but its farmers need help to meet their ballooning needs. They are constricted on the one hand by construction that is transforming fields into concrete jungles, and on the other, by impoverished soils and competition from cheap food imports that undermine their revenue. The DRC has nearly 80 million hectares of arable land and four million hectares of irrigable land. But only one per cent is actually cultivated, according to a study published in 2022 by the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). And more than 26 million Congolese people are at risk of severe food insecurity by early 2026, the UN said. Coveted for its vast mineral resources, the central African country is seeing sectors of the economy other than mining being crowded out, the FAO said. There are two very different flanks to Kimwenza Valley on the southern outskirts of Kinshasa, a megacity of around 17 million inhabitants which is constantly expanding and engulfing the surrounding countryside. One flank is covered with tranquil forests and fields where typical local crops like spinach, sorrel and chives grow. Birds sing and the Lukaya River burbles along the valley floor. The opposite flank has disappeared under concrete because real estate speculation is driving many landowners to convert agricultural land into building plots. Forner nursery schoolteacher Sylvia Nkelane left her poor, densely populated neighbourhood of Kinshasa to work in Kimwenza. She initially knew nothing about farming, but her school closed and she found herself forced to fend for herself, just like millions of other Kinshasa residents living in precarious conditions. She had to pay a deposit for the right to farm her small plot of land, which measures about 10 metres (33 feet) by three, and pays rent to the landowner every month. ‘But it’s temporary,’ she sighed, standing barefoot in her freshly hoed soil. ‘This is private land. We’re only here for a short time, and if we have to leave, we’ll have nowhere to go.’ Peasant farmers’ efforts to provide food for the nation — and their own families — is further hampered by difficulties of getting produce to market and by competition from cheap imports. Local producers must contend with poor roads, dotted with checkpoints which illegally levy taxes to let them through. By contrast, firms that import food products do not encounter such obstacles and also ‘often manage to circumvent tariff barriers’ that they should face, Nkelane said. Poultry from Brazil, widely criticised for its poor quality, and fruit and vegetables from South Africa or Europe all flood Kinshasa supermarkets, often at exorbitant prices. Despite abundant rainfall, the Kinshasa region is not particularly conducive to agriculture, which further complicates the farmers’ efforts. Its sandy soils have a low capacity for retaining water and a poor level of organic matter, as does the rest of the Congo River basin, according to the FAO. Small farmers like Nkelane rarely have the means to buy tools or the chemical fertilisers and insecticides they deem necessary to improve their soil. ‘We have to make do with what little we have. It’s complicated,’ her neighbour, Ruphin Kizonzi, told AFP. Just under half of Congolese farming households have access to quality seeds and almost none to fertiliser, according to a study by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification published in 2024. To the northwest of Kinshasa, a pilot farm supported by the World Food Programme is working to transform sand into fertile land. Carrots and papaya plants have already pushed up through a rectangle of dark soil, thanks to a technique based on organic fertilisers made from a mixture of compost and chicken manure. It was developed by Oswald Symenouh, an agronomist who heads the company running the farm. ‘It allows water retention because the texture of the soil has changed,’ he explained. The development is not an immediate panacea. Small-scale farmers need training and support to introduce it, and it takes about ‘two years for the soil to be suitable for use in various vegetable crops’. It nonetheless remains a positive, welcome development.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/283558/drc-farmers-seek-to-feed-kinshasa-despite-multiple-obstacles", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 691},

It is a parasitic one-sided benefit, entangled in the tentacles of organised influence, manipulation, financial power, and media control. Israel contributes next to nothing of tangible benefit to America’s security, strategic value, or economy, yet Washington continues to design its foreign policy and moral compass around Israel. It is so absurd it borders on sorcery. A relationship driven by an Israel-first agenda that extends beyond the halls of Congress into the very architecture of the disinformation system. It reshapes how Americans think and how they view the world: through congress, through newsrooms, through algorithms, and through paid ‘influencers,’ one at a time. To that end, the American media and entertainment industries serve as essential tools for molding the nation’s political landscape and American culture. Oracle’s CEO, Safra Catz, captured this intent candidly in a 2015 email to former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, writing, ‘We believe that we have to embed the love and respect for Israel in the American culture.’ A decade later, that vision is maturing. Israel-first Oracle founder Larry Ellison is now poised to acquire major show business studios and news outlets. His son, David Ellison, has become the head of Paramount and CBS through the Skydance–Paramount merger. This is while Ellison senior in talks to purchase Warner Bros., its film studios, and CNN. As a major media owner and influential figure in political campaigns, Ellison has a well-documented history of coordinating with Israeli government officials. Evidence of this surfaced recently in hacked emails published by Drop Site News and Responsible Statecraft. In 2015, in an email exchange, Israel’s then–ambassador to the United Nations, Ron Prosor, asked Ellison if Senator Marco Rubio had ‘passed his scrutiny.’ Ellison assured him that Rubio ‘will be a great friend for Israel,’ later donating $5 million for Rubio’s presidential primary campaign. Rubio didn’t pass Ellison’s scrutiny as an America patriot; he passed it for Israel. Under the ownership of Israel-first billionaires, American media outlets have become revolving doors for ‘embedded’ Zionist shaping public perception. Case in point is Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, and the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss is described as ‘ardent supporter of Israel’ who has used her platform to whitewash the Israeli genocide and starvation campaign in Gaza. She is now bringing those talking points from a fringe outlet straight into one of the nation’s major news organizations. Ellison and other Israel-first donors like Miriam Adelson, who gave Trump’s campaign $100 million, have one single focus: who is best to represent Israel’s interests in Washington. Even Trump, who brands himself as an ‘America First’ president, admits as much telling the Israeli Knesset that his major donor, Adelson, loves Israel more than America. In addition to traditional media, social media has become the latest arena for influence by Israel-first power brokers. TikTok stands out as the first major platform not owned or controlled by Israel-first investors. For this reason, Tik Tok was possibly the only major social media outlet that escaped the Israeli managed algorithm. It is no coincidence that Israeli officials, along with Israel-first Jewish American politicians and media pundits, have amplified claims of ‘data security risks’ to justify efforts to either shut TikTok down or take control of its messaging. Leading the push to acquire TikTok is none other than Israel-first Ellison and Murdoch families. The same Israel-first billionaires whose influence extends across media, technology, and politics. The TikTok debate has little to do with data security and everything to do with Israeli narrative security. The concern was never Chinese access to American data, but rather the inability of the Israel-first actors to manipulate TikTok’s algorithm and content flow. Ironically, even Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu applauded the planned takeover of TikTok, calling it ‘the most important purchase going on right now.’ ‘Weapons change over time,’ he told a group of Israeli ‘digital warriors.’ ‘The most important ones are on social media.’ The consequences reach far beyond the newsroom. A Responsible Statecraft investigation revealed that Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been quietly paying American social media influencers up to $7,000 per post to push pro-Israel content without any disclosure. In other words, US information space is being systematically infiltrated by undisclosed foreign propaganda. What we are witnessing is not just the manufacturing of consent, but a corporate and money colonization of truth. With Ellison’s empire controlling these platforms, Weiss’ like controlling the newsroom, and Israel’s ministries funding the feeds, the American mind is a victim of engineered illusion. This is not mere media bias. It is institutionalised propaganda disguised as ‘mainstream journalism.’ Voltaire once wrote, ‘Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.’ For decades, Israel and its enablers have convinced Americans of the absurd: that religion grants Europeans ancestral rights to the Middle East, a nuclear-armed occupier is a victim, and genocide is ‘self-defense.’ America’s real test of democracy is not on the battlefields, but in confronting AIPAC and Israel-first influence over our executive and legislative branches, the curated news, and most dangerously, the creeping effort to stifle academic freedom in our universities, sealing the colonization of the American mind. The intersection of political influence and media ownership raises concerns not only about the extent of its reach, but in how seamlessly it blends into the cultural and political mainstream, making foreign interests appear as domestic consensus. The merging of political power and Israel-first money has reduced US media to an instrument of ideological conformity. Now with Israel-first Fox News, combined with Ellison’s expanding media empire monopolizing the narrative, America will finally have its version of the Israel-Pravda.

The accused are seven officials of Agrani Bank and four, including three owners of Nurjahan Group, a Chattogram-based industrial conglomerate, are loan receivers. ACC deputy director Subel Ahmed confirmed the lodging of the case with its local office. Deputy assistant director of ACC Chattogram integrated office-1 accused them to disburse loan against foreign LC violating Bangladesh Bank regulations and thus misappropriated the amount in connivance, he said. The bank officials are—ex-principal officer of the bank’s Asadganj Branch Mostak Ahmed, ex-DGM of Ctg central region Md Abul Hossain Talukder, ex-GM of the Bank’s head office Md Obayed Ullah Al Masud, ex-GM of Sylhet circle Md Shams Ul Islam and ex-DGM Tajrina Ferdousi, ex-GM of head office Md Mofazzal Hossain and Bank’s ex-MD and CEO Syed Abdul Hamid. Businessmen who were implicated in the case are loan receiver Md Mizanur Rahman, proprietor of M/S Mizan Trading at Katunganj, and guarantors in favor of loan receiver and directors of the Jasmir Vegetable Oil Ltd, a sister concern of the Nurjahan Group, Zahir Ahmed, Tipu Sultan and Farhad Monowar. According to the case statement, ACC in its investigation revealed that Agrani Bank’s Asadganj Branch had opened a Letter of Credit valuing Tk 126.11 crore and 52 thousands in favour of M/S Mizan Traders to import chickpeas and wheat on the basis of recommendations of five officials of the Bank’s head office although the actual loan receiver was not a trusted client and not fulfilled required pre-conditions of getting the loan against foreign LC. The businessmen were accused in the case as they were also signatory of the loan sanction letter as guarantor. The bank finally disbursed Tk 51 crore out of entire LC value Tk 126.11 crore and 52 thousand and as the loan amount has not been paid within due time, the actual loan amount has now stood at around Tk 190 crore with interest.

Twenty-three militants were killed in raids in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, the military said. In a subsequent statement, the military said a further seven militants were killed in three separate operations in Mohmand, Lakki Marwat and Tank districts in the same province on November 18-19. ‘Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,’ the military said. Islamabad has routinely accused Kabul of harbouring militant groups, particularly the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, that stage deadly attacks in Pakistan. Pakistan has also stepped up its rhetoric against India in recent months, which it claims backs militant groups. Both neighbours deny any involvement. The raids come after a suicide bombing outside a court in Islamabad killed 12 people and wounded dozens last week, which Pakistan said was planned from Afghanistan. A faction of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have sharply deteriorated, with cross-border clashes last month prompting the worst fighting in years.

{"title": "Dembele returns for PSG after six weeks out", "body": "Ballon d’Or winner Ousmane Dembele was on Monday included in Paris Saint-Germain’s squad to face Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League after a six-week injury layoff. Dembele’s return for Tuesday’s league stage game will come as a welcome boost for coach Luis Enrique, whose side has been struggling with injuries this season. Dembele, 28, has been out since injuring a hamstring while on international duty with France in early September. He had been recuperating at a specialist clinic in Qatar and returned to training last week. He missed out on PSG’s entertaining 3-3 draw against Strasbourg on Friday but could play some role in Germany as the European champions seek to make it three wins out of three in the Champions League so far this season. Leverkusen centre-back Loic Bade, Dembele’s teammate in the France squad, told reporters Monday there was ‘no secret recipe’ to stopping the PSG forward, calling him ‘a complete player with several qualities’. ‘He won the Ballon d’Or -- of course he’s got a lot of quality. He’s good with both feet. I don’t think he’s got a weak side,’ Bade said. ‘You need to think as a team, defend as a team and be as compact with your teammates as possible.’ PSG welcomed back forwards Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who was a substitute, against Strasbourg. They are, however, still missing midfield duo Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves, although captain Marquinhos, another recent injury absentee, has travelled to Germany with the squad. Leverkusen coach Kasper Hjulmand, who took over when former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag was sacked in September after just two league games, said PSG’s high-energy press was ‘a weapon’ but also ‘a risk.’ ‘They’re a super team who have developed further since last year,’ the Dane said. ‘(But) we have a lot of quality in our team and we want to show it. We’ve got trust in our game.’ Leverkusen, Bundesliga champions in 2024, drew with FC Copenhagen and PSV Eindhoven in their first two Champions League games of the season.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/279713/dembele-returns-for-psg-after-six-weeks-out", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 340},

The trustee of the funds, Bangladesh General Insurance Company (BGIC), announced the suspension on Thursday following directives from the capital market regulator. The six closed-end mutual funds include DBH First Mutual Fund, Green Delta Mutual Fund, AIBL 1st Islamic Mutual Fund, MBL 1st Mutual Fund, LR Global Bangladesh Mutual Fund One, and NCCBL Mutual Fund-1. According to a notice by the Dhaka Stock Exchange, BGIC instructed all banks and brokerage houses maintaining accounts for these funds to immediately halt all debit transactions — including online banking — and suspend all trading activities conducted by LR Global. The move, the trustee said, was aimed at protecting the interests of unit holders whose investments had been compromised. BSEC officials said that the BGIC would give the management responsibility of the six mutual funds to another asset management company after clearing the accounts issues with the LR Global. The BSEC in an investigation found that LR Global had misused nearly Tk 69 crore from the six funds by investing in Padma Printers, a defunct and loss-making company listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The investments were made in two phases. In the first phase, about Tk 24 crore was invested to acquire a 51 per cent shares in the closed and loss-making company at an inflated price. After acquiring these shares, the company’s name was changed to Quest BDC Limited. After the name change, a further Tk 45 crore was invested from the six funds in a second phase, through a private placement of new shares. The shares were issued to increase paid-up capital of Quest BDC’s. The regulator said the investment, made at highly inflated prices, essentially wasted investors’ money and violated the core principles of fund management and fiduciary responsibility. On October 21, the BSEC banned LR Global CEO Reaz Islam for life for his role in the misuse of funds. The regulator also ordered the company to return around Tk 90 crore, including interest, to the six mutual funds within 30 days. If the repayment is not made within the deadline, Reaz Islam will face a fine of Tk 98 crore, while LR Global directors George M Stock III and Rezaur Rahman Sohag will each be fined Tk 1 crore.

{"title": "Taijul, openers tighten Tigers’ grip", "body": "Taijul Islam’s four-for and half-centuries from openers Shadman Islam and Mahmudul Hasan further strengthened Bangladesh’s position in the second Test against Ireland after the completion of the third day at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Friday. The hosts were 156-1 and took 367-run lead in the second innings at the stumps, as Shadman Islam was batting on 69 with Mominul Haque 19 after Ireland were all out for 265 in the first innings. Shadman Islam and Mahmudul Hasan started brightly after the hosts decided against enforcing the follow-on despite having a lead of 211 runs. Mahmudul, who survived in the first over, was shaky at the beginning but started to find his rhythm as Bangladesh added 41 runs in seven overs before the tea. The openers continued to dominate the final session, as both were approaching at the same rate. Mahmudul reached his fifty in 75 balls, while Shadman needed 76 balls. However, Mahmudul’s stay was ended by Hoey when he trapped lbw the Bangladesh opener, who made 60 off 91 balls with six fours. After a lengthy discussion with his partner, Mahmudul opted not to review. Mominul and Shadman then saw out the remainder of the session to put Bangladesh further ahead. Earlier, after resuming the day at 98-5, still 178 runs away from avoiding the follow-on, Lorcan Tucker led Ireland as he added two 70-plus partnerships with Stephen Doheny and Jordan Neill, respectively. Tucker’s partnership with Doheny lasted for 25 overs, where they added 81 runs. Taijul Islam then got Bangladesh on track soon after the three-minute delay caused by the earthquake that hit the country, when he struck twice in the space of three deliveries. Stephen Doheny—who made 46 and added 81 runs with Tucker—and Andy McBrine were both bowled by two extraordinary deliveries. However, Tucker, who reached his fifty in 104 balls, continued to hold the fort as he added a further 74-run partnership for the eighth wicket with Neill. This was Ireland’s highest eighth-wicket partnership. Ebadot Hossain broke that stand as Neill was caught at cover while being only one run shy of his maiden Test fifty. Khaled then had Gavin Hoey before Taijul finished things off with the wicket of Humphreys to equal Shakib Al Hasan in the record of highest wickets (246) for Bangladesh. The left-arm spinner finished with a figure of four for 76 runs, equalled Shakib al Hasan’s tally of 246 Test wickets. The pace duo of Ebadot and Khaled Ahmed each took two wickets, while Hasan Murad and Mehidy Hasan Miraz took one apiece.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/cricket/282821/taijul-openers-tighten-tigers-grip", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 426},

Abdallah Kamil, governor of the Tulkarem governorate where Nur Shams is located, said he was informed of the planned demolition by the Israeli defence ministry body COGAT. Faisal Salama, head of the popular committee for Tulkarem camp, which is near Nur Shams, said the demolition order would affect 25 buildings holding up to 100 family homes. ‘We were informed by the military and civil coordination that the occupation will carry out the demolition of 25 buildings on December 18, Thursday,’ he said. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it was ‘looking into it’. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. In early 2025, Israel’s military launched a wide-ranging and still on-going operation it says is aimed at rooting out Palestinian armed groups from refugee camps in the northern West Bank — including the Nur Shams, Tulkarem and Jenin camps. The operation displaced all the residents and more than 30,000 have yet to return home. During the operation, Israel has destroyed hundreds of houses in the dense network of alleys that make up the camps to create easy access for its troops stationed inside. Nur Shams, along with other refugee camps in the West Bank, was established after the creation of Israel in 1948, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced from their homes in what is now Israel. With time, the camps they established inside the West Bank became dense neighbourhoods not under their adjacent cities’ authority.

Washington’s new National Security Strategy, published early Friday, took aim at allies in Europe, calling it over-regulated, lacking in ‘self-confidence’ and facing ‘civilizational erasure’ due to immigration. The document stated that the United States would also prevent other powers from dominating but added: ‘This does not mean wasting blood and treasure to curtail the influence of all the world’s great and middle powers.’ Commenting on the new US strategy, the Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the current US administration was ‘fundamentally different from the previous ones’. ‘The adjustments we’re seeing, I would say, are largely consistent with our vision,’ Peskov said in an interview with state TV station Rossiya aired Sunday. ‘President Trump is currently strong in terms of domestic political positions. And this gives him the opportunity to adjust the concept to suit his vision,’ Peskov added. The publication of the updated security strategy came as officials from Kyiv held talks in Florida with Trump’s envoys on the US-drafted plan to end the near four-year war in Ukraine. Three days of talks produced no apparent breakthrough. President Volodymyr Zelensky committed to further negotiations toward ‘real peace’, as Russia in the early hours of Saturday launched another series of drone and missile strikes at Ukraine.

{"title": "Rutte, Russia and delusions about Trump", "body": "IT WAS a speech unhinged in millenarian zeal. It was unapologetically hysterical in urging war while claiming to protect peace. It was also delivered with a note of profound self-denial: the US administration’s 2025 National Security Strategy had belittled Europe’s efforts in terms of ensuring its own security, not least of all its claims to civilisational supremacy. President Donald Trump has tirelessly insisted that the continent bloat the military industrial complex and confront its demographic problems. From the opening, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte reflects on a piece of the Berlin Wall kept in NATO headquarters. ‘It was a barrier to keep people in, and ideas out. Now it is a monument to the force of freedom, a reminder of the power of unity, and a lesson that we must stay strong, confident and steadfast.’ He might have gone further to explain how the collapse of the Berlin Wall was also a chance to stabilise Europe and temper the tensions with the then ailing Soviet Union. Assurances by NATO members and respective US administrations that eastward expansion toward Russia would be eschewed, were never honoured. NATO became Washington’s spear of hubris, a post-Cold War entity of triumphalism. It would only grow, making Moscow ever more anxious. The message is one of foaming agitation. Russia and ‘the dark forces of oppression’ again coming to the fore. The mission of the alliance reinvigorated. Claiming that NATO was ‘to stop a war before it starts,’ he proceeded to fan the flames. ‘We are Russia’s next target, and we are already in harm’s way.’ Russia, a country bleeding in war, burdened by sanctions, with an economy hovering in size between Canada and Italy, would seemingly wish to plunge a continent into an infernal maelstrom. Rutte is wilfully blind to this point, purposely elevating the threat posed by Russia despite its loss of over 1.1 million casualties since the war’s outbreak in February 2022, with a daily average loss of 1,200 troops a day in 2025. ‘Think about that, more than a million casualties so far, and 1,200 a day, killed or wounded, this year alone.’ Think about that, and it makes remarks that Europe had to prepare ‘for the scale of war our grandparents or great-parents endured’ grotesque and misplaced. In the Rutter strategy, it becomes axiomatic to link Ukraine’s decidedly gloomy fate to that of NATO, a false link one has come to expect in that dubious, often mendacious discipline called international relations. Russia’s ambitions on Ukrainian territory become synonymous with the Kremlin’s feverish designs on Western and Central European capitals. ‘Allied defence spending and production must rise rapidly, our armed forces must have what they need to keep us safe, and Ukraine must have what it needs to defend itself — now.’ He proudly mentions NATO allies agreeing to push defence expenditure to levels of 5 per cent of GDP by 2035, an insular, wasteful measure. ‘But this is not the time for self-congratulation, I fear that too many are quietly complacent, and too many don’t feel the urgency, too many believe that time is on our side.’ Whether by design or ignorance, Rutte’s smug civilisational rhetoric ignores the threatening shadow of Trump’s National Security Strategy, which takes aim at alleged anti-democratic practices of European states. (The phrasing here, as with much of the document, is conceptually confused and a travesty of language.) ‘The Trump Administration finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition.’ Peace was demanded by the European majority, ‘yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments’ subversion of democratic processes.’ The NSS comes close to dismissing Europe as an ailing patient on the verge of expiring, abominating the European Union and those ‘transnational bodies that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies that are transforming the continent and creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.’ This can hardly sit well with Rutte and NATO’s European component, seeing as the Trump administration envisages an unrecognisable continent in the next two decades, doubting that ‘certain European countries will have economies strong enough to remain reliable allies.’ Rarely has such an explicit statement on abandonment been made. The howling subtext here is Ukraine’s increasing irrelevance to US foreign policy, evident in the parallel lines of European-Ukrainian negotiations on the war, and US-Russian discussions that sup from a different cup. Washington would support European allies in preserving ‘freedom and security’ and restore ‘Europe’s civilisational self-confidence and western identity’ but would have its main eyes trained on asserting and enforcing ‘a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine.’ Latin America promises to suffer most, given this brash assertion of hemispheric domination. Rutte, bless him, is putting on a brave face. In an interview with the BBC following his Berlin address, he remained industriously oblivious. Trump was ‘good news for collective defence, for NATO and for Ukraine.’ Under the US president’s stewardship, NATO was ‘stronger than it ever was.’ Time for a dose of that stiff medication called ‘reality.’ DissidentVoice.org, December 18.

{"title": "India ready to rev up chipmaking", "body": "When prime minister Narendra Modi declared India’s ‘late entry’ into the global semiconductor race, he pinned hopes on pioneers such as Vellayan Subbiah to create a chip innovation hub. The chairman of CG Power, who oversees a newly commissioned semiconductor facility in western India, is seen as one of the early domestic champions of this strategic sector in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. ‘There has been more alignment between the government, policymakers, and business than I’ve ever seen in my working history,’ Subbiah, 56, told AFP. ‘There’s an understanding of where India needs to go, and the importance of having our own manufacturing.’ As US President Donald Trump shakes global trade with tariffs and hard-nosed transactionalism, Modi has doubled down on self-reliance in critical technologies. New Delhi, which flagged its push in 2021, has this year approved 10 semiconductor projects worth about $18 billion in total, including two 3-nanometre design plants, among the most advanced. Commercial production is slated to begin by the end of the year, with the market forecast to jump from $38 billion in 2023 to nearly $100 billion by 2030. Subbiah, whose CG Power is one of India’s leading conglomerates, predicts ‘over $100 billion, if not more’, will flow into the industry across the value chain in the next five to seven years. He said ‘symbiotic’ public-private partnerships were ‘very exciting’. Chips are viewed as key to growth and a source of geopolitical clout. India says it wants to build a ‘complete ecosystem’, and break the global supply chain dominance by a few regions. The government has courted homegrown giants such as Tata, alongside foreign players like Micron, to push design, manufacturing and packaging in joint ventures. CG Semi, a joint venture with CG Power, plans to invest nearly $900 million in two assembly and test plants, as well as to push its design company. ‘We are looking to design chips, so that we can own the (intellectual property) too—which is very important for India,’ said Subbiah, a civil engineer by training with an MBA from the University of Michigan. Still, critics say India is decades late starting, and remains far behind chip leaders in Taiwan, the Netherlands, Japan and China. ‘First we have to recognise there is a gap,’ Subbiah said, noting Taiwan’s TSMC has a 35-year head start. But he insists India’s scale and talent pool—the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people—gives it ‘a significant ability to accelerate’ production. Modi this month said that ‘20 percent of the global talent in semiconductor design comes from India’. But wooing talent who sought opportunities abroad back to India remains a challenge, even after Trump’s restrictions on the H-1B skilled worker visa programme, heavily used by Indians. India, the world’s fifth-largest economy, still struggles with bureaucratic inertia and a lack of cutting-edge opportunities. Subbiah acknowledged that his own venture employs about 75 expatriates. ‘That’s not the way we want to grow. We want to grow with Indians,’ he said, calling for policies to lure back overseas talent. ‘How do we bring these people back?’ But the path is tougher than in 2021, when New Delhi first pushed for chip self-sufficiency. While India has secured semiconductor and AI investment pledges from partners such as Japan—which pledged $68 billion in August—Trump is expected to be less willing than past US leaders to back ventures that build Indian capacity. ‘The geopolitical situation overall has become more complicated,’ Subbiah said. Yet he remains upbeat for the long run. ‘There are only going to be two really low-cost ecosystems in the world: one is China, and the other is going to be India,’ he said. ‘You’re going to see the centre of gravity move towards these ecosystems, if you start thinking about a 25-30 year vision’.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/277754/india-ready-to-rev-up-chipmaking", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 626},

But the vast immigration crackdown launched under Republican president Donald Trump has swept up veterans of the US military, their relatives, pregnant women, children and even some American citizens, Magaziner said. ‘There are many problems with your leadership but the biggest problem is this: You don’t seem to know how to tell the difference between the good guys and the bad guys,’ he told the House Homeland Security Committee hearing, which was interrupted by demonstrators on several occasions. The panel’s ranking Democrat Bennie Thompson said Noem has ‘diverted resources from critical Homeland Security agencies and programs to carry out an extreme immigration agenda.’ ‘Black and brown Americans in particular, have been racially profiled, detained and locked up,’ Thompson said. ‘So rather than sitting here and wasting your time and ours with more corruption, lies and lawlessness, I call on you to resign,’ he said, echoing a call Democrats have made for months as ICE has raided major cities. In June, after senator Alex Padilla was tackled and cuffed at a press conference Noem held in Los Angeles, senator Elizabeth Warren and others demanded she step down. In Thursday’s hearing, Representative Delia C. Ramirez told Noem ‘your options are limited. Either you’re going to resign, Trump’s going to fire you, or you will be impeached.’ Ramirez, who represents the midwestern city of Chicago which has seen numerous ICE raids, also made a formal request for the House Judiciary Committee to open an investigation into Noem’s ‘unlawful and potentially impeachable actions.’ While Democrats lambasted Noem and the Trump administration, Republicans praised her department for securing the US-Mexico border and rounding up undocumented migrants for deportation. Noem defended the tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and accused the administration of Democrat Joe Biden of allowing ‘millions of people to come into our country illegally.’ She denied US citizens have been detained although she said there have been occasions when they were held until their identity could be confirmed. ‘We have never once detained or deported an American citizen,’ Noem said. ‘(When) we are doing our targeted enforcement operations against criminal illegal aliens, individuals that are in that area may be detained until we verify who they are, and then they are released.’ Trump ran for the White House promising to deport millions of undocumented migrants and Noem, as head of the Department of Homeland Security, oversees the operation.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/285013/democrats-grill-homeland-security-chief-over-immigration-crackdown", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 440},

Geopolitical tensions between China and the United States have intensified technological competition between the countries, each seeking to achieve supremacy in the vital fields of artificial intelligence and advanced computer chips. Shenzhen-based Huawei and California-based Nvidia are among the tech giants that have repeatedly been caught up in the rivalry, each facing various restrictions on their overseas operations. Huawei’s Deputy Chairman Eric Xu said Thursday that the firm intends to launch the Atlas 950 and Atlas 960 ‘SuperPoDs’, part of efforts to meet ‘long-term computing demand’, according to a press release. The products will be used to integrate thousands of Huawei chips, significantly enhancing the computing power that underpins various AI applications. They are expected to be launched in the fourth quarters of 2026 and 2027, respectively, according to a copy of Xu’s speech seen by AFP. An earlier report by state-controlled Chinese business news outlet Jiemian incorrectly stated that the Atlas 950 would launch this year. ‘These two SuperPoDs will deliver an industry-leading performance across multiple key metrics, including the number of NPUs (neural processing units), total computing power, memory capacity, and interconnect bandwidth,’ said Xu, quoted in the press release. The announcement comes a day after a report by the Financial Times said China’s internet regulator had instructed domestic tech giants, including Alibaba and ByteDance to terminate orders for certain Nvidia products. According to the FT, citing unnamed sources, the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered companies to end all testing and purchase plans for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D chips, state-of-the-art processors made especially for the country. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said Wednesday that he was ‘disappointed’ by the report. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian did not confirm new restrictions when asked about the report at a regular press conference on Thursday. ‘We always oppose discriminatory practices targeting specific countries when it comes to economic, trade and technology issues,’ he said. ‘China is willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with all parties to protect the stability of the global supply chain.’ Observers believe that Beijing’s moves to wean Chinese tech companies off Nvidia’s offerings are part of its effort to accelerate domestic production from companies like Huawei. The FT report also said that Beijing regulators have recently summoned Huawei and Cambricon — another domestic chipmaker — for discussions on how their products stack up against Nvidia’s chips for the Chinese market.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/telecom/276453/huawei-unveils-new-computing-tech-as-china-seeks-ai-strength", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 430},
{"title": "Nepal PM holds first talks since protests with parties, ‘Gen Z’", "body": "Nepal’s interim leader has held the first talks between political parties and youth representatives since last month’s deadly anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, officials said on Thursday. ‘We have succeeded in creating an environment of cooperation and trust by ending the state of lack of dialogue,’ prime minister Sushila Karki, the former chief justice appointed as interim leader, said in a statement on social media. The unrest on September 8-9 was triggered by a brief ban on social media, although it was fuelled by long-standing frustration over economic hardship and corruption. At least 73 people were killed during the two days of unrest, which left parliament, courts and government buildings in flames. Karki, 73, who will lead the Himalayan nation until elections, held a four-hour meeting with youth representatives on Wednesday, according to her media coordinator Ram Rawal. The challenges ahead to ensure the March 2026 elections pass off smoothly are huge — including deep public distrust in Nepal’s established parties. The meeting, headed by Karki, was attended by all major political parties and several ‘Gen Z’ representatives, Rawal said. Also included were representatives of the party of ousted former prime minister KP Sharma Oli, the Communist Party of Nepal — Unified Marxist Leninist. ‘After the protest, there was a trust gap between them,’ Rawal said. ‘This meeting has helped create an environment of trust for the upcoming elections.’ Karki said in a post on X that ‘the new generation, political parties and the government all have the same goal — to hold fair, secure and timely elections’. She has pledged to restore order and address calls for clean governance in the country of 30 million. Minister for Communication Jagadish Kharel told reporters after the meeting that it was ‘important and fruitful’. The unrest in September hit Nepal’s already fragile economy. The World Bank estimates a ‘staggering’ 82 per cent of the workforce is in informal employment, while GDP per capita stood at just $1,447 in 2024.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/280689/nepal-pm-holds-first-talks-since-protests-with-parties-gen-z", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 329},

Our decisions are made here,’ Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly said the United States ‘needs’ the resource-rich autonomous territory for security reasons and has refused to rule out using force to secure it. Trump on Sunday appointed Louisiana governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, prompting anger from Denmark, which summoned the US ambassador. ‘We need Greenland for national security. Not for minerals,’ Trump told a news conference in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday. ‘We have to have it,’ the president said, adding that Landry ‘wanted to lead the charge’. On his appointment, Landry immediately vowed to make the Danish territory ‘a part of the US’. In his post, Nielsen said he was ‘sad’ after hearing Trump’s renewed desire to take over Greenland. ‘Such words reduce our country to a question of security and power. That is not how we see ourselves, and that is not how we in Greenland can or should be described,’ Nielsen said. He also thanked the people of Greenland for facing the situation with ‘calm and dignity,’ and said he was also thankful for the support of other government leaders. ‘This support confirms that we are not alone here at home,’ he said. Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen on Monday said he was ‘deeply angered’ by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark’s sovereignty. The European Union also offered its ‘full solidarity’ to Denmark. Greenland ‘belongs to its people’, French president Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday. ‘I add my voice to that of the Europeans to express our full solidarity,’ he wrote on X. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly insisted that the vast island is not for sale and that it will decide its own future. Most of Greenland’s 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the United States, according to an opinion poll in January. In August, Denmark summoned the US charge d’affaires after at least three US officials close to Trump were seen in Greenland’s capital Nuuk trying to find out how people felt about deepening US ties.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/north-america/285997/greenland-pm-says-our-decisions-are-made-here", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 400},

The company blamed the disruption on ‘unforeseen operational challenges’ including technical glitches, adverse weather conditions and new rules for workers. India’s aviation watchdog ordered an investigation and demanded that IndiGo respond with plans to ease the interruptions, which have persisted since Monday. Passengers vented their anger online, with one airport user on X describing ‘complete mayhem’ with delays of up to eight hours and ‘no staff’ on hand to help. Some 1,232 IndiGo flights had been cancelled as of Wednesday, according to the company. The number of delays was not clear. IndiGo said it was offering customers alternative travel arrangements and refunds while restoring its services. The company acknowledged its ‘significantly disrupted’ operations were partly due to new crew rostering rules having a ‘negative compounding impact’. The rules came into effect last month and aim to give pilots and crew more rest periods to enhance passenger safety. The disruption is another setback to the no-frills carrier, which has built its reputation on punctuality.

According to a government order issued by the Internal Resources Division (IRD) on Tuesday, the reform initiative involves both restructuring and manpower expansion. A total of 3,597 new positions have been created-373 cadre posts and 3,224 non-cadre posts-across existing and newly established commissionrates, customs houses, and specialized units, said a NBR press release on Wednesday. The NBR said the move seeks to enhance revenue mobilization, promote economic self-reliance, improve service quality, and create a more business-friendly environment through a more dynamic and efficient indirect tax system. The reform and expansion plan, proposed by the NBR, received necessary administrative approvals from the Ministry of Public Administration, Finance Division, and the Cabinet Division before the final order was issued by the IRD. Under the new structure, a total of five new VAT commissionrates, four new customs houses, and three specialized offices will be established in three phases. In addition to setting up these 12 new units, the government order also provides for the expansion of existing commissionrates, customs houses, and specialised wings. It includes arrangements for customs operations at Dhaka Airport’s third terminal as well as the decentralization and expansion of customs and VAT intelligence activities.

{"title": "Dhaka-Mymensingh bus strike causes suffering", "body": "Passengers who use the Dhaka-Mymensingh route had to suffer immensely as bus services on the route remained suspended for the second day on Sunday. The commuters to and from Dhaka in the divisional city said that many of them had to scrap their plan and some of them had to begin their journey using alternative transports by paying higher fares and spending more time than they needed for travelling by bus. The police said that the standoff began on Friday, when Abu Raihan, a July protester from Haluaghat, allegedly faced verbal abuse from a bus staff member, Arun Jhontu, after accidentally bumping into him while boarding. Arun allegedly forced Raihan off the bus despite identifying himself as a ‘July fighter’, Raihan claimed. The incident sparked protests by the National Citizen Party. Local transport unions also held demonstrations demanding the workers’ safety. At least 300 buses belonging to United Paribahan and Soukhin Paribahan have been grounded since Saturday night, local operators said. Services to Mymensingh, Netrokona, Sherpur and Jamalpur remained halted following orders from transport leaders. ‘Since yesterday, I have been trying to travel to Dhaka, but it has been impossible. Such sudden strikes are unacceptable. We want the bus terminals to remain free from politics’, said Abu Taher, a passenger waiting at Maskanda terminal. Authorities had managed a temporary breakthrough on Saturday afternoon when protesters withdrew their sit-in at Maskanda Bus Stand after assurances that 16 buses of United Paribahan, owned by local Awami League leader Aminul Haque Shamim, would remain suspended indefinitely. Transport workers also lifted a blockade at the terminals from the Dhaka bypass area, amid the assurance of forming a monitoring team. But, union leaders reinstated the suspension later in the evening, demanding the unconditional release of the detained worker Arun and guarantees for workers’ safety. ‘Arun has been jailed over one incident, but punishing 16 buses linked to the livelihoods of so many workers is unfair’, said Sohel Rana, an assistant to a United Paribahan driver. Abu Raihan, the activist who was allegedly harassed, said that his group had withdrawn its protest after assurances from officials and transport leaders. ‘If buses remain shut and passengers continue to suffer, we will have no choice but to resume our movement’, he told reporters, calling for Maskanda terminal to be kept free from political influence. On Sunday morning, several transport workers at the terminal staged a hunger strike, demanding job security and a non-partisan transport system. Mymensingh District Motor Owners’ Association president and BNP leader Almagir Mahmud Alam said that some groups were exploiting the dispute for political advantage. ‘Using a few NCP activists as a front, a section is inflating the issue to gain undue benefits’, he alleged.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/278926/dhaka-mymensingh-bus-strike-causes-suffering", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 450},
{"title": "China unveils specific emissions targets", "body": "China on Wednesday issued its first ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases, a landmark pledge from the world’s top polluter as the United States doubles down on fossil fuels and Europe falters. The announcement was delivered via video by president Xi Jinping to a UN climate summit where some 120 nations will outline plans to curb global warming, which is intensifying disasters worldwide from floods in Pakistan to raging wildfires in Spain. Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by 7–10 per cent by 2035 relative to the year of the country’s peak emissions, believed to be 2025. Observers said that while the absolute figure may seem modest, China has a record of under-promising while over-delivering, driven by its green technology boom. It comes as the United States under president Donald Trump, who called climate change a ‘con job’ at the UN a day earlier, boosts fossil fuels both at home and abroad. ‘Green and low carbon transition is the trend of our time,’ said Xi in an official translation. ‘While some country is acting against it, the international community should stay focused in the right direction.’ China, responsible for nearly 30 per cent of global emissions, had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numeric targets for total emissions reductions. The new goal is backed by commitments to expand wind and solar six times over 2020 levels, drastically expand forests, and ramp up electric cars production. Most wealthy nations, historically the biggest contributors to warming, peaked decades ago but still lack credible plans to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. ‘Beijing’s commitment is a cautious step that favors steadiness and delivery over ambition’ Li Shuo, an expert at the Asia Society think tank who is well-connected in Beijing, said. ‘The good news is that in a world increasingly driven by self-interest, China may be better positioned than most to advance climate action,’ he added. The stated trajectory is similar to the path followed by the US and EU in the decade after their peak emissions but would fall well short of what is needed to limit warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels — the target set by the 2015 Paris Agreement to avoid the worst climate catastrophes. But by presenting a target well ahead of COP30, the year’s main climate gathering in Belem, Brazil, China signals its on-going commitment to the international process after the United States departed the Paris agreement for a second time. Under the 2015 accord — which nearly every country is part of — nations freely set their own targets but must strengthen them every five years. Most are behind schedule, notably the European Union, where several states fear moving too fast could hurt industry. France, for example, faces shaky finances and political turmoil, and wants more clarity on investment frameworks before committing to deeper decarbonisation. But French president Emmanuel Macron used his turn at the podium to rebut Trump’s broadside on climate change, telling fellow leaders the science is ‘clear enough.’ The UN meanwhile is trying to strike a balance between warning of catastrophe and maintaining hope. On one hand, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said last week that chances of limiting warming to 1.5C are on the verge of ‘collapsing,’ a view echoed by climatologists, with current temperatures already about 1.4C above pre-industrial levels. But on Wednesday, he struck a more positive note, saying the landmark Paris climate accord ‘has made a difference,’ as he opened the summit. ‘In the last 10 years, projected global temperature rise has dropped from four degrees Celsius to less than three,’ he said. Part of that progress stems from China. A decade ago, three-quarters of its electric mix came from coal — a figure now down to half. Its booming exports of solar panels, batteries, and electric cars are cutting emissions abroad as well.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/277159/china-unveils-specific-emissions-targets", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 651},

Sabina Yasmin, one of the alleged victims, lodged the complaint with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, said her lawyer, Md Zakir Hossain. After recording her statement, Metropolitan Magistrate Ariful Islam directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to probe the allegations and submit a report by November 11. The accused foundation officials are senior verification officer Iftikhar Hossain, officers Sagar, Mehedi Hasan Prince, Afzalu Rahman Sayem, Saidur Rahman Shahid, Fatema Afrin Payel, Reza Tanvir, Alif, and Jahid, and executive member Sabrina Afroz Srabonti. The other accused are Sonia Akhter Lubna, Rakin, and Shamim Reza Khan, whose designations could not be known immediately. According to the case statement, during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement on July 19, 2024, Sabina’s husband, Bulbul Sikder, sustained a severe leg injury, while their son suffered a severed nerve in his leg on the Dhaka–Chittagong Road. Following the fall of the Awami League government, the couple visited the foundation’s office on March 20 this year seeking recognition and compensation as July Uprising victims. There, Iftikhar and several others allegedly interrogated them, took Bulbul to a separate room, and tortured him for hours. Sabina was also reportedly beaten and threatened. The accused branded them as ‘fake July warriors,’ tried to force false confessions, and seized Sabina’s bag and mobile phone, the complaint said. Bulbul later suffered mental trauma and required medical treatment. Responding to the allegations, the foundation’s chief executive officer, Kamal Akbar, told New Age that Sabina and Bulbul had been accused of paying a woman from Narayanganj to include Bulbul as a ‘July warrior.’ He said the woman was earlier jailed in a case filed by the foundation for endorsing fake July warriors and had recently been released on bail. ‘Sabina and her husband came to the foundation on March 20, and some July warriors protested after learning about the allegation. One of our officials, Shahid, helped them leave the office safely,’ Kamal said. ‘I don’t know why the case was filed six months after the incident. The CID can investigate, and if anyone is found guilty, the foundation will not shield them. All the accused are dedicated officials,’ he added.

An interim government, which took over after two days of protests last week, declared the day of mourning ‘in honour of those who lost their lives during the protests’, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement. Protests began on September 8, sparked by a short-lived ban on social media, but fuelled by anger at corruption and long-standing economic woes. At least 19 people were killed in a crackdown on the first day. Anger over the deaths escalated, triggering an outpouring of rage nationwide, with government offices, a Hilton Hotel and other buildings set on fire. ‘The changes we are witnessing today would not be possible without the courage and sacrifice of those who gave their lives during the protests,’ Hami Nepal, a key organisation in the protests, posted on social media. Prime minister Sushila Karki, a 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protester demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months. Karki has declared the victims martyrs, promising state honours at their cremations. Shopkeeper Pooja Shrestha, 22, said that the day of mourning would bring people together. ‘Everyone is sad about what happened, the loss of lives — all young people like us,’ she said. ‘Things have improved now, and we hope the new government will bring the changes we need.’ A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447.

Having questioned the mindset that education reform was not necessary, the BNP standing committee member asked if the previous regime took education to its highest level, leaving no room for further improvement. His remarks came on Thursday at a discussion meeting organised by Nagarik Oikya at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the capital. Moyeen Khan at the time also said that the status of the teachers under the government’s Monthly Pay Order system was low and their treatment was also poor. He called ‘heart-rending’ and ‘shameful’ the recent use of tear gas and baton charge by the police to disperse the teachers demonstrating for pay rise and other facilities. Criticising the government for increasing the house rent allowance by only Tk 500, he questioned how teachers would be able to manage expenses with such paltry amounts. The event was chaired by Nagarik Oikya president Mahmudur Rahman Manna. Calling teachers the ‘makers of human beings’, Moyeen Khan said that no country could achieve prominence without a strong education system supported by dedicated teachers and students. If the public administration employees or the police received generous benefits, the same should be provided to teachers too, he said. Moyeen Khan further criticised the past 15 years of Awami League regime’s policy, alleging efforts to undermine education by devaluing teachers, destroying textbooks, and dismantling school and university courses. He reminded the meeting that the 2024 Anti-Discrimination Movement stemmed from the demand for fair opportunities in the public service jobs without any discrimination. He also observed that the main dissatisfaction arose from the appointment process through the Public Service Commission and questioned whether students were pursuing education for nation-building or merely for personal career advancement. Moyeen Khan also warned against the idea of an upper house for professionals who have not been elected by people. He said that while engineers, doctors and other highly qualified professionals played a crucial advisory role, they could not make decisions about the country’s governance without a public mandate.

So, to protect and promote the universal rights to education and health are requisites for all aspects of social and economic development. Two articles, 17 and 28, of the constitution entrench universal rights to education, especially free primary education, as well as rights to freedom of choice to get the higher education keeping to everyone’s potential and merit. Article 18 (1) highlights the state’s primary duty to raise the nutrition level and to improve the public health. So, the constitutional mandate and the given commitment to the several international conventions such as United Nations’ Convention on Child Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights oblige obligate Bangladesh to ensure free access to quality education and improved health services. Despite being the basic human right, the constitution does not recognise the health right as the universal human rights. The global development framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, commits to leaving no one behind, which is a great premise to working together with international development partners to provide quality education and health services for all.

National statistics show that 40.72 per cent of children and youths are out of education because of multifaceted causes as well as the maternal and under-five child mortality rates are 163 per 100,000 live births (maternal mortality) and 30.6 deaths under 1000 live births (under-five mortality) respectively. This clearly indicates the state could not protect the education and health rights as the universal human rights. In addition, 51.4 per cent of girl children are married off they reach 18 and 11.3 per cent of children are engaged in labour. This is also a gross violation of children’s rights to development with their full potential. The disparities between rural and urban education and health services in terms of access to and the quality of services are unimaginable. The people in several poverty pockets such as delta, coastal and haor areas do not have minimum level of access to health care services and to quality education. There are union health complexes and government primary schools, but they are almost completely dysfunctional for lack of resources, isolation, negligence of the national and local government authorities, overlooking and exclusionary approach and the frame of mind of the political and community leaders, prevailing rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability and people’s ignorance and lack of voice for their rights and entitlement. However, only in some big cities, particularly in the capital city, a very few education and health facilities and institutions provide acceptable standards of health and education services. But that are expensive and completely out of reach of ordinary people. Only the affluent group of people, about 10 per cent of the population, can afford this good quality of health and education services. And, almost 90 per cent of the population and all of rural and marginalised people, who are penniless and powerless, receive education and health services from the dysfunctional and retrospective facilities and systems. As a result, not only individuals face the adverse impact of the dysfunctional health and education services, but also national development also suffers in all aspects. The health and education services have completely been turned into business through the hegemonic political systems and monopoly and manipulative business approaches. Good quality of education and health service systems are the main engines of all kinds of development, economic and social. But keeping the majority portion of the population out of the quality services, a country cannot get on the development highway. Research shows that one dollar’s investment in education and health sectors generates more than one dollar’s return; but in all other sectors, it creates less than one dollar’s return. It proves that the rates of returns on investment in education and health sectors are much higher than that of another sectors. The good quality of education and health services is also the most effective tools to achieve the sustainable development, including poverty alleviation and building resilience of individual, community and systems to climate change, natural and artificial shocks and disasters. Definitely, the constraint of resources — financial and expertise — is a challenge to provide good quality of education and health services as the national budget allocation is much less than what is required. Along with this limited resource allocation, rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability, political engagement of professionals, monopoly business approaches, denial of human rights and the lack of the rule of law destroy the education and health systems. A comprehensive, rights-based-approach is required to enable both parties, service recipients and providers, as rights holders and legal and moral duty bearers respectively so that they can effectively perform their duties in all kinds of businesses and services. The marginalised and excluded section of the population as rights holders need to be able enough to receive technical and non-technical supports to claim their rights and entitlement accordingly. A rights-based approach is complementary with humanitarian and democratic norms, the rule of law, transparency and accountability and it impacts well-being, progress and prosperity. It is imperative to create such an inclusive, integrated and rights-based business environment and platforms that help to attain the expected outcomes, promoting ethical business standards with humanity and prohibiting unethical and illegal business that only makes money. So, improvement in the quality of education and health services requires some important policy and strategic actions. Demonstrating strategic, visionary and people-centric leadership would dismantle the hegemonic myths, bringing all actors together to the playground with the highest standard of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Business syndicates of rights-based services systems over the monopoly and manipulative business systems in education and health sectors should be eliminated. Primary and essential health care and services must be free for all people and specialised health services must be affordable for the rural poor and marginalised people with an equitable access to good public health. Physicians must stay in community and union health complexes and provide specialised health services for rural people. Public and private partnership should be attempted at to address the challenges of resources constraints. The marginalised and excluded groups should be empowered to protect their rights to quality services. The government implements social safety net programmes to support the extreme poor and people with disabilities, but that is not effective because of political bias, corruption, abuse, exploitation and exclusion. Rights-based, service-oriented education and health systems should be established. It is essential to raise the floors of the extreme poor and marginalised people with education and empowerment programmes and initiatives so that they can raise their voice for their rights and entitlement. It is imperative that Bangladesh now should implement a comprehensive reform initiative, but no reforms will sustain in the long run if the reforms do not focus on education and health systems.

{"title": "Reshaping livestock sector", "body": "IN THE quiet glow of a Bangladeshi dawn, long before cities stir, the day begins in a rural courtyard. A woman scatters feed for her poultry, checks the calf born only days ago, and prepares fodder for the cattle tethered under a tin shed. What appears to an outsider as an ordinary domestic ritual is, in truth, the daily pulse of Bangladesh’s rural economy. It is against this deeply embedded backdrop that the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock has announced ‘National Livestock Week 2025,’ to be observed from November 26, to December 2. Although Dhaka will host the inaugural events, exhibitions and policy seminars, the essence of this initiative lies far from the capital, in the muddy lanes of sixty-four districts and the scattered upazilas where livestock rearing remains the primary lifeline for millions, particularly for those who live at the most fragile edges of poverty. To understand the significance of this observance, one must look at livestock not through the lens of commodity markets, but from the perspective of rural households that treat animals as a form of living savings. A Black Bengal goat, a deshi cow, even a small flock of ducks becomes a form of security at times when crops fail, illness strikes, or sudden expenses emerge. Livestock keeps the poorest afloat when shocks hit, and it does so with an immediacy that formal financial systems often cannot provide. This role becomes even more pronounced for women, who have long carried the invisible but foundational labour of household-based livestock rearing. In a society where women’s financial autonomy remains constrained, poultry and dairy work has served as a quiet but transformative means of empowerment. The income generated from eggs, milk, or the sale of a fattened cow during Eid-ul-Adha frequently becomes the money that educates a child, restores a leaky roof, or keeps a family solvent after a bad harvest. National Livestock Week, in recognising these contributions, seeks to bring rural women and smallholder farmers to the national stage. The introduction of the ‘Livestock Medal 2025’ is not simply a token of appreciation; it signals an effort to legitimise livestock rearing as a dignified and indispensable profession within Bangladesh’s development narrative. The week itself has been designed as a bridge between policy ambition and lived rural realities. The inauguration at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Center sets the tone, followed by an exhibition and food festival that foregrounds the diversity of animal protein in Bengali cuisine. Subsequent days shift focus from celebration to introspection, examining structural challenges, unpacking technological possibilities, and mapping the sector’s long-term economic potential. Seminars on research and technology emphasise the need to move beyond subsistence-oriented methods and into more resilient, commercially viable systems. Discussions on export diversification reflect a broader national urgency as Bangladesh prepares for a post-LDC economic landscape where processed meat, hides, and animal-based products may contribute significantly to the export portfolio. The programme also situates young people and women at the centre of future livestock entrepreneurship, encouraging them to view the sector not as a fallback option but as a viable professional frontier. Meanwhile, in districts far from Dhaka’s seminar halls, free vaccination and veterinary camps aim to address the most immediate needs of farmers, an intervention far more consequential to them than any high-level panel discussion. Government initiatives in recent years suggest a more structured attempt to bridge longstanding gaps between urban demand and rural supply. Artificial insemination services are being expanded to improve local cattle breeds, allowing households to earn more without expanding herd size. Peri-urban farming is receiving targeted support as mega-cities grow and protein demand escalates. Digital tools, ranging from animal-health tracking apps to online cattle markets, are gradually integrating informal rural practices into wider economic networks. These interventions require sustained investment, yet their early impact indicates that a more efficient and interconnected livestock economy is already beginning to take shape. No discussion of livestock can ignore the reality of climate vulnerability. Rising salinity in coastal zones, flash flooding in the haor regions, and heat stress across the plains pose direct threats to cattle, poultry, and fodder. National Livestock Week, therefore, is not merely celebratory; it serves as a forum to confront the existential risks facing the sector. Climate-smart livestock strategies, such as promoting saline- and heat-tolerant breeds, constructing raised ‘killa’ platforms for flood protection, and encouraging waterlogged-resilient fodder cultivation, are essential to safeguarding the assets of communities that have little else to fall back on when disasters strike. Protecting livestock, in this context, is inseparable from protecting human survival and the economic stability of climate-exposed families. Looking ahead, the sector’s potential extends well beyond its traditional confines. Global demand for halal meat presents an opening for Bangladesh to develop a robust export industry, provided hygiene and certification standards are consistently upheld. Improvements in animal health management could revitalise the leather industry, long undermined by poor-quality raw hide. Food safety, ensuring that milk and meat are free from dangerous antibiotics and steroids, remains an urgent concern, and one that the week’s seminars rightly seek to address. These aspirations align with the broader goals of a ‘Smart Bangladesh,’ where technology, sustainability, and inclusive economic growth converge. Ultimately, National Livestock Week 2025 functions as far more than a ceremonial exercise. It is a reaffirmation of the country’s commitment to the people who sustain its rural economy, often with little acknowledgement and even less institutional support. It honours the widow in a char village who keeps goats to survive, the young entrepreneur who invests in a dairy start-up, and the millions who depend on livestock for income, nutrition, and dignity. By blending modern science with the long-cultivated resilience of rural households, Bangladesh has the opportunity to reshape its livestock sector into a cornerstone of national prosperity. The revolution that begins quietly in the courtyard each dawn may yet become one of the driving forces of the country’s economic future.

{"title": "Truth commission needed to expose economic crimes: Lutfey", "body": "Bangladesh needs a truth and reconciliation commission to uncover how decades of economic crimes and defaulted loans were created, said Lutfey Siddiqi, the chief adviser’s special envoy on international affairs. He made the remarks on Thursday at a Policy Research Institute event titled ‘Bank Failures and Resolution Regime: Understanding the Challenges for Bangladesh.’ Siddiqi said that the scale of the banking crisis now requires full transparency about how non-performing loans grew to such levels, who benefitted from the system, and what institutional gaps allowed the damage to accumulate. He said that the true NPL ratio has crossed 35 per cent, far higher than levels seen during major global and regional financial crises. ‘This has not been a victimless crime,’ he said. ‘The costs are real and have affected people across the country.’ He said experiences from countries hit by the Asian financial crisis show that ignoring banking weaknesses eventually leads to deeper economic pain. He warned that that Bangladesh’s high NPLs, governance failures and politically driven lending have turned banks into risk amplifiers instead of stabilizing institutions. Siddiqi also linked the banking crisis to broader macroeconomic pressures. Inflation, unstable interest rates and limited fiscal space have narrowed the government’s ability to respond. He noted that Bangladesh now spends about 22 per cent of its tax revenue on interest payments, which he described as a major burden on a slowing economy. He said that recovery depends on turning deposit growth into productive investments, which is only possible if banks improve governance at the board and management levels. If bank leadership simply shifts from one political patronage network to another, the entire reform chain collapses, he said. He called for stronger conduct standards, independent oversight and credible leadership across the sector. In a keynote presentation, Ashikur Rahman, Principal Economist at PRI, said Bangladesh remains stuck with high inflation, high interest rates and low investment because distressed banks have not been resolved and bad loans continue to rise. Passing the Banking Resolution Ordinance is only half the job, he said. Effective resolution requires operational capacity, including skilled supervision, proper asset valuation, recovery tools and clear decision-making systems. Without these, he said, the ordinance will stay a promise on paper. PRI chairman Zaidi Sattar, who chaired the event, said the NPL level is unprecedented, even compared to countries hit by the global financial crisis. Many distressed banks in Bangladesh are too toxic to fail, he said, because letting them collapse would spread shocks across the system. He added that early signs show the sector’s bleeding has slowed and said growth could reach 5 per cent next year if political stability improves. Bangladesh Bank Chief Economist Mohammad Akhtar Hossain said NPLs and political uncertainty are already discouraging foreign investors, worsening an already low FDI-to-GDP ratio. Prime Bank chairman Tanjil Chowdhury said that wilful defaulters must not be rehabilitated or given new loans and urged clearer rules on family ownership in bank boards. Association of Bankers, Bangladesh chairman Mashrur Arefin said that no bank should be allowed to fail in Bangladesh’s context and supported the merger of five troubled banks, noting that several weak banks in the past eventually became strong performers.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/284865/truth-commission-needed-to-expose-economic-crimes-lutfey", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 526},

{"title": "Visiting Swedish human rights envoy meets govt, civil society representatives", "body": "Sweden’s ambassador for human rights, democracy and rule of law, Irina Schoulgin-Nyoni, arrived at Dhaka on Tuesday evening in a four-day visit when she is scheduled to meet with representatives of the interim government, civil society, development partners, students and media actors. Her visit would focus on key human rights issues, including the rights and empowerment of women and girls, freedom of expression and media freedom, and the role of civil society in promoting democratic values, said a press release of the Embassy of Sweden in Dhaka issued on Wednesday. It mentioned that Sweden had a long-standing commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights globally, reflected in its decision to appoint an ambassador dedicated to human rights. The ambassador’s mandate includes advocating for human rights in bilateral and multilateral contexts, engaging with stakeholders around the world, and supporting Sweden’s foreign policy priorities in areas such as gender equality, democracy and rule of law. In Bangladesh, Sweden works actively to support human rights through development cooperation, political dialogue and partnerships with civil society. ‘The visit also highlights Sweden’s strategic partnership with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights,’ said the release. The collaboration began before the July uprising and was further strengthened through the OHCHR’s fact-finding mission, which produced key recommendations to advance human rights in Bangladesh. Sweden supports the implementation of several of these recommendations, including efforts to strengthen national institutions, promote accountability and nurture civil society, the release mentioned. A key milestone was the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Bangladesh government and the OHCHR in July 2025, establishing the country’s first dedicated OHCHR Mission. With flexible funding from Sweden, the OHCHR has been able to maintain its presence and deliver concrete results. This includes support to the Commission of Inquiry on enforced disappearances, which has documented nearly 2,000 cases. Together, Sweden and the OHCHR continue to promote justice, gender equality, and inclusive civic space, including support to the National Human Rights Commission, legal reform efforts and the empowerment of emerging civil society actors, particularly youth, said the release.

{"title": "Macron seeks new PM to end France crisis", "body": "French president Emmanuel Macron was on Thursday racing to find a new prime minister within a two-day deadline after the resignation of outgoing premier Sebastien Lecornu tipped the country deeper into political crisis. The presidency said late Wednesday that Macron would name a new prime minister within the next 48 hours, indicating the appointment would come by Friday evening at the latest. A declaration seemed unlikely on Thursday, with foreign ministers in Paris for talks on plans to help Palestinians after the Gaza war, then Macron due to attend a ceremony in the evening honouring a late justice minister who ended capital punishment. An announcement of a new prime minister looked more likely on Friday, and could even include a cabinet lineup, a source close to the president said. Lecornu told French television in an interview on Wednesday evening that he expected a new premier to be named — rather than early legislative elections or Macron’s resignation — in order to resolve the crisis. Unless Lecornu is reappointed, the new prime minister will be the eighth of Macron’s presidency. Lecornu resigned early Monday after less than a month in office but Macron gave him up to Wednesday evening to find a way out of months of deadlock over an austerity budget. Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. The president ‘will name a prime minister within 48 hours’, the presidency said, adding a ‘path was possible’ to agree a budget by the end of the year. The escalation of the crisis has turned into the worst political headache for Macron since he came to office in 2017, with close allies deserting a head of state who now appears increasingly isolated. Former prime minister Edouard Philippe said that Macron himself should step down and call snap presidential polls. But Lecornu insisted the president should serve out his mandate until 2027, saying it was ‘not the time to change the president’. Suggesting that a more technocratic government could be named, Lecornu said people in a new cabinet should not have ‘ambitions’ to stand in the 2027 presidential elections. ‘We need a team that decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country’s problems until the presidential election,’ he said. Rumours swirled on Thursday on who could be prime minister. A person close to the president said Jean-Louis Borloo, a former minister under right-wing presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, could be a potential candidate. But the 74-year-old centrist said he had heard nothing of it and had ‘zero’ contact with the president’s office. Whoever is named the new prime minister will likely face the same problems encountered by Lecornu and his two immediate predecessors, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou, who were both toppled by parliament. After losing their majority in 2022 elections and ceding even more seats in snap polls last year, Macron’s centrists have governed in a de facto coalition with the right-wing Republicans. But even this combination is a minority in parliament, and any premier risks being voted out again if the left teams up with the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. Le Pen said Wednesday she would thwart all action by any new government and would ‘vote against everything’. Le Pen’s anti-immigration party senses its best ever chance of winning power in the 2027 presidential elections, with Macron barred from running having served two terms. Critical to its hopes of survival could be the Socialists, who Macron has long tried to woo away from a broad left-wing alliance. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure emerged from a meeting with Lecornu earlier Wednesday, lamenting that the premier had ‘given no assurance’ on a key request, that a hotly contested 2023 pension reform would be suspended.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/278562/macron-seeks-new-pm-to-end-france-crisis", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 627},
{"title": "Govt borrowing surges as fiscal strain deepens", "body": "Government borrowing from the country’s banking sector has surged as weak revenue mobilisation and a slowing economy have pushed the interim government to rely heavily on banks to fund day-to-day operations. Bangladesh Bank data show that government borrowing from the banking sector climbed to Tk 45,239 crore in the July 31–December 8 period of the 2025-26 financial year, marking a reversal from net negative borrowing of Tk 503 crore in July–October. The figure also surpassed borrowing of Tk 28,549 crore recorded in the same period of 2024, pointing to mounting fiscal stress as revenue mobilisation lags behind expenditure needs. The data also indicate that in the July 31–December 8 period, the government borrowed Tk 22,011 crore directly from the Bangladesh Bank and Tk 23,227 crore from commercial banks. As a result, the outstanding government borrowing from the banking sector climbed to nearly Tk 6 lakh crore on December 8. Economists warned that borrowing from the central bank injected high-powered money into the economy, which could intensify inflationary pressure at a time when commodity prices remain elevated and the monetary policy was already tight. Borrowing surged from late November as the government sought funds to meet operational expenses with the year-end approaching. Bankers said that borrowing pressure would persist as the government faced a sizeable budget deficit amid sluggish tax collection and a fragile economic recovery. The government’s heavy reliance on banks for borrowing is also squeezing credit to the private sector. The private sector credit growth dropped to 6.23 per cent in October, the lowest in 23 years, reflecting weak investment demand and banks’ growing preference for lending to the government. M Masrur Reaz, chairman and chief executive officer of the Policy Exchange Bangladesh, a private sector economic and investment advisory platform, told New Age that the surge in government borrowing primarily reflected weak revenue mobilisation in the face of an expanding budget and a large annual development programme. He noted that borrowing pressure could ease if the government took stronger steps to reduce wastage, corruption and administrative mismanagement in both recurrent and development spending. Reaz cautioned that heavy reliance on bank borrowing risked crowding out private investment, as banks channelled funds to the government instead of businesses. He also stressed the need for diversifying the government’s sources of financing rather than depending excessively on the banking sector. Developing the capital market, broadening non-bank financing options and improving access to long-term funds would help ease pressure on banks and support macroeconomic stability, he added. Bankers said that many banks had lost lending capacity due to mounting non-performing loans, deposit withdrawals and rising cash outside banks amid high inflation. While weaker banks struggle with liquidity shortages, better-performing banks hold excess liquidity and prefer to invest in government securities rather than extending risky private loans, they said. The Bangladesh Bank has also restricted lending by several banks after detecting major loan irregularities and governance failures, further constraining private credit. For FY26, the government has set a net borrowing target of Tk 1.04 lakh crore from the banking sector and Tk 21,000 crore from non-bank sources to finance the budget deficit. The rise in government bank borrowing comes amid a rapidly expanding public debt burden. The total public debt increased to Tk 21.44 lakh crore at the end of June 2025 compared with that of Tk 18.89 lakh crore a year earlier, according to the Finance Division. Foreign debt stood at Tk 9.49 lakh crore, accounting for more than 44 per cent of the total public debt, compared with that of Tk 4.20 lakh crore in 2021. Domestic debt also expanded steadily, rising to Tk 11.95 lakh crore from Tk 10.76 lakh crore a year earlier and Tk 7.22 lakh crore in 2021. Rising debt has sharply increased interest payments. In FY25, the government paid Tk 1,32,460 crore in interest, equivalent to about 36 per cent of the total revenue collection. The National Board of Revenue collected Tk 3,70,874 crore in FY25, marginally lower than Tk 3,82,678 crore in FY24. The Finance Division projected that the total public debt would reach Tk 23.42 lakh crore by the end of FY26.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/economy/285421/govt-borrowing-surges-as-fiscal-strain-deepens", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 687},

The country’s new center-right president Rodrigo Paz on Wednesday announced an end to the subsidies used by leftist governments to freeze fuel prices for 20 years. The move is part of a package of reforms announced by Paz to end a deep economic crisis, blamed partly on the billions of dollars spent annually to keep fuel cheap. The fuel price increases, which took effect on Thursday, caused fares for buses -- the main mode of transport in the Andean country -- to double. Bus drivers took to the streets of the administrative capital La Paz, satellite city of El Alto and eastern economic hub of Santa Cruz to demand the subsidies be reinstated. They were joined in La Paz by traders, who said the fuel hikes were making their goods too expensive for customers. ‘For us, there is no Christmas anymore,’ Paulina Tancara, a 74-year-old small-business owner, told AFP, expressing her disappointment with Paz, whom she backed in the two-round August-October elections. Bolivia is experiencing a severe shortage of the foreign currency needed to import fuel and other essentials. Annual inflation rose to nearly 20 per cent in November. Previous attempts to eliminate the country’s cherished fuel subsidies have however encountered stiff resistance.

{"title": "Showpiece signals reflect Dhaka’s habit of superficial fixes", "body": "THE failure of automation attempts in Dhaka’s traffic management is both worrying and symptomatic of a broader inertia in urban governance. Despite repeated investments in automatic solutions, the city remains dependent on the manual traffic policing. The latest example is the automated traffic signalling system, launched only a month ago on a trial basis at seven crossings, which has already degenerated into a display without functional authority. Installed with the aim of reducing congestion and introducing predictability to road users, the signals now operate in parallel with manual direction, producing confusion rather than efficiency. Drivers still defer to police officers along Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, stretching across a strategic corridor from Shikkha Bhaban to the airport, even when lights turn green. This shows that technology has not translated into trust. Pedestrians, too, testify to their reluctance in relying on signals. The Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority insists that the system requires time for users to adjust to, yet such optimism appears thinly stretched when placed against earlier automation initiatives — countdown timers, digital boards, solar panels, remote controls and even so-called ‘intelligent’ systems — that have all lapsed into irrelevance. The present faltering of the trial signals cannot be read in isolation because it repeats a cycle in which automation is introduced with enthusiasm only to falter against the lived realities of Dhaka’s roads. Earlier initiatives promised to modernise traffic control but were eventually rendered ineffective by technical breakdowns, poor maintenance lack of integration and, above all, the absence of public trust. What is missing is not merely the hardware but a holistic approach that accounts for the behavioural patterns of drivers, the unpredictability of public demonstrations, the intensity of pedestrian flows and the institutional weaknesses of city authorities. Without addressing the fundamental challenges, the installation of further machines across the 22 crossings on this arterial corridor risks becoming another costly showpiece. A sustainable solution requires both engineering and sociology: sustained public education campaigns to familiarise citizens with signals, robust maintenance regimes to prevent collapse at the first breakdown, legal reinforcement so that drivers are compelled to comply and inter-agency coordination so that police, transport regulators and municipal bodies act in concert. Only when technology is embedded within such a systemic framework can automation hope to achieve credibility. Authorities should, therefore, treat the current trial not as an end in itself but as a starting point for comprehensive reform. Installing machines without ensuring behavioural change, enforcement and maintenance will only add to Dhaka’s long list of failed experiments. Automated signals should be integrated with strict compliance, sustained public education and institutional coordination. Only then can the city move beyond symbolic gestures and towards a credible system of traffic management that serves its citizens effectively.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/277422/showpiece-signals-reflect-dhakas-habit-of-superficial-fixes", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 453},

{"title": "AB Bank seeks Tk 2,000cr liquidity support from BB", "body": "AB Bank has sought Tk 2,000 crore of liquidity support from the Bangladesh Bank to continue smooth operations. The bank made the request in a letter to the central bank on November 11. Syed Mizanur Rahman, managing director and chief executive officer of AB Bank, confirmed the request, stating that the bank faced deposit withdrawal pressure amid growing public concern over the banking sector’s health. He explained that discussions about merging five banks and the central bank’s asset quality review of 11 more banks, including AB Bank, had spread panic among depositors. Despite the central bank governor’s assurance that no more banks would be merged at this time, Mizanur said that depositors remained worried. He noted that customers who could not access their funds after the merger of five Shariah banks had created concerns about other banks’ stability. Many worry AB Bank might end up like those five crisis-hit banks, where depositors still struggle to withdraw their money, prompting customers to withdraw their money. BB officials said that the central bank in principal decided not to provide any more liquidity support to any bank considering inflationary pressure. Earlier, the BB pumped Tk 35,000 crore of liquidity support into nine struggling commercial banks, including AB Bank, but saw little turnaround, they said. Non-performing loans of AB Bank jumped to Tk 22,279 crore at the end of 2024, which was 67 per cent of the bank’s total loans and advances, according to annual of report for 2024. The bank reported Tk 3,113 crore net loss in January-September 2025 against Tk 1.58 crore of profit in the same period last year. AB Bank said that profit had been decreased due to decrease of interest income and non-interest income. Interest income decreased because of increased non-performing loans and interest expense. It accounted Tk 1,905 crore losses in 2024 against Tk 89.37 crore net profits in 2023. Therefore, the board of directors of the bank recommended no dividend for the year ended December 31, 2024, after five years of the continuously providing dividends.

{"title": "Sought by luxury labels, Nigerian leather reclaims home market", "body": "Most Nigerian leather, often semi-finished, is exported to Europe and Asia and turned into luxury items bearing international brand labels, with zero trace of its origins. But with her homegrown brand, Isi Omiyi creates high-end pieces to try to reclaim Nigeria’s leather identity. In her apartment in the Lagos metropolis, she has created a boutique corner where bags, wallets and shoes are carefully displayed on shelves, some carrying price tags of up to $1,500. ‘Leather is part of our heritage. I can’t just stand by and watch others receive all the credit for work that we started here,’ the 56-year-old designer told AFP. Her mission is to amplify ‘Made In Nigeria’ craftsmanship. She ‘would like these foreign brands to indicate on their products: ‘originally from Nigeria’ and ‘made in Italy’, ‘made in France,’ or elsewhere, because most of them don’t,’ Omiyi said. According to the country’s export promotion agency, Nigeria exports 90 per cent of its leather, mainly to Italy and Spain, which make up around three-quarters of the total volume. Leather exports generate about $600 million in annual revenue, said Oluwole Oyekunle, a researcher at the Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology in Samaru in northern Kaduna state. In Kano, a state in northern Nigeria, major international luxury brands source leather through intermediaries, who link them with tanners. The state counts 11 tanneries. Ztannery, operational since 2010, takes daily delivery of dozens of fresh hides of goats and sheep from across Nigeria and neighbouring countries. They are sorted and treated over nine days. ‘We process from zero to semi-finished leather, which is 80 per cent of the whole process,’ said company owner Abbas Hassan Zein, 47. Intermediaries ship the hides to Europe, where they undergo further treatment before being sold to luxury brands like ‘Gucci, Ferragamo, Prada, Louis Vuitton, all the big names’, Zein added. ‘And this is where the process goes from ‘Made in Nigeria’ and the balance 10 per cent of the finished leather is lost and becomes ‘Made in Italy’ or ‘Made in China,’‘ he added. Modern tanneries with state-of-the-art machinery like Ztannery only accept large orders paid in dollars or euros, cutting off access by local designers who would pay in local currency. Many turn to the traditional Majema tannery, founded in 1932 in the heart of Kano city. Here, everything is done manually. Dozens of tanners clean and dye hides directly on the earthen floor amid plastic bags and bottles. ‘Our customers come from the north and south, and we also export to neighbouring countries such as Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Cotonou (Benin) and Europe,’ said tannery manager Mustapha Umar, 52, standing in front of goat hides hanging from wires, waiting to be dyed the next day. In 2017, Femi Olayebi, founder of the Nigerian brand FemiHandbags, created the Lagos Leather Fair, an annual event that brings together approximately 100 leather professionals in Nigeria’s commercial hub. ‘There was a need for a platform dedicated to designers, products and leather suppliers, demonstrating that Nigerians, with their own resources, are capable of creating items that are worth purchasing,’ said Olayebi. Public and private ventures are growing in the sector in Africa’s most populous country. In Kano, Indian, Chinese and some European producers — not necessarily from the big names — ‘have started showing interest of coming here to do the manufacturing’, said Tijjani Sule Garo, of GB Tannery, a family business spanning three generations. Back in Lagos, the state government in August launched a factory in the Mushin neighbourhood, with the target of producing leather goods and creating 10,000 jobs, located near one of the country’s largest leather markets. To compete against global leather industry giants, Olayebi stresses the need for ‘better machines, better access to high-quality Nigerian leather, and above all, better training’. For David Lawal, 26, brand executive for Morin.O, it all boils down to promoting Nigerian identity. Many customers seek a ‘timeless expression of heritage’, narrated through leather products created in Nigeria and crafted by Nigerians, said Lawal.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/277356/sought-by-luxury-labels-nigerian-leather-reclaims-home-market", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 665},

Referring to the September 28’s violence, which left at least 30 national minority people injured and three killed, they said that there were allegations of excessive use of force by law enforcement agencies, including the army. ‘No security force is above the rule of law and human rights,’ the statement reminded, adding that anyone involved in the use of excessive force — including members of the military — must be held accountable. The culture of impunity must end immediately. The signatories outlined a nine-point demand, which included an immediate and transparent investigation into the rape incident; exemplary punishment for the perpetrators, along with protection for the victim and her family; formation of an independent commission to investigate allegations of excessive force used by law enforcement; a fair trial for those involved in the violence; a review of the long-standing ‘militarisation policy’ in the hill regions as well as a push for a peaceful, political resolution to the ongoing issues in the area.

{"title": "Sylhet chamber polls postponed", "body": "The upcoming election of the Sylhet Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the apex business body in the region, was postponed on Sunday just five days before the scheduled voting, which was supposed to take place on November 1. The Ministry of Commerce issued an official directive in this regard on Sunday notifying the decision through a letter signed by Chowdhury Samia Yasmin, deputy secretary to the ministry’s Trade Division-1. According to the letter, the commerce ministry instructed the Sylhet chamber authorities to re-verify and scrutinise the membership list before announcing a fresh election schedule for the 2025-2027 executive committee. Though the letter did not specify the exact reason for the suspension of the voting, it emphasised the need for voter list verification of the SCCI. The SCCI administrator Farzana Akter Mita, also additional district magistrate, confirmed the suspension order to New Age and said that the letter issued by the ministry highlighted re-verifying the voter list. ‘Some members had earlier raised complaints of irregularities in the member list. In response, the ministry decided that the election will be rescheduled after proper verification of the membership list,’ she added.

{"title": "Factors in city juvenile offences", "body": "CHILDREN and teenagers often engage in various forms of delinquent behaviour due to a combination of personal, social and environmental factors. In recent years, juvenile crime has been gradually increasing in Bangladesh, particularly in urban areas. Children and adolescents in the country are increasingly becoming involved in criminal activities not only petty theft or school-based fights but also serious offences such as gang-related extortion, mugging, drug trafficking, and sexual violence. According to recent data from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, there are approximately 682 active juvenile offenders in the capital alone, often originating from high-crime neighborhoods such as Mohammadpur, Mirpur and Demra. The underlying causes include poverty, family breakdown, school dropouts, drug addiction, and peer pressure factors that push minors toward gang involvement. Meanwhile, national statistics reveal a concerning number of child victims of sexual violence: over the last decade (2015–2024), 5,632 cases of rape involving minors were reported. These trends indicate that juvenile delinquency in Bangladesh has become a significant social threat. Legally, Bangladesh seeks to protect minors under the Children Act 2013 (amended in 2018), which mandates special treatment for anyone under 18 who is arrested for a crime. The Penal Code also recognises that individuals aged 12–16 are considered juveniles when accused of offences. The intention is to provide age-appropriate justice: avoiding harsh adult-style punishment, ensuring rehabilitation and counselling and preventing the mixing of juveniles with adult criminals. However, in practice, this objective is often compromised: minors are sometimes tried in regular courts or deprived of proper legal representation and appropriate custodial conditions, undermining the protective aim of the law. As juvenile gangs increasingly commit serious crimes such as murder, drug trafficking and violent assaults, experts urge stronger enforcement of the juvenile justice framework, improved record-keeping, access to legal aid and the provision of rehabilitation services. Given these statistics and legal gaps, the role of schools, families and communities becomes even more critical. Preventive measures, emotional support and early interventions can reduce the likelihood of minors engaging in criminal behaviour. Without systemic reforms and increased social awareness, the rising trend of juvenile crime could worsen, threatening social stability and the future of many children across Bangladesh. Worldwide research shows that family conflict, poverty, peer pressure, online influence, school failure and the community environment are major contributors to juvenile crime. Similar patterns are observed in Bangladesh. Newspaper reports indicate a rise in gang culture, drug dealing, sexual harassment, mobile snatching, and school-based violence among school-going children. This study aims to identify the major triggers of juvenile crime, analyse the influence of schools, highlight incidents from Bangladesh, and provide recommendations for prevention. Family-related factors are a significant trigger for juvenile crime. Children from broken or abusive families often become psychologically vulnerable, increasing their likelihood of engaging in criminal behaviour. Lack of parental supervision when parents are busy or abroad also contributes to unmonitored and risky behaviour. Peer pressure is another strong factor, as adolescents are often influenced by friends to experiment with drugs, smoking, or minor thefts in order to fit in. Online influence is rapidly increasing; violent games, TikTok challenges, online gangs and other aggressive content encourage imitation and trigger aggressive behavior. In Chattogram (2021), a stabbing incident occurred due to a TikTok gang rivalry. Poverty and crime-prone community environments also play a significant role, as minors living in slum areas or neighbourhoods with heavy drug activity are more easily drawn into criminal behaviour. Academic pressure and school failure are common contributing factors; school dropouts or underperforming students may develop frustration that leads to risky behaviour. Most schools lack counselling facilities, depriving students of healthy emotional outlets. Additionally, punishment-focused school environments, harsh teachers, and unmonitored peer groups encourage ‘grouping’ behaviour on school grounds, which can escalate into gang formation, fights, and weapon use. Incidents in Bangladesh illustrate that juvenile crime is multidimensional. Examples include the 2021 stabbing in Chattogram due to TikTok gang rivalry, the 2022 school snatching gang in Mohammadpur, the 2023 student group attack in Mirpur, and the 2024 involvement of girls in a cyber harassment ring in Gulshan all of which demonstrate school-related or peer-influence triggers. These findings indicate that family crisis, school environment, peer influence and media exposure collectively shape juvenile crime. Although juvenile crime is increasing in Bangladesh, it can be controlled through proper intervention. A combined effort from schools, families and communities is essential. Schools should employ professional counsellors to monitor students’ mental health, enforce anti-bullying policies and provide teachers with training on positive discipline. Organising extracurricular activities, sports and creative programs can reduce idle time and mitigate the negative effects of peer pressure. At the family level, parenting education is crucial. Parents should be encouraged to maintain emotional communication with their children, monitor online activities, and avoid abusive behaviour. Community-level initiatives such as youth clubs, sports programs and safe neighbourhood projects can also help prevent juvenile crime. Collaboration between police and schools, along with early warning systems, can facilitate the identification of high-risk minors. At the governmental level, strict implementation of the Children Act 2013, reforms in juvenile courts and deployment of social workers in schools and communities are essential. Juvenile offenders must have access to legal aid, age-appropriate rehabilitation and separate juvenile courts. Awareness campaigns regarding child rights, relevant laws and penalties for adult exploitation of minors should be conducted to protect children and ensure effective enforcement of the law. A combined approach of these measures can prevent children and adolescents from entering a life of crime and safeguard the future generation.

{"title": "Zelensky in Paris seeking support, Trump pushes plan", "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday sought to reinforce European support for Ukraine at a potentially pivotal moment in Kyiv’s battle against the Russian invasion, meeting president Emmanuel Macron in Paris as Washington pushed a plan to end the war. A Russian missile attack killed four people and wounded nearly two dozen others on Monday in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the governor of the region said. Local officials released images of the aftermath showing emergency services responding at the scene, cars destroyed and buildings with their windows blown out. Zelensky held talks with Macron at the Elysee, with Ukraine weighing its options over the plan championed by US president Donald Trump but which European countries fear risks caving in to Russian demands. The situation has been further complicated by a corruption scandal that has rocked Zelensky’s inner circle and forced the removal last week of his top negotiator and chief of staff Andriy Yermak. Over three-and-a-half years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Kyiv is also under pressure on the battlefield as Russia’s offensive grinds forward. US and Ukrainian negotiators held hours of what both sides called ‘productive’ talks in Florida on Sunday, with Trump declaring on Air Force One ‘there’s a good chance we can make a deal’. ‘The work for peace continues,’ Macron wrote in a brief post on X after welcoming Zelensky for talks which were due wrap up with a press conference at around 1500 GMT. ‘There are some tough issues that still have to be worked through,’ Zelensky wrote on social media earlier Monday, following new telephone talks with Finland president Alexander Stubb, who has warm relations with both the American and Ukrainian leaders. Zelensky described the talks in the United States as ‘very constructive’, adding that decisions would be taken on Ukraine’s ‘further activities’ once the delegation returning from there had been debriefed. ‘It could be a pivotal week for diplomacy. We heard yesterday that the talks in America were difficult but productive,’ EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas added at a meeting of EU defence ministers. Washington put forward an initial 28-point proposal to halt the war, drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies and regarded as too close a reflection of Moscow’s maximalist demands on Ukrainian territory. It would have seen Kyiv withdraw from its eastern Donetsk region and the United States de facto recognise the Donetsk, Crimea and Lugansk regions as Russian. After talks in Geneva just over a week ago, the United States updated the original blueprint following criticism from Kyiv and Europe, but the current contents remain unclear. In an article for Britain’s Telegraph newspaper published at the weekend, Ukraine’s former armed forces chief Valery Zaluzhny offered a downbeat assessment of Ukraine’s predicament, saying that ’we are in an extremely difficult situation, where a rushed peace will only lead to a devastating defeat and loss of independence’. Zaluzhny, now ambassador to London and seen by some as a domestic rival of Zelensky, said that without security guarantees including Ukrainian membership of NATO, the ‘war will probably continue’ with Russia’s goal ‘the abolition of Ukraine as an independent state.’ Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff is due in Moscow for follow-up talks and is expected to discuss Ukraine with Putin on Tuesday. US secretary of state Marco Rubio told reporters the Florida talks were ‘very productive’ but there was ‘more work to be done’. ‘There are a lot of moving parts, and obviously there’s another party involved here that will have to be a part of the equation, and that will continue later this week when Mr Witkoff travels to Moscow,’ he said. The diplomatic push comes as the war — which has killed tens of thousands of civilians and military personnel and displaced millions of Ukrainians — shows no sign of easing. Zelensky is due Tuesday to make his first official trip to Ireland, which is not a NATO member but takes over the rotating EU presidency in the second half of 2026.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/283921/zelensky-in-paris-seeking-support-trump-pushes-plan", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 664},

The accident occurred during the ‘Velicham Veliyeru’, ‘Let there be light’, campaign meeting of Vijay’s party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, reported Hindustan Times. Health minister Ma Subramanian confirmed that the dead included 16 women, nine men and six children. The incident took place at Velusamypuram on the Karur–Erode highway, where nearly double the expected crowd turned up. Permissions had been granted for 30,000 attendees, but local reports suggested nearly 60,000 people gathered, overwhelming the venue. Witnesses said that the surge began at around 7:45pm when fans rushed toward the stage to see Vijay. Many fainted in the suffocating crush, and children were separated from their families. Several were trampled before police and volunteers could intervene. Television footage showed Vijay halting his speech, handing out water bottles to fainting supporters, and calling for police help. At one point, he was seen asking for a missing child to be located amid the chaos. Ambulances struggled to reach the injured as the ground was jammed. Volunteers formed human chains to clear paths. Many victims were taken to Karur district headquarters hospital, while others were shifted to Erode and Tiruchirappalli medical colleges. Officials initially confirmed 10 deaths, but the toll rose as hospitals reported casualties. Police sources admitted the crowd was far larger than estimated. Despite restrictions—such as barricades around the stage, designated entry and exit points, and a ban on road shows—the controls failed. ‘The entry points became chokeholds. The barricades could not handle the surge,’ said an officer. Reports suggested that some volunteers even encouraged the crowd to move closer when Vijay began speaking, worsening the situation. The district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry. A senior official said crowd-control failures were evident and promised accountability once evidence is reviewed. Tamil Nadu ministers announced relief of ₹5 lakh for the families of the dead and ₹50,000 for the injured. Chief minister MK Stalin is scheduled to visit Karur on Sunday. Opposition parties blamed both the ruling DMK government and Vijay’s TVK. AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami said that the tragedy could have been avoided with proper safety measures. TVK leaders expressed grief but defended their preparations. ‘We had followed all police instructions. The love for Vijay anna brought people in such numbers,’ spokesperson Bussy Anand said. Vijay, 51, one of Tamil cinema’s biggest stars known as ‘Thalapathy,’ launched TVK earlier this year. His party polled nearly 10 per cent in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, largely among young voters, and his state-wide campaign was seen as a bid to challenge the DMK and AIADMK in the 2026 assembly elections.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/south-asia/277377/31-killed-in-tamil-nadu-stampede", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 456},

{"title": "Kaspersky finds security flaws threatening vehicle safety", "body": "At Security Analyst Summit 2025 in October, Kaspersky presented results of a security audit that exposed a significant security flaw enabling unauthorised access to all connected vehicles of one automotive manufacturer, said a press release. Kaspersky researchers uncovered a critical security breach in a car manufacturer’s telematics system caused by a zero-day vulnerability in a contractor’s publicly accessible application. Exploiting this flaw allowed remote control over connected vehicles, including dangerous actions such as forcing gear shifts or shutting off engines mid-drive, it said. The breach originated from SQL injection vulnerability in the contractor’s wiki application, enabling access to user credentials and sensitive configuration data linked to the manufacturer’s telematics infrastructure. Further investigation revealed a misconfigured firewall and weak credentials, granting full control over the telematics system and access to the vehicle’s Controller Area Network (CAN) bus—making it possible to manipulate key vehicle functions. ‘This breach demonstrates how a single weak link in a contractor’s infrastructure can cascade into a full compromise of all of the connected vehicles. The automotive industry must prioritize robust cybersecurity practices, especially for third-party systems, to protect drivers and maintain trust in connected vehicle technologies,’ commented Artem Zinenko, head of Kaspersky ICS CERT Vulnerability Research and Assessment.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/281267/kaspersky-finds-security-flaws-threatening-vehicle-safety", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 201},
{"title": "Vietnam defies US tariffs with 8.2pc growth in Q3", "body": "Vietnam recorded economic growth of 8.2 per cent in the third quarter, among the highest increases in more than a decade, the government said Sunday, despite fresh US tariffs taking effect. Finance minister Nguyen Van Thang said the figure — excluding the surge in 2022 driven by a post-Covid recovery — was ‘the highest quarterly growth since 2011’, according to a government statement. The Southeast Asian manufacturing hub achieved growth of 7.96 per cent in the second quarter. Overall, from January to September, GDP growth was at 7.8 per cent year-on-year, Thang said. Vietnam has recorded ‘positive, outstanding and comprehensive’ achievements despite global economic headwinds and domestic challenges, including a costly typhoon season, the government statement added. The country has been battered by 10 strong storms this year, including Typhoon Bualoi, which triggered widespread flooding and landslides last week, killing more than 50 people and damaging homes, infrastructure and crops. The government has estimated total damage from natural disasters in the third quarter at more than $620 million. Vietnam’s economy grew 7.1 per cent last year and is aiming for eight per cent this year as it vies for ‘middle-income country’ status by 2030. However, the International Monetary Fund last month projected growth to slow to 6.5 per cent this year and ‘decelerate further in 2026 given the full year effect of the new US tariffs... and unwinding of most of the one-off 2025 government stimulus’.

{"title": "Extrajudicial killing on", "body": "The incidents of extrajudicial killing increased in the country in the past one year of the Professor Muhammad Yunus led-interim government compared to the previous year of the authoritarian regime. At least 35 people became victims of extrajudicial killing between August 2024 and July 2025 against 22 in the same period of the previous one year during the Awami league government, show rights body Ain o Salish Kendra data. The number of deaths in custody saw a slight decrease in the past one year, but the number of the victims is still high. Human rights activist Nur Khan Liton said, ‘We did not want to see a single incident of extrajudicial killing or custodial death and our expectation was that no such incident would occur during the interim government.’ But unfortunately, a number of incidents has taken place in the past one year, he resented. Nur Khan, former executive director of Ain o Salish Kendra, also said that probe should be conducted independently into the incidents to increase the confidence of people in the government, adding that otherwise the anger of people will increase. Noting that only one or two such incidents saw trial or investigation in the past, he said that almost all incidents were beyond trial or probe. Inspector general of police Baharul Alam, however, told New Age that he did not see any incident of extrajudicial killing in the country. Ignoring the incidents of extrajudicial killing, the IGP said, ‘We have no data regarding such incidents and it is not occurring.’ According to ASK data, at least 35 people were victims of extrajudicial killing in a year since August 2024. Of them, no such incident happened in August, five took place in September, three in October, one in November, three in December, five in January 2025, four in February, one in March, two in April, one in May, two in June, and eight in July. Besides, at least 69 people died in custody in the same period. Of them, four people died in August 2024, four in September, three in October, three in November, three in December, six in January 2025, 13 in February, five in March, six in April, seven in May, five in June, and 10 in July. However, the number of custodial deaths was 94 during the previous one year of Awami League regime. The interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus took office on August 8, 2024 after a student-led mass uprising toppled the autocratic regime of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina’s 15-year rule was tainted by widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, and enforced disappearances. Rights activists expressed concern over the increasing incidents of extrajudicial killing even in the tenure of Professor Yunus led-administration. Among the recent incidents, two people were found dead in the custody of the RAB and the Police Bureau of Investigation in Sylhet and Moulvibazar respectively in the past week. The deceased are Tanvir Chowdhury, 24, of Saradaganj village under Kashimpur upazila in Gazipur and Mokaddus Miah, 50, of Konagaon village of Kamalganj upazila in Moulvibazar district. Of them, Tanvir was found dead in RAB custody in Sylhet on September 14 and Mokaddus in PBI custody on September 15. Among publicised cases of recent killings at the hands of police and military forces, Touhidul Islam, 40, a leader of the youth-wing of the BNP, died in Cumilla on February 1 after being taken into custody by a military unit. Family members allege that he was tortured. According to data of rights body Odhikar, 4,266 people were extrajudicially killed between 2001 and 2025. Of the victims, 3,164 were killed in ‘crossfire’, 417 tortured to death in custody, 596 shot to death, 54 beaten to death, and 35 were killed due to other reasons. Police and Detective Branch were responsible for 2,386 incidents of extrajudicial killing while the Rapid Action Battalion was responsible for 1,277 such killings. Odhikar data show that 29 people were victims of extrajudicial killing in the past one year during the interim government tenure from August 9, 2024 to June, 2025. Of the victims, 11 were tortured to death in custody, 13 shot to death, and five beaten to death. Meanwhile, 2,703 people were extrajudicially killed during the 15 years of Awami League regime from January 2009 to June 2024. Of the victims, 2,062 were killed in crossfire, 182 tortured to death in custody, 421 shot dead, and 31 beaten to death. During the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and army-backed caretaker government period from 2001 to January, 2009, 1,534 people were extrajudicially killed. Rights organisation Odhikar’s director ASM Nasiruddin Elan said that the incidents of enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killing, and custodial deaths were a large-scale phenomenon during the previous government. Although enforced disappearance incidents did not occur in the past one year, the incidents of death due to torture and extrajudicial killing have still been happing, he said. Nasiruddin said, ‘Our expectation was a zero tolerance of such incidents during the interim government, but such incident have been occurring,’ Noting that any extrajudicial killing is unacceptable, he also urged the government to conduct fair probes into the incidents and take action against those responsible. One or two cases saw trial in such cases in the past, he added. Rights activists said that over the decades, extrajudicial killings in the names of ‘crossfire,’ ‘gunfight,’ and ‘encounter’ continued in the country, with almost every law enforcement agency being implicated. Alongside those recurring incidents, another consistent factor has been the absence of justice for such killings in the country. Data show that the police, the RAB, and other government law enforcement agencies have been involved in such incidents. In addition to the police and the RAB, the agencies accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings include the Detective Branch of police, Coast Guard, Border Guard Bangladesh, Cobra Team, and Ansar. On December 10, 2021, the United States imposed sanctions on the Rapid Action Battalion and seven of its officials over serious human rights violations. That year, 188 people were extrajudicially killed in Bangladesh. However, the following year, after the sanctions were imposed, the number dropped significantly to 51. After the RAB came under US sanctions, such killings decreased. Perhaps seeing the RAB’s situation the police authorities became cautious, said an observer. In 2011, Amnesty International, the global human rights organisation, published a report titled ‘Crimes Unseen: Extrajudicial Executions in Bangladesh’ said that ‘Such deaths (extrajudicial killings) were usually explained away as accidental, or claimed to have occurred in ‘crossfire’ when RAB officials allegedly opened fire in self-defence. In many cases, victims were killed after being taken into custody. Nevertheless, despite judicial inquiries by the RAB or the government into such deaths, no judicial action had ever been taken, it said. Extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, arbitrary detentions, and enforced disappearances are considered the four gravest forms of human rights violations. Yet, the National Human Rights Commission of Bangladesh has so far investigated only one case of extrajudicial killing. In February 2014, police from the Keshabpur police station in Jashore conducted an operation during which a man named Rojob Ali was killed in an alleged ‘gunfight’. After investigation, the NHRC concluded that the so-called gunfight was, in fact, a ‘shooting.’ The commission also pointed out inconsistencies in the police version of the events and stated that the claim of a gunfight was baseless. The investigation drew significant attention at the time. But it was the first — and the last — such probe by the NHRC, said the right activists.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/276553/extrajudicial-killing-on", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 1249},

The campaigning for the CUCSU elections, scheduled for October 15, ended on Monday. According to a notice signed by election commissioner and member secretary professor AKM Ariful Haque Siddique, the decision was made following applications from visually impaired students. The special booth will be located on the second floor of the CUCSU building, where two election commissioners will supervise and assist visually impaired voters during the casting of votes. Meanwhile, the Islami Chhatra Shibir-backed Shampritir Shikkharthi Jote panel demanded the formation of an emergency response team to handle complaints on the polling day. Speaking at a press conference held at Buddijibi Chattar at about noon, general-secretary candidate Sayeed Bin Habib said that a joint team consisting of university officials and representatives from all contesting panels should be formed to ensure swift and transparent resolution of election-related complaints. He alleged that the spread of false information and cyberbullying on social media had intensified ahead of the polls, and the administration had not taken visible action. Complaints about code of conduct violations have been submitted, but no effective measures have been seen so far, he said, adding that an emergency response team was essential on the polling day. Earlier in the day, candidates and their supporters of different panels were seen conducting last-minute campaigning in Zero Point, Station and Kolabagan areas, distributing leaflets designed after their electoral symbols including hand fans, guitars, birds, trophies and shuttle trains while seeking votes and good wishes from students. Some panels also used songs and street plays for campaigning. CUCSU assistant sports and athletics secretary candidate Chingsimong Marma said, ‘Unlike past student elections, no untoward incident has taken place this time. We are excited that our CUCSU election is being held in an orderly manner. We hope it will be festive and peaceful.’ When asked about any possible challenges, he said, ‘There is some uncertainty about whether non-residential students will come to vote. We are requesting them to take part in the voting spontaneously.’ Chittagong University, established in 1966, held CUCSU elections only six times: in 1970, 1972, 1974, 1979, 1981 and 1990.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/279012/cucsu-polls-electioneering-ends-vote-tomorrow", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 380},

{"title": "Lingering Typhoon inflicts death, flooding on Vietnam", "body": "Flooding from long-lasting Typhoon Bualoi devastated homes, infrastructure and farmland across swaths of Vietnam on Tuesday, with the death toll rising to 26 and dozens more missing. Rainfall from the storm inundated the capital Hanoi, bringing large parts of the city to a standstill and rerouting dozens of flights. Bualoi made landfall in central Vietnam late Sunday, packing winds of 130 kilometres per hour, and remained over land for almost 12 hours. It arrived in Vietnam after battering parts of the Philippines, where it killed 27 people and forced 4,00,000 to evacuate their homes. ‘This typhoon — the tenth that hit Vietnam this year — was a serious natural disaster, bringing a combination of strong winds, huge flash floods and widespread flooding,’ said Mai Van Khiem, head of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Its lengthy duration over Vietnam was ‘very rare,’ Khiem added. By Tuesday, the typhoon and its aftermath, had killed 26 people and injured more than 100 in Vietnam, the environment ministry said. Thirty others were missing. More than 1,36,000 houses were damaged, and several thousand families were stranded in central Ha Tinh province, the ministry added. ‘I have not experienced such a strong typhoon in several decades,’ Le Hong Luyen, 62, from Nghe An province said. ‘My house and garden are all flooded.’ The storm also devastated 225 square kilometres of rice fields and other cropland, uprooted tens of thousands of trees and downed electrical poles, causing power outages in several central areas on Tuesday. Disaster and weather authorities warned of rising river levels and possible landslides in mountainous areas. Heavy rain that began late Monday also caused widespread flooding in the capital Hanoi. ‘The floodwater reached almost the top of my motorbike. It was a terrible morning,’ said Hanoi resident Tran Thanh Huong, who spent two hours trying to reach her office on Tuesday morning before giving up. The flooding was the worst in the city since 2008, and had turned Hanoi into ‘a big pool,’ added resident Nguyen Luu Tien. ‘Cars and motorbikes were floating everywhere, even in the city centre,’ the 52-year-old said. Images on social media showed military trucks transporting children through flooded streets from a secondary school west of Hanoi, as parents elsewhere pleaded on Facebook for similar assistance in the city’s north. ‘It’s just water everywhere here,’ wrote one mother. Other schools said they would stay open for students and teachers who could not reach their homes. Poor visibility caused by the heavy rain forced the rerouting of dozens of flights headed to Hanoi’s Noi Bai airport, aviation authorities said. Vietnam is usually hit by up to 10 storms annually, but forecasters have warned it faces two to three more this year. Scientists say human-driven climate change is turbocharging extreme weather events like typhoons, making them ever more deadly and destructive. Storms caused Vietnam $371 million in damage from January to August, triple the amount over the same period last year, the General Statistics Office said. Last September, Typhoon Yagi killed hundreds of people in Vietnam and caused economic losses worth $3.3 billion.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/asia/277623/lingering-typhoon-inflicts-death-flooding-on-vietnam", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 513},
{"title": "IBBL fires 200 officers, makes 4,771 OSDs", "body": "Islami Bank Bangladesh PLC has terminated 200 officers and placed 4,771 others on special duty after they refused to take part in a qualification test designed to verify their recruitment. The move comes after years of allegations that thousands of staff had been hired through irregular processes under the influence of S Alam Group, which took control of the country’s largest Shariah-based lender in 2017. On September 27, the bank arranged a competency assessment for 5,385 officers through the University of Dhaka’s Institute of Business Administration. Only 414 attended, while the rest boycotted the test. Islami Bank additional managing director M Kamal Uddin Jashim said the move was intended to give officers an opportunity to secure their positions through a transparent process. ‘We wanted them to retain their jobs through an assessment, but most of them declined. Many of these officers repeatedly violated the bank’s code of conduct and professionalism, leaving us with no choice but to act,’ he told New Age. Officials said that after S Alam’s takeover, 7,224 people were recruited from Chattogram, more than 4,500 of them from Potiya, the hometown of S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam. Recruitment bypassed competitive job exams and public advertisements, with résumés collected through drop boxes at Alam’s residence and office. Even relatives of his household workers reportedly secured officer posts at the bank. Allegations of bribery and fake academic credentials are widespread, with nearly 2,500 officers submitting unverifiable certificates from private universities in Chattogram, the officers revealed. Investigations have already uncovered forged certificates among several staff, and action has been taken in some cases, they said. The bank officers said the assessment was necessary to restore internal discipline. Officials alleged that some of the officers threatened colleagues to prevent them from sitting the exam and later tried to incite unrest at the bank’s Potiya branch. Those who skipped the test have been barred from operational duties until further notice. In its official statement, Islami Bank said the test was fully lawful. It explained that a group of officers had filed a writ petition against the exam, but the High Court directed Bangladesh Bank to settle the issue. The central bank later ruled that Islami Bank, as a privately owned institution, had the authority to assess and retain staff in line with national laws. This initiative was essential to protect the bank from reputational damage caused by unqualified staff appointed in recent years, it added. With around 21,000 staff, Islami Bank is the country’s largest Shariah-based lender. But under S Alam Group’s control, the bank had reportedly allowed the withdrawal of around Tk 1 lakh crore, by named entities and anonymously, driving it to the brink of collapse. Bank insiders said many of the officers recruited during this period actively facilitated such irregularities. On August 21, 2024, Bangladesh Bank dissolved Islami Bank’s board to free it from S Alam Group’s influence and appointed independent directors on an interim basis.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/277553/ibbl-fires-200-officers-makes-4771-osds", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 488},

The BNP acting chairman said that the rise of anti-hegemonic nationalist politics in the country was ushered in by the Sepoy-People’s Revolution on November 7, 1975. ‘The Sepoy-People’s Revolution on November 7, 1975, in the history of Bangladesh is not merely a turning point but the genesis of anti-hegemonic nationalist politics in this land,’ he added. Extending greetings and congratulations to the people of the country on the day, he said, ‘The nation’s sovereignty was protected through the Sepoy-People’s Revolution. On this day in 1975, the soldiers and the populace, fueled by patriotism, took to the streets with the pledge of safeguarding national independence and reviving democracy. Thus, the historic revolution of November 7 is immensely significant.’ Tareque Rahman further said that the ruling group after independence, for its own self-interest, pushed the country into the grip of hegemony. ‘The objective was to cling to power indefinitely, which led to the killing of democracy through the formation of the one-party BKSAL rule. The BKSAL government, adopting extremely undemocratic and fascist methods, snatched away the legitimate rights of the people.’ He continued that during this dire national crisis, on November 3, 1975, conspirators imprisoned the proclaimer of the independence Ziaur Rahman and his family in the cantonment. ‘In this profound national crisis, the fearless soldiers and the surging crowds came together on the streets on November 7, resulting in a unique expression of solidarity to protect national independence, and the proclaimer of independence Ziaur Rahman was freed,’ he said. Tarique said that this change of scene, under the leadership of president Zia, instilled new vitality in the country, and democracy was unfettered, firmly establishing the freedom of speech, expression, and opinion. Peace returned to the minds of the people. ‘However, the domestic agents of the hegemonic forces, viewing president Zia as an impediment to their objectives, brutally assassinated him at the Chattogram Circuit House in 1981. Even though Zia embraced martyrdom, people inspired by his ideals remain united and firmly resolved to defend the nation’s independence and democracy.’ he added. Mentioning the brutal activities of fascist Awami League, he said, ‘Once again, the Awami fascists seized state power through covert conspiracy, destroying democracy for nearly 16 years.’ Tarique Rahman claimed that the nation’s sovereignty was weakened day by day due to their submissive policies. He accused the Awami League fascist government of suppressing pro-democracy activists with horrific cruelty, establishing a terrifying reign of corruption and misrule, including the use of aynaghar (secret detention centers), enforced disappearances, murders, and extrajudicial killings. He also lamented that the ‘symbol of democracy’, Khaleda Zia, was imprisoned for many years without a valid reason. He said that the fascists were compelled to flee the country due to the magnificent self-sacrifice of the students and the people on August 5. He believes the path to the liberation of democracy has now broadened for the people. Tarique Rahman said that to establish the ultimate practice of democracy, it is imperative to ensure people’s fundamental human rights, which are indispensable for democracy, and to hold a free and fair election. He also called for the establishment of justice and good governance in society.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/281422/tarique-rahman-urges-nationalist-forces-to-unite-in-november-7-spirit", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 583},

{"title": "Hungary to send team to Russia", "body": "Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban announced Saturday that he was sending a business delegation to Russia in the coming days in preparation of the end of the Ukraine war. Orban addressed Budapest’s foreign relations with Moscow and also Washington at an exclusive rally in the central city of Kecskemet, ahead of legislative elections in the spring. The delegation’s mission would focus on economic cooperation, particularly in a post-war landscape that could see Russia not cut out from the Western economy but rather reintegrated, he said. The nationalist premier is a rare European leader to be close to both US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He noted he was in discussions with both Washington and Moscow, although said he could not ‘share every detail’. ‘We have to think ahead, because if God helps us and the war ends without us being dragged into it, and if the American president succeeds in reintegrating Russia into the global economy and the sanctions are dismantled, we will find ourselves in a different economic landscape,’ Orban said. According to Hungarian press, the country’s MOL oil and gas firm is considering acquiring refineries and petrol stations in Europe owned by Russian groups Lukoil and Gazprom, both currently subject to US sanctions. Orban and Trump discussed this in a meeting early in November. In a late November visit to Moscow, Orban promised Putin he would continue importing Russian oil and gas, which Hungary remains dependant on, in defiance of the European Union. Unlike other European countries, Hungary has not diversified its imports since the February 2022 launch of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Orban also in November referred the matter of banning Russian national gas imports by the end of 2027 -- which was approved by the majority of EU states—to the EU Court of Justice.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/284504/hungary-to-send-team-to-russia", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 301},
{"title": "Current account remains positive in July", "body": "Bangladesh’s current account balance remained positive in July, first month of the financial year 2025-26 driven by a surge in remittance inflows and export earnings, alongside sluggish import growth reflecting weak investment demand. According to the latest data from the Bangladesh Bank, the current account posted a surplus of $245 million in July from that of $181 million deficit recorded in July, 2024. It was $981 million surplus in FY25, a dramatic turnaround from the $6.6 billion deficit in FY24. The last time the country saw a current account surplus in FY16, when it stood at $4.26 billion. Since then, persistent deficits continued for eight consecutive fiscal years until this reversal. The current account is a vital part of a country’s balance of payments (BoP), reflecting the net flow of goods, services, primary income (such as interest and dividends), and secondary income (mainly remittances). In July last year, business activities and financial transactions came to standstill due to month wide protests and shut down which led to fall of Awami League led government on August 5, 2024. A surge in remittance inflows and robust export earnings contributed to the reversal of the current account balance. The improvement in current account came primarily from a surge in secondary income, which includes remittances sent by Bangladeshi workers abroad. Remittance inflows jumped by nearly 29.5 per cent to $2.47 billion in July from $1.91 billion in the previous fiscal year. Overall secondary income rose to $2.52 billion, up from $1.95 billion in July last year. Export earnings also contributed positively, growing by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach $4.4 billion in July. However, the other indicators in the balance of payment, including trade deficit and financial account showed negative output in July. As import payments surged by 24.7 per cent, the trade deficit rose to $1.5 billion from $1.46 billion a year earlier. Moreover, the deficit in services trade rose to $482 million, down from $338 million in July last year, reflecting poor performance in sectors like IT services and transport. Despite the positive remittance trend, the country continued to post a deficit in its primary income account. This segment includes payments to foreign investors for interest, dividends, and compensation of foreign workers. The deficit in this category declined to $291 million, with $502 million in payments made abroad while income received totaled only $211 million. Despite the gains in current account and exports, the financial account of the BoP posted deficit of $718 million in July, compared with $263 million in July last year. As a result of these developments, the overall balance of payments hit deficit of $545 million in July compared with that of $693 million in July last year. As of July 24, 2025, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $25 billion, based on the IMF’s updated calculation methodology.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/276423/current-account-remains-positive-in-july", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 471},

{"title": "When crowd watches man burn", "body": "IN MYMENSINGH, a man named Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death. After his life had been extinguished, his body was tied to a tree in a public square and set on fire. Around him, a crowd gathered in total silence. Not a single voice rose to stop it. Not a single hand reached to intervene. Some recorded the scene on their phones; others simply stood, watching. In that silence, the crime became larger than the attackers, it became the reflection of a society that has stopped feeling, a conscience suspended, if not lost entirely. This was not a sudden, uncontrollable chaos. It unfolded in stages, in public, giving every observer the opportunity to act differently. Yet nobody did. That total passivity speaks to something far deeper than lawlessness: a moral collapse, a desensitisation so profound that witnessing atrocity is no longer shocking but banal. Psychologists describe this phenomenon as diffusion of responsibility and moral disengagement. In a crowd, individuals feel shielded by the presence of others. The mind rationalises: someone else will intervene, it is not my duty, I am merely an observer. Filming becomes a substitute for action; silence becomes complicity. Public indifference is not accidental, it is learned. Moral numbness grows where empathy is conditional, outrage is selective and violence is normalised as spectacle. When human life can be desecrated in public without anyone speaking out, something foundational has eroded — not only law, but the very fabric of humanity. The justification offered for Dipu’s killing, that he allegedly made comments about the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), reveals another layer of distortion. Nothing about this act aligns with the ethical teachings of Islam. The Qur’an is unequivocal: ‘Whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption in the land, it is as if he has killed all of humanity.’ (Qur’an 5:32) The life of the Prophet Muhammad demonstrates moral clarity. He endured insult, mockery and physical attack, yet he never sanctioned mob violence. He emphasised restraint, mercy and due process — even toward those who harmed him. Faith, he demonstrated, is measured not by anger or retaliation, but by moral courage and compassion. If the Prophet were to witness a body being burned in the street while bystanders remained silent, he would call it zulm — oppression. Religion without humanity is hollow. Justice without law is cruelty. It is time for Bangladesh and for the wider Muslim world to re-examine Islam and question what is being taught in madrasas across the country. But the issue is not confined to madrasas. It is the broader interpretation of Islam circulating in society: one that spreads fear rather than understanding, rigidity rather than reflection, obedience rather than ethical inquiry. Globally, distorted versions of religion have stifled progress. Countries like Iran and Afghanistan were once far more open, diverse and progressive. Today, they have been pulled backward, their societies shaped by rigid ideologies that prioritise control over human flourishing. If we do not question the religion we practice and the teachings we pass to our children, we are abandoning ourselves. Religion is, at its core, a quest for understanding, a path toward discovering our own selves and our purpose in this life. When that quest leads to moral paralysis, when it allows a crowd to stand silently while a man is burned alive, it is failing its fundamental purpose. Distortions of Islam have deep roots in history. During the Cold War, simplified and militant interpretations were encouraged as tools of geopolitical strategy. Religion became a weapon — mobilised, manipulated and hardened into a version of orthodoxy that departed from centuries of ethical scholarship and moral reasoning. Over time, these ideologies created societies where fear replaces reflection, obedience replaces conscience and violence is justified in the name of faith. The consequences are clear: crowds form before facts are known, rumours spread faster than reason and technology turns human suffering into spectacle. Empathy is replaced by detachment; moral courage by passive observation. And the cycle continues. Bangladesh must confront an urgent question: what are we teaching our people to feel? Laws alone cannot repair a society’s conscience. Arrests and condemnations after the fact cannot restore empathy that has been systematically eroded. If belief systems discourage ethical reflection and reward rage, mobs will continue to form, and bystanders will continue to watch in silence. An evolved society does not abandon faith. It returns to conscience. It teaches that belief demands responsibility, that justice requires process and that no crowd has the right to determine life or death. It teaches that mercy is strength and that restraint is moral courage. It teaches that religion is not a tool for fear or control, but a guide for understanding, self-discovery and the pursuit of a life worth living. A man was beaten to death in Mymensingh and his body was burned in public while the crowd looked on, silent. The question is not what he was accused of saying. The question is: what have we become and what will we do to reclaim our humanity?

To recapitalise the merged entity, the government will inject Tk 20,000 crore — half in cash and the rest half through Sukuk bonds — while Tk 15,000-crore institutional deposits will be converted into shares through a ‘bail-in’ process. This will bring the total paid-up capital of the new entity to Tk 35,000 crore against an authorised capital of Tk 40,000 crore. Shafiqul said that under the merger plan, no employee would lose job and no depositor would lose money. Initially, the new bank will operate under the ownership of the Finance Division. Once it stabilises and achieves operational efficiency, the government will gradually transfer its ownership to the private sector — a process expected to take about five years, the press secretary said. According to the plan approved by the advisory council, the shareholders of the five banks will not receive any compensation as all of the banks have negative net asset value and massive capital shortfall. The Bangladesh Bank has decided to appoint an administrator to each bank once the banks receive budgetary support from the government. Once the administrator is appointed, the board of the bank concerned will be dissolved and the managing director of the bank will lose job, BB officials said. The administrators will run the banks and proceed with the government’s merger plan. On September 7, the government approved the merger plan, pledging Tk 20,000 crore in budgetary support to facilitate the consolidation. As of September 28, 2025, the net asset value of First Security Islami Bank stood at negative Tk 438.81 per share, that of Global Islami Bank at negative Tk 117.72, that of Union Bank at negative Tk 224.97, that of Exim Bank at negative Tk 75.74, and that of Social Islami Bank at negative Tk 213.51. Their market prices have fallen to just Tk 1.6–3.7 per share, far below their face value of Tk 10, according to official documents. The merger aims to restore depositor confidence, re-establish accountability in the financial system and ensure sustainable credit flows to support economic growth. The Bangladesh Bank initiated the process after asset quality reviews by international consulting firms KPMG (Sri Lanka) and EY (Sri Lanka) exposed large volumes of classified loans, severe liquidity crises and capital shortfalls across six Islamic banks — the five banks and ICB Islamic Bank. However, ICB Islamic Bank was excluded from the merger due to the ongoing ownership-related litigation. The Bangladesh Bank’s assessment showed that despite providing liquidity support for over a year, the financial health of these institutions continued to deteriorate. As of May 2025, the five banks, which will be merged, together held deposits worth Tk 1,36,546 crore and outstanding loans worth Tk 1,95,413 crore. Of the outstanding loans, about Tk 1,47,000 crore or about 77 per cent turned into defaulted loans. Defaulted loan ratios were alarmingly high: 98 per cent at Union Bank, 96 per cent at First Security Islami Bank, 86 per cent at Global Islami Bank, 62 per cent at Social Islami Bank and 48 per cent at Exim Bank. The banks employ about 18,000 people and operate 780 branches and 698 sub-branches nationwide. The central bank has already developed a 10-year business and financial plan for the merged institution, projecting gradual recovery and eventual profitability. The planned merger marks Bangladesh’s first large-scale restructuring of Islamic banks under a formal framework. The move comes after a series of financial scams and reckless lending practices involving S Alam Group, which reportedly borrowed over Tk 1 lakh crore from the five banks through related companies. Much of the loan amount turned defaulted, leaving the banks cash-strapped and unable to meet withdrawal demands, forcing the regulator to intervene. Although the planned merger is seen as a bold step towards stabilising the country’s financial sector, it has caused worries for stakeholders. Depositors at the five banks fear a delay in accessing their funds, employees are anxious about possible joblessness and shareholders face loss of their investments due to the banks’ negative equity positions.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/banking/278538/cabinet-okays-merger-of-5-islamic-banks", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 823},

{"title": "Bangladesh Bank orders strict loan data updates to bar defaulters from election race", "body": "Bangladesh Bank has ordered all scheduled banks to promptly update loan repayment data as prospective lawmaker candidates, many of them business and political figures, scramble to clear defaults and overdue installments to remain eligible for the national polls. Managing directors of various banks, non-bank financial institutions, and Bangladesh Bank officials said they are receiving a surge in applications for loan regularisation. In response, the Credit Information Bureau of Bangladesh Bank has issued a strict directive to all banks and financial institutions nationwide, ordering rapid updates of loan-related data to confirm the financial eligibility of potential candidates. Bangladesh Bank officials said on Saturday that even if a borrower secures a stay order from a court, financial institutions must report the accurate status of the loan to the CIB without any alteration. The central bank emphasised that there will be no scope to conceal information or offer ‘arbitrary’ concessions. A special meeting was held on October 29 with CIB representatives from all banks and NBFIs, where institutions were informed of the government’s firm instruction to complete loan data updates before the election to ensure no loan defaulter can contest. ‘The Bangladesh Bank has made it clear that the government will not allow any loan defaulter to become a candidate in the upcoming election,’ said a CIB official. Arif Hossain Khan, executive director and spokesperson of Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is updating customers’ loan statuses as per government instructions. He added that providing updated credit information to Bangladesh Bank is a routine responsibility of banks. The central bank has also directed all institutions to strictly follow existing rules concerning borrowers attempting to reschedule long-overdue defaulted loans ahead of the election. No exceptions, special privileges, or rule violations will be permitted for rescheduling. All financial institutions, particularly those yet to submit their default data to the CIB, have been ordered to do so immediately. Updated reports detailing the full status of all new and ongoing loans, based on month-end outstanding balances, are mandatory. Banks have been specifically instructed to update the following information: Accounts of ongoing and settled loans, along with accurate balances and classification status, Maturity dates and overdue balances, Number and value of defaulted instalments, and details of installment payments or recoveries. To ensure round-the-clock verification of loan information for potential candidates, Bangladesh Bank has directed every bank branch to appoint a dedicated officer. Their names and mobile numbers must be submitted to the central bank. Electoral law clearly states that a candidate will be disqualified if their bank loan status is not classified as ‘regular’ up to seven days before the submission of nomination papers. Officials concerned believe this rigorous initiative by Bangladesh Bank will play a decisive role in preventing loan defaulters from securing nominations ahead of the election.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/282224/bangladesh-bank-orders-strict-loan-data-updates-to-bar-defaulters-from-election-race", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 461},
{"title": "Delay in air ambulance arrival may slightly push back Khaleda Zia’s departure", "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairperson Khaleda Zia’s departure for London for advanced medical treatment is now expected to be delayed until late Friday morning, as the special air ambulance provided by the Emir of Qatar may arrive in Dhaka later than initially scheduled due to technical issues, according to party sources. Besides, Zubaida Rahman, wife of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, is scheduled to reach Dhaka around 9:30am Friday to accompany her critically ill mother-in-law during the flight to the UK in the special aircraft. At a press conference at the party chairperson’s Gulshan office on Thursday afternoon, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the air ambulance was expected to arrive late at night. He later told UNB that ‘some technical problems’ have arisen which could delay its arrival. BNP media cell member Atiqur Rahman Rumon said Dr Zubaida Rahman is scheduled to fly from London around 6pm local time by a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight. ‘The flight is expected to land in Dhaka around 9:30am Bangladesh time,’ he said. Once in Dhaka, Rumon said Zubaida will travel back to London in the Qatar air ambulance with the BNP chairperson. Zubaida, who is also a member of the medical board formed for Khaleda’s treatment, has been monitoring her condition continuously through virtual consultations. Khaleda Zia, the 80-year-old three-time former prime minister, has been undergoing treatment at Evercare Hospital since 23 November after being admitted with multiple health complications. As her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to the Critical Care Unit on 27 November, where she remains under close observation. Doctors said Khaleda Zia is receiving intensive care for several complications related to her liver, kidneys and heart. BNP sources said Tarique and Zubaida have completed all arrangements for Khaleda’s treatment at London Bridge Hospital in the UK. Mirza Fakhrul said all necessary procedures for Khaleda’s travel have already been completed. ‘You may already know who will accompany her. A team of doctors will travel with Madam.’ The BNP leader said the royal air ambulance is equipped with modern medical facilities. ‘It has everything available, even an operation theatre.’ Earlier in the day, Khaleda’s personal physician and BNP Standing Committee Member AZM Zahid Hossain said she will be flown to London for advanced medical treatment. The decision was made unanimously by a medical board including local and foreign specialists, he told reporters at a briefing in front of Evercare Hospital in Dhaka. ‘She will be taken to London by a Qatar royal air ambulance. We have selected a hospital in London for her treatment and, InshAllah, we will take her there,’ he said. He said several specialist doctors and two foreign physicians will accompany Khaleda during the trip to the UK. Regarding her current condition, Zahid said every step has been taken strictly as advised by the medical board. ‘They advised that sending her to London at this stage is the most appropriate. We hope she will recover and return to us.’ On January 8, Khaleda Zia travelled to London in a special air ambulance sent by the Amir of Qatar for advanced medical treatment and returned home on May 6 in the same aircraft. The government has declared Khaleda Zia a ‘Very Very Important Person’ and deployed members of the Special Security Force to ensure her safety. Party sources said Khaleda will first be airlifted to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport by helicopter and then she will board the air ambulance.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/284146/delay-in-air-ambulance-arrival-may-slightly-push-back-khaleda-zias-departure", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 571},

{"title": "Govt needs to put in more capital to up education", "body": "THE return of World Teachers’ Day, held annually on October 5 worldwide since 1994 to celebrate how teachers transform education and to reflect on the support that they need to fully deploy their talent and vocation and to rethink the way ahead for the profession globally, is nothing but ritualistic observance for teachers, from primary to tertiary, in Bangladesh as they are faced with poor pay and allowances and low social status. And, such a situation continues to harm the education sector. There are about 1.28 million primary to tertiary teachers, as official documents say. But the average salary of a primary schoolteacher is $170.02, as the white paper on the state of the Bangladesh economy prepared towards the end of 2024 says, whilst the figure is $953.13 in the Maldives, $284.64 in India, $250.44 in Sri Lanka, $206.07 in Pakistan and $189.22 in Myanmar. The document says that lecturers in Bangladesh universities are paid between $220 and $482 a month whilst the figure ranges from $770 to $2,420 in India, from $700 to $2,800 in Malaysia and from $2,950 to $10,300 in Singapore. Such a proposition forces most teachers to do some additional work to add to their earnings. And, this holds them from deploying their talent and vocation to teaching. In addition, teachers are held not in high social esteem, even by official documents, which is evident in their pay scale. Lecturers enter public universities in Grade 9. Assistant teachers enter government secondary schools in Grade 12 and they can go up to the position of headteacher in Grade 6. Teachers of non-government secondary schools are not given house rent and medical allowance that their fellows in government institutions receive. Assistant teachers enter government primary schools in Grade 13 whilst the headteachers are employed in Grade 10. Even senior professors are placed between the ranks of 17 to 22 in the Warrant of Precedence 1986. And, teachers of all standings often take to the streets to demand an increase in their salary and allowance, when the law enforcers often deal with them high-handedly. The white paper also notes that teachers from primary to tertiary levels continue to be underpaid compared to their counterparts in other Asian countries. Non-government teachers often need to wait for years for their retirement benefits. The situation not only harms the teachers but also stops individuals with talent from taking up the profession of teaching, whether in primary schools or in public universities. But whatever ills happen in the education sector, involving education, students or teachers, stem from poor government spending on education. The theme for the day this year is ‘Recasting teaching as a collaborative profession.’ It is, indeed, time that the government recast the sector with increased spending to improve education and do away with all the ills.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/editorial/278152/govt-needs-to-put-in-more-capital-to-up-education", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 466},

In a significant step towards strengthening bilateral economic ties, Ashik Chowdhury, executive chairman of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA), met with Yeo Han-koo, trade minister of South Korea, in Seoul to discuss the roadmap for finalizing the proposed CEPA. The two leaders engaged in in-depth discussions on enhancing trade, investment, and institutional linkages between the two nations, said a press release on Thursday. ‘South Korea has long been a trusted partner of Bangladesh,’ said Ashik Chowdhury. ‘We are keen to accelerate CEPA finalisation, which we believe will be a catalytic tool to unlock diversified Korean investment in key sectors such as electronics, mobility, renewable energy, textiles, and infrastructure,’ he added. He also assured Minister Yeo that BIDA is actively addressing investor concerns. ‘During our visit, we engaged with Korean businesses on key enablers and structural bottlenecks,’ he said. ‘Many of the issues raised — particularly those related to customs, remittance, and taxation are already being tackled through our 32-Point Investment Climate Reform Agenda, developed in close collaboration with the Chief Adviser’s Office,’ he said. The South Korean Trade Minister, who in his earlier tenure as a World Bank official visited Bangladesh several times and remains an ardent supporter of the country’s development trajectory, welcomed the progress made. He reaffirmed Korea’s interest in partnering with Bangladesh as it transitions into a modern manufacturing and services hub. The BIDA delegation extended a formal invitation to Minister Yeo to visit Bangladesh with a Korean business delegation to witness first-hand the significant progress made in infrastructure, digital services, and regulatory reforms. With South Korean FDI stock reaching $1.56 billion across 150+ companies, South Korea is currently the 5th largest foreign investor in Bangladesh.

{"title": "Howe swerves Slot’s ‘smaller club’ jibe over Isak transfer", "body": "Newcastle manager Eddie Howe swerved a row with Arne Slot on Friday after his Liverpool counterpart referred to Newcastle as a ‘smaller club’ when discussing Alexander Isak’s transfer to Anfield. The Reds boss made the comments after the 26-year-old Sweden international, who joined Liverpool from Newcastle last month, limped out of Wednesday’s 5-1 Champions League win at Eintracht Frankfurt with a groin problem. Slot said Isak, who has one goal in eight appearances for his new club, was struggling because ‘you cannot compare maybe a player that hasn’t trained or played in pre-season at a smaller club than if you go to Liverpool’. Howe, speaking ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match against Fulham, refused to be drawn into a war of words with Slot. ‘I don’t have to do that, I don’t feel,’ he said. ‘But you obviously know what my answer would be.’ Howe, whose team beat Liverpool in last season’s League Cup final, added: ‘I don’t think that’s wise, for me to get involved in those discussions, I think. Alex is no longer at this football club, so I won’t comment on it.’ Slot’s remarks are open to interpretation but Howe strongly defended how his own club looks after their players. ‘The set-up here is very good. It is not perfect, we’ve got things to improve and to grow,’ he said. ‘But the owners here have developed the facilities since I’ve been here very, very well and you can see there is building work going on currently to hopefully deliver even better in the future.’ Howe said he was delighted with Isak’s replacement Nick Woltemade, who has scored five goals in all competitions for the club this season. The Germany international scored a goal on his debut against Wolves but was substituted in the second half after struggling with cramp. Howe said he had made a ‘vast improvement’ physically since his arrival and had impressed during Tuesday’s 3-0 victory against Benfica. ‘The challenge for him in this moment is that he’s got to do it every three or four days and that’s not easy physically and mentally so a lot of responsibility on his shoulders but he’s carrying that really well,’ he said. ‘I see a player and a person coming into the training ground who feels more at home in his environment now, a lot more relaxed. You are seeing his natural personality come out and it’s all positive.’ Newcastle are struggling in 14th place in the Premier League ahead of the Fulham game, with just two wins so far.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/280084/howe-swerves-slots-smaller-club-jibe-over-isak-transfer", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 423},
{"title": "Disasters disrupt education", "body": "Different natural and human-made disasters are adversely affecting the country’s education sector by lowering quality of education and damaging infrastructure of the educational institutions round the year, government data show. With the changes in intensity, frequency, duration and timing of the natural disasters in recent years due to climate change, students especially the girl ones are continuing to face challenges like dropout, early marriage, poor academic performance and trafficking. Researchers and academics said that the negative impacts on the education system were increasing due to a lack of inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination, the absence of pragmatic, actionable and implementable disaster management plans of the government and a huge gap in the implementation of policies. Changes in scheduling and management of schools and disaster management policies and increasing awareness and readiness among students and teachers have been suggested by them to reduce these harsh impacts. According to the Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024, between 2013 and 2024, due to cyclones, floods and tides, 32,013 primary- to tertiary-level government and non-government educational institutions were closed, 17,603 institutions were open but classes could not be held, 17,289 institutions saw trees around them dying, 17,289 institutions’ classrooms were damaged, 13,263 institutions’ playground became unusable, 7,436 institutions were used as shelters, 4,974 institutions saw curriculum not completed properly, 4,911 institutions’ toilet system were collapsed, 4,898 institutions’ water supply system were collapsed, 3,117 institutions’ connecting roads were completely damaged, 2,003 institutions’ hall rooms were damaged, and 178 institutions had to be relocated. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 has been published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics recently based on a countrywide survey. Professor emeritus Ainun Nishat, adviser for the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research at BRAC University, said that impacts of climate change were directly related to various natural disasters. ‘Intensity, frequency, duration and timing of each of the disasters are changing,’ he said, adding ‘and obviously these have impacts on the education system.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, founder of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, said that students especially the girl ones were severely affected by the natural and human-made disasters. During any prolonged closure of the educational institutions by disasters, girls faced different types of harassment due to lack of security, he said. ‘As per my evidence-based research, in border areas like at Domar (upazila), Nilphamari (district), Bhurungamari (an upazila in Rangpur district), Bhomra port (in Satkhira district) and in Jashore border girls were being trafficked due to poverty,’ Mokaddam said. He said that their parents were being assured that their girls would return once the schools would reopen. The parents also chose early marriages for their girls during disasters, he added. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 also showed that following different natural and human-made disasters, a total of 1,02,015 students, including 62,308, or 61.08 per cent, girl students, were dropped out in 2024. Out of the total dropouts, the highest 57,105 dropped out from the secondary level followed by 35,614 from colleges, 8,600 from madrasahs and 696 from the primary level. The preliminary findings of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2025 conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund recently, showed that the national rate of child marriage currently was 56 per cent. The BANBEIS’s 2024 report also showed that due to the impacts of disasters, the percentage of students having performance loss in different subjects, including Bangla, English, mathematics, science, sociology, accounting and religion was 1.11 per cent at the primary level, 77.72 per cent at the secondary level, 5.37 per cent at the college level and 15.8 per cent at the madrassahs in 2024. Meanwhile, the National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (2023‐2050), prepared by the environment, forest and climate change ministry for climate change adaptation, identified 14 disasters and 11 climate stress areas in Bangladesh. Referring to the disasters and climate stress areas, climate change specialist Ainun Nishat said that the authorities had to develop an understanding how these were impacting the education system. First, he said, there will be more intensified and prolonged heat waves but all classrooms cannot be made air-conditioned. He recalled that in the 50s, 60s and 70s, the primary school classes were held between 7:00am and 10:00am or 11:00am to avoid the hottest time of the day. The timing of the rainy season is changing also, which is closely connected with the crop planting and male students as they have to help their parents on fields, Ainun said. Cyclones usually happen in eight weeks from March 15 to May 15 or October 15 to December 15, he said. During the cyclones and floods, people take shelter in the educational institutions and nobody wants to leave the shelters quickly after the disasters, he said. ‘The intensities of disasters are changing and there has to be policy change regarding school hours,’ he said. Ainun said that the environment ministry was carrying out the national adaptation plan without coordinating with the education ministry. ‘Every ministry will be affected by disasters,’ he said, adding, ‘in our country inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination is very poor.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, who was a member of the NAP feasibility committee, said that during the cyclones and floods, educational institutions were not only damaged but also used as shelters, which caused dislocation and prolonged closure of these institutions. He mentioned that two years ago during a flash flood, 94 per cent of areas in Sunamganj and 90 per cent areas in Sylhet were gone under water for 40 to 45 days. ‘For the past four decades, these educational institutions remained in this fragile state and unfortunately we are not getting out of this situation,’ he said. The prolonged closure of these institutions also affected students physically and mentally, he said, adding that due to the discontinuity of education, many students dropped out in an increasing rate. Mokaddam said that there were some sort and immediate rehabilitation initiatives but no pragmatic, actionable and implementable short-, middle- and long-term plans for disaster management. About the existing plans, he said, ‘There is a huge gap in implementing these.’ He said that during the earthquakes in Dhaka in November, some of the traumatised Dhaka University students jumped from buildings and got injured. ‘There should be awareness and readiness among the students and teachers,’ he said. He termed fire incidents, road accidents, discrimination in education and waterlogging in urban areas human-made disasters. There are 1,50,007 primary- to tertiary-level educational institutions (primary schools, junior secondary schools, secondary schools, school section of the secondary school, colleges and madrassahs) in the country.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/284091/disasters-disrupt-education", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 1093},

Gazaria Upazila Health Complex emergency department physician Nure Alam Jiku, said ‘Joy was declared dead on arrival. There were several sharp-weapon injuries on his body.’ New Age correspondent in Noakhali reported that Sabbir’s friend Anwar Hossain Shakil said that due to a family dispute, Shamim, the younger brother-in-law of Monowara Begum of Char Gullyakhali village under Dhanshalik union, had secretly cut down her gourd vines five days ago. Shamim allegedly assaulted Monowara when she caught Shamim cutting the seedlings of her chili plants Wednesday afternoon. Later, Anwar and several others, including Sabbir, went to Monowara’s house in the evening and sent her to the hospital. As they were returning from Monowara’s house, Shamim approached them and, at one point, struck Sabbir on the head with a locally-made weapon. Local residents took Sabbir to Kabirhat Upazila Health Complex, from where he was referred to the 250-bed Noakhali General Hospital. From there, he was being taken to Dhaka for advanced treatment but died at about 3:00am on Thursday on his way to Dhaka. Kabirhat Police Station OC Md Shahin Mia said that the police arrested Abdur Sobhan Shamim, 30, son of Md Siraj, of Pan Bepari Bari in Dhanshalik union, and his wife, Farhana Akter, 23. Meanwhile, the schoolgirl Mohona’s uncle, Saiful Islam Tanim, said that she had sat for her Bangla second-paper examination Thursday morning, and at about 11:30am, the family was informed that she had died by suicide. He relatives were told that she had been caught cheating during the exam and had taken her own life out of humiliation, he added. Mostak Sarwar Rizvi, a teacher at Binodpur High School, said ‘After the exam, the student went to the toilet, where she wrapped her scarf around the toilet grille and took her own life,’ he said, adding that she was later taken to the 250-bed Noakhali General Hospital, where doctors declared her dead.

The Government of Bangladesh expresses its serious concern over this deplorable incident and calls upon the Government of India to conduct an immediate, impartial and transparent investigation into the incident and take sincere efforts to stop recurrence of such inhumane acts,’ said a press release issued by the foreign ministry in Dhaka. It said that the perpetrators must be identified and brought to justice. The Government of Bangladesh underscored that all individuals, irrespective of their nationality, were entitled to the full protection of their human rights, regardless of which side of the border they may inadvertently find themselves in, the release mentioned.

{"title": "RUCSU electioneering resumes as RU reopens after 14-day closure", "body": "Electioneering in the elections to the Rajshahi University Central Students’ Union, hall unions and Senate student representative posts resumed on Sunday as the university’s academic and administrative activities restarted following a 14-day suspension. The university reopened after two weeks of closure caused by student protests, a work abstention by teachers and employees over ward quota and holidays for Durga Puja, the largest religious festival of the Hindus in the country. The campus saw renewed activities on Sunday as students, teachers and officials returned and joined their regular duties. Despite intermittent rain, candidates from various panels began campaigning early in the day, distributing leaflets and engaging with students at key points, including the Transport Market, Tukitaki Chattar and academic buildings. Nafiul Islam Jibon, general secretary candidate from Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal-backed ‘Oikkoboddho Notun Projonmo’ panel, said that they had resumed their campaign with optimism. ‘After a long suspension, the campus is returning to normal. We are reaching out to students and seeing enthusiasm for a participatory election,’ he said. Mehedi Maruf, vice-president candidate from the ‘RUCSU for Radical Change’ panel, said that although students had returned to campus, many remained unsure whether the election would take place as scheduled for October 16. Fahim Reza, general secretary candidate from Islami Chhatra Shibir-backed ‘Sammilita Shikkharthi Jote’, said that the reinstatement of the ward quota for children of university staff and repeated deferrals of the RUCSU election had disrupted the electoral atmosphere and created confusion among students. ‘We urge the administration and the election commission to dispel those doubts,’ he said. Samsad Jahan, a women’s affairs candidate from the ‘Sarbojonin Chhatra Sangsad’ panel, said that the candidates were trying to revive the election spirit. ‘We want this election to be inclusive and reflective of all student voices,’ she said. Meanwhile, the RUCSU election commission revised the electioneering schedule for candidates. According to the new schedule, candidates will be able to carry out their campaigning until midnight on October 14. Earlier on September 18, the university authorities reinstated the ward quota, granting admission privileges to children of teachers, officers and employees under the ‘institutional facilities’ category. The move sparked immediate student protests. On September 20, students opposing the reinstatement scuffled with the teachers and staff, leaving several people injured. Amid protests, the authorities suspended admissions under the ward quota on September 21 and the syndicate later formed two probe committees to investigate the incident. That night, the Jatiyatabadi Shikkhak Forum announced an indefinite shutdown, demanding reinstatement of the ward quota and exemplary punishment for those allegedly involved in the assault of teachers and officials. On September 21, officials and employees joined the strike with teachers, paralysing all activities and forcing the RUCSU election commission to defer the long-awaited elections to the RUCSU, hall unions, and Senate student representative to October 16 from September 25. On January 2, the university, in the face of student protests, abolished the ward quota. In August, a section of teachers, officers and employees launched a movement demanding reinstatement of the facility, leading the authorities to restore it on September 18.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/education/278203/rucsu-electioneering-resumes-as-ru-reopens-after-14-day-closure", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 509},

Regional markets extended their upward rise after Wall Street saw US shares close at a high this week. Most markets across the world were shuttered Thursday for Christmas. Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul and Taipei all rose by closing time on Friday. Markets in Hong Kong, Australia and most of Europe were closed. Analysts have projected a ‘Santa Claus rally’ — the phenomenon where prices tend to rise during the last five days of December and the first two days of the new year.

{"title": "Rizwana calls for plastic-free campuses", "body": "Environment, forest and climate change adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan on Saturday urged the authorities of universities to ensure plastic-free campuses through student engagement, awareness campaigns, and access to sustainable alternatives. ‘A generation that moves away from excessive convenience, will not only reduce harmful plastic consumption but also help revive local industries like jute, strengthen the national economy and promote environmentally responsible production,’ she said. She made these remarks while speaking joining virtually from his residence at the Awareness Building and Dissemination Campaign on ‘Sustainable Plastic-Free Marine Environment’, organised under the Sustainable Capacity Building to Reduce Reversible Pollution by Plastics project by CUET at Radisson Blu Chattogram Bay View. She encouraged involving students, especially girls, in producing paper, jute, or cloth bags. Rizwana said that shifting from plastic to sustainable alternatives will require time, effort, and a fundamental change in consumer behaviour. She noted that the consumption pattern, developed over decades, cannot be reversed overnight. She added that achieving plastic-free campuses by eliminating single-use plastics and other avoidable plastic items will likewise require sustained institutional commitment. Commenting on the widespread use of single-use plastics, the environment adviser said that consumer dependence is driven largely by convenience and the misconception that such products come ‘free’. ‘In reality, plastic production incurs significant costs—including labour, electricity, imported machinery, and raw materials—and the hidden price is ultimately paid by the environment and ecosystems,’ she added. Rizwana Hasan commended the host institution for successfully implementing the four-year project and encouraged its planned extension. She emphasised that today’s educational interventions would shape tomorrow’s environmental outcomes and stressed the importance of teaching students about the sustainable lifestyles of earlier generations, as well as the economic and ecological benefits of moving away from single-use plastics. She noted that alternatives already exist for most single-use plastic items, except for some products like disposable pens, where fully sustainable substitutes are still evolving. Bangladesh is uniquely positioned with easy access to jute, cloth, and other local materials that can replace plastic in daily life. Rising student engagement on plastic alternatives is an encouraging sign of progress, she said. She warned that although recycling is often promoted as a solution, it is energy-intensive and chemically complex. Therefore, Bangladesh must focus on reducing plastic use, redesigning plastic products for easier recycling, and enforcing extended producer responsibility, she said. She pointed to global practices—such as mandatory payment for shopping bags, bottle deposit-return systems, and strict regulatory actions—that Bangladesh could adapt. She emphasised that the country must modernise its waste management system to address all forms of waste, with plastics requiring specific attention due to their non-biodegradable nature.

He was speaking at the inaugural session of ‘Ctrl+Alt+Story: Research and Storytelling in Journalism’ a DRIK-ULAB joint initiative to inspire and help prospective storytellers grow through active mentorship. The event was held on Thursday to welcome the participants and orient them with the four-month-long activities. Sumon Rahman, dean of ULAB’s School of Social Science and the head of Media Studies and Journalism Department, delivered the welcome address. He said that in our increasingly fast-paced world we are becoming more prone to shorter/quick things and reading/writing longer, in-depth pieces becoming rare which in the long-run may affect all aspects of our life as these habits are connected to deep and critical thinking and taking time for that. This initiative is to inspire our young minds to revive those habits and skills. He thanked DRIK to partner with ULAB in such an important and timely initiative. In his interactive session with the participants, Alam discussed the basics of (slow) investigative journalism by presenting several examples from his four decade-long career as well as from the others. He mentioned that journalism is not a clerical job of telling people who said what at where (at which event) or what happened here and there, but it is a creative arena of explaining the ‘why’ by digging deeper objectively and scientifically and telling that to people in a way they will understand the best. We must not just rush with everything, rather we need to slow down sometimes, think deeply and critically to understand the true essence of the phenomena around us – he stressed. Alam also warned the students that seeking out ‘why’ is neither easy nor safe often; same applies to sharing the answer with people. However, there will always be ways if your intent is honest and strong – he added. Sarkar Barbaq Quarmal, Associate Professor, Media Studies and Journalism, ULAB and one of the project coordinators, moderated the session while the other coordinator, Oliur Rahman Sun, Lecturer, Department of English and Humanities, ULAB presented the details of the initiative to the participants. It is noteworthy here that the Ctrl+Alt+Story initiative started with 21 participants selected through a two-step rigorous process. In next six weeks, they will participate in several workshops and master classes with renowned journalists and storytellers. Afterwards, ten students will be provided with a fellowship worth fifty thousand taka each and a mentor to pursue an investigative journalism project of their preference.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/286112/fellowship-launched-by-ulab-drik", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 429},
{"title": "US, Australia sign rare earths deal", "body": "US president Donald Trump signed a deal on rare earth minerals Monday with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, and said Washington’s key ally would get its coveted nuclear-powered attack submarines. The two leaders met at the White House to concentrate on a pair of areas — defence and critical minerals — in which Washington and Canberra are cooperating against what they view as an increasingly assertive China. Albanese said the rare earths deal would lead to $8.5 billion in critical minerals projects in Australia and take relations to the ‘next level.’ The Australian premier has touted his country’s abundant critical minerals as a way to loosen China’s grip over global supplies of rare earths, which are vital for tech products. Government figures show Australia is among the world’s top five producers of lithium, cobalt and manganese — used in everything from semiconductors to defence hardware, electric cars and wind turbines. China is easily the world’s largest refiner of lithium and nickel, and has a near monopoly on the processing of other rare earth elements. Analysts have said Australia is unlikely to challenge this dominance — but does offer a reliable, albeit smaller pipeline that lessens the risk of relying on China. The Australian government said it and the US government would each invest more than $1 billion over the next six months, while the White House put the figure at $3 billion between the two countries. Albanese had also been pushing for progress on the stalled 2021 AUKUS submarine deal between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Washington said earlier this year it was reviewing the deal for at least three Virginia-class nuclear attack subs signed under previous president Joe Biden, but Trump promised Australia would get them. ‘The submarines that we’re starting to build for Australia are really moving along,’ Trump told reporters as he sat alongside Albanese in the cabinet room of the White House. ‘We’ve worked on this long and hard, and we’re starting that process right now. And it’s really moving along very rapidly, very well.’ The AUKUS deal could cost Canberra up to US$235 billion over the next 30 years. It also includes the technology to build its own vessels in the future. Australia also had a major bust-up with France after it cancelled a multi-billion-dollar deal to buy a fleet of diesel-powered submarines from Paris and go with the AUKUS program instead. The nuclear-powered vessels lie at the heart of Australia’s strategy of improving its long-range strike capabilities in the Pacific, particularly against China. But the Trump administration said in June it had put AUKUS under review to ensure it aligned with his ‘America First agenda,’ saying it needed to ensure the United States had enough of the subs. Albanese meanwhile managed to ride out an awkward confrontation between Trump and Australia’s ambassador to Washington — former prime minister Kevin Rudd. Rudd deleted a series of critical social media posts about Trump following the Republican’s election victory last year. ‘I don’t like you either. I don’t. And I probably never will,’ Trump said to Rudd when a reporter pointed out that the ex-premier was in the room and asked the US president whether he minded the comments. Australians have a mostly unfavourable view of the Trump administration, polling shows, though the country relies on the United States to balance China’s expanding military clout in the Pacific region. China loomed large over both of the key issues in the talks. Australia has touted itself as a key US ally against China’s territorial assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region, from Taiwan to the South China Sea. On China, Australia announced plans for a strategic reserve of critical minerals to provide to ‘key partners’ such as Washington to help relax Beijing’s chokehold. Trump this month accused China of pressuring trade partners with new rare export curbs and threatened 100-per cent tariffs in response.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/279787/us-australia-sign-rare-earths-deal", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 647},

On Wednesday Dhaka’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy,’ referring to a health threat, according to the AQI index. Such air quality continued for the past few days. With the arrival of winter, the air quality is apparently worsening day by day in the capital. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301 and above is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. India’s Delhi, Pakistan’s Lahore and Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kinshasa cities respectively occupied the first, second and third spots on the list, with AQI scores of 277, 244, and 192 respectively. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.

{"title": "Modi, Trump discuss trade as India, US work to repair ties", "body": "Indian prime minister Narendra Modi revealed on Wednesday he had held a conversation with Donald Trump, with the US president saying the pair had discussed trade as the countries negotiate a deal that could mend strained ties. Relations plummeted in August when Trump raised tariffs on Indian exports to the United States to 50 percent and US officials accused India of financing Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. During a ceremony to mark Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, on Tuesday, Trump told reporters he had spoken by phone with Modi. ‘We talked about trade -- we talked about a lot of things, but mostly the world of trade,’ Trump said while lighting candles for the celebration at the White House. ‘He’s very interested in that.’ Modi thanked Trump for the call, saying on X that he hoped ‘our two great democracies continue to illuminate the world with hope.’ India has yet to secure a formal trade deal with the United States, despite being among the first nations to initiate negotiations with Washington after Trump began his second term. Trump also repeated his claim -- first made on October 15 -- that India would cut Russian oil purchases. New Delhi has neither confirmed nor denied any policy shift. India, one of the world’s largest crude oil importers, relies on foreign suppliers for more than 85 percent of its oil needs. Traditionally reliant on Middle Eastern producers, New Delhi started buying heavily discounted Russian crude in 2022, taking advantage of Western sanctions that limited Moscow’s export options. Several other sources of friction have strained Washington’s relationship with India this year. They include Trump’s assertions that he achieved a ceasefire between India and Pakistan to end an intense four-day conflict over the contested region of Kashmir in May. Modi has said there was no such mediation by a world leader. And last month, the Trump administration hiked fees for H-1B skilled-worker visas to $100,000. Indians make up roughly three-quarters of all H-1B recipients. Trump and Modi may yet meet this month at the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Malaysia, which Trump is set to attend. New Delhi has not confirmed whether Modi will participate, as India is not a member of the 10-nation bloc.

{"title": "18cr people’s fate shouldn’t be treated lightly: BNP", "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed on Saturday said that statecraft was not a child’s play and the fate of 18 crore people should not be treated lightly. The BNP would never bow to schemes of any political party, he went on to say. To those parties who are sacrificing the national interest and the people’s interest for their own narrow political aims and base motives, I will say return to the right path in the interest of the people of Bangladesh and do not mislead the public,’ he said. He indicated the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and some other parties who were demanding proportional representation in the forthcoming elections. He made the remarks while speaking at the 36th founding anniversary of the National Democratic Party at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka. The event was chaired by NDP chair Abdullah Al Harun. Salahuddin criticised calls for the PR system, describing it as a recipe for ‘permanent restlessness’ that would breed chronic instability. Citing examples of other countries, he predicted that the PR methods could lead to short-lived governments and an inability to implement policies, warning that Bangladesh must avoid a system in which simple majorities could not form a stable government. Recent public surveys, Salahuddin said, showed that 56 per cent of the people did not understand the proposed PR system and that it should not be imposed. He also accused the parties demanding proportional representation of trying to delay the next parliamentary elections for their own partisan advantage. Salahuddin further said that any delays in the elections could create opportunities for anti-democratic, even fascist, forces to re-emerge. Over the past 16 years, the BNP and the people of Bangladesh struggled to regain voting rights, which were essential for the country’s democratic journey, he said. He observed that by exercising these rights, the people would independently empower a future political government, and those elected to the Jatiya Sangsad would be accountable for implementing the reforms agreed under the National Consensus Commission. Salahuddin clarified that while some promises could be implemented immediately, certain constitutional provisions required the next parliament and the formal amendment process for full implementation. The BNP leader, in his address, condemned Israel’s obstruction of the humanitarian convoys to Gaza and urged the United Nations and the international community to assume a responsible role. He said that the Bangladesh government and people stand with the Palestinian population and appealed for urgent action from the international community in this regard.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/politics/278095/18cr-peoples-fate-shouldnt-be-treated-lightly-bnp", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 412},
{"title": "Barca hoping Camp Nou return can spark Liga title defence", "body": "Finally reopening Camp Nou is cause to celebrate for Barcelona but coach Hansi Flick will only be happy if they inaugurate their rebuilt stadium by kickstarting their La Liga title defence on Saturday. The Catalan giants host Athletic Bilbao while trailing Real Madrid by three points after an inconsistent start to the campaign, below the level they were as they claimed a domestic treble last season. With three international breaks disrupting the opening months, now Flick has the chance to knuckle down and find solutions to Barca’s problems. They have shipped 15 goals, more than nine of the 10 teams beneath them, while the attack has also struggled to ignite in the way it did in Flick’s debut year. Returning to their home is one of several reasons for Barca to believe the coming weeks will be positive. They last played at Camp Nou in May 2023, with the stadium shut for two-and-a-half years. Barca had hoped to reopen it in November 2024 but construction problems and other setbacks led to its delay, with the team playing in exile at the Olympic stadium. ‘(Playing there) will definitely help us... for the club’s future, it’s very important, I congratulate everyone who has worked on it,’ said Flick. In Barcelona’s prior outing they beat Celta Vigo 4-2 in Galicia, with a wild first half giving way to a far more controlled second, which might indicate the direction his team need to take. ‘The second half gives us confidence for the next matches and this is what we need,’ said the coach. Flick hopes that confidence is what the team needs to be able to execute their high-line defence to perfection, as they did for a long period last term. ‘I always think to say something about the experts, former players, former coaches, but I will not do it, (it makes) too much noise for us,’ said Flick, showing he has heard the criticism regularly aimed at him over Barca’s defensive woes. The club have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of the nine games they have played across all competitions since goalkeeper Joan Garcia was injured. The stopper is poised to return against Athletic to help end that run. Striker Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick against Celta and following a troubled start to the campaign because of injury his presence is a big boost. The veteran has a nose for goal which his stand-in Ferran Torres cannot replicate, as well as offering good build-up connections for Barca’s wingers. Teen starlet Lamine Yamal is a doubt after he missed Spain’s World Cup qualifiers following treatment on a long-running groin issue, while Raphinha is close to a return on the other flank. Although Marcus Rashford has impressed during his loan from Manchester United, the Brazilian’s intensity and work-rate has been missed in recent weeks. One problem for Flick against Athletic is Frenkie de Jong’s suspension while Pedri is out injured, denying the coach his first-choice pair of central midfielders. Marc Casado and Dani Olmo are likely to step in. Whoever Flick selects will become part of the stadium’s new history, 68 years after the previous iteration was opened in 1957.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/282831/barca-hoping-camp-nou-return-can-spark-liga-title-defence", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 528},
{"title": "Noor Ali, 13 others sued over Malaysia manpower export fraud", "body": "The Criminal Investigation Department filed a case against 14 individuals, including Noor Ali, owner of Unique Eastern (Pvt) Ltd, over allegations of a massive fraud in manpower exports to Malaysia, involving Tk 40.71 crore. The case was lodged under Sections 4(2) and 4(4) of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2012 with the Gulshan police on Sunday, according to a press release issued on Monday signed by CID special police super for media Jashim Uddin Khan. Investigations revealed that Noor Ali and his accomplices overcharged Bangladeshi workers seeking jobs abroad, the release said. While the government-set fee was Tk 78,990 per worker, the syndicate reportedly charged up to Tk 1.50 lakh, citing passport processing, medical checks, Covid-19 tests, and clothing expenses as victims said they were misled and pressured into paying the extra amounts. Between 2022 and 2024, the group sent 3,787 workers to Malaysia, systematically embezzling funds in the process. Preliminary evidence suggests that all the 14 accused were involved in a coordinated conspiracy, making the case a clear instance of money laundering under Bangladeshi law, according to the release. The CID’s Financial Crimes Division is now leading the investigation to recover embezzled funds and hold the syndicate accountable. The backdrop of the scam lies in Malaysia’s 2022 opening of its labour market to 15 source countries, including Bangladesh. Authorities projected 5,00,000 workers would migrate, and about 4,50,000 were sent by May 2024. The labour market, however, was abruptly closed to Bangladeshis after concerns were raised over corruption and irregularities in the recruitment process.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/277581/noor-ali-13-others-sued-over-malaysia-manpower-export-fraud", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 254},
{"title": "GAZA RECONSTRUCTION: Turkey rallies Muslim allies", "body": "Turkey on Monday hosts a string of top diplomats from the Islamic world to bring their influence to bear on the future of Gaza, as fears grow for the increasingly fragile truce. The October 10 ceasefire in the two-year-long Israel-Hamas war, brokered by US president Donald Trump, has been sorely tested by continued Israeli strikes and claims of Palestinian attacks on Israeli soldiers. In a bid to drive forward reconstruction efforts, Turkey’s foreign minister Hakan Fidan invited his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan and Indonesia to Istanbul for talks to start around 2:00pm (1100 GMT). All of them were called to a meeting with Trump in late September on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, just days before he unveiled his plan to end the fighting in Gaza. Turkish foreign ministry sources say Ankara will press them to support plans for Palestinians to take control of the coastal territory’s security and governance. At the weekend, Fidan welcomed a Hamas delegation led by Khalil al-Hayya, the Palestinian Islamist movement’s lead negotiator. ‘We must end the massacre in Gaza. A ceasefire in itself is not enough,’ Fidan said, stressing that ‘Gaza should be governed by the Palestinians.’ Earlier on Monday, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas appeared committed to the truce, pointing the finger of blame at Israel. ‘It seems Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement while Israel’s record is very poor,’ he told an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation gathering in Istanbul, saying Muslim states should play ‘a leading role’ in Gaza’s recovery. ‘We believe the reconstruction plan prepared by the Arab League and the OIC should be implemented immediately,’ he said of the plan unveiled in March. Turkey has been instrumental in backing Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the war in Gaza. Fidan is expected to repeat calls for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where aid agencies have complained their convoys still do not have enough access to alleviate the famine conditions in parts of the territory. Israel has long viewed Turkey’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and has expressed its firm opposition to Turkey having any role in the international peacekeeping force being put together to oversee the ceasefire. Under Trump’s plan, that stabilisation mission is meant to take over in the wake of the Israeli army’s withdrawal from the Palestinian territory. A Turkish disaster relief team, sent to help efforts to recover the many bodies buried under Gaza’s rubble — including those of Israeli hostages seized by Hamas—has likewise been stuck at the border because of the Israeli government’s refusal to let them in, according to Ankara. Meanwhile, Israel returned the bodies of 45 Palestinians to Gaza on Monday, bringing the total number handed over under the ceasefire deal to 270, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. Under a ceasefire deal brokered by Trump, Israel was to turn over the bodies of 15 Palestinians for every deceased Israeli returned. Following forensic identification, Israel confirmed Monday that remains handed over by Hamas the day before belonged to three hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 7, 2023 attack that sparked the war. The remains were those of American-Israeli Captain Omer Neutra, 21 years old at the time of his abduction, Corporal Oz Daniel, 19, and Colonel Assaf Hamami, 40, the highest-ranking officer killed by Hamas. Hamas’s armed wing said it had found the remains earlier on Sunday ‘along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip’. Hamas had been holding 48 hostages in Gaza when the truce came into effect on October 10, including 20 who were alive. Since the start of the truce, Hamas has released the 20 surviving hostages and begun handing over the remains of 28 deceased captives. Of the latter, it has so far returned 20 — including 18 Israelis, one Thai national and one Nepali. Israel has accused Hamas of dragging its feet in returning the bodies, while the Palestinian group says the process is slow because many remains are buried beneath Gaza’s rubble. It has repeatedly called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide it with the necessary equipment and personnel to recover the bodies.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/281079/gaza-reconstruction-turkey-rallies-muslim-allies", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 712},
{"title": "28 YEARS OF CHT ACCORD: Concerns expressed over delay in implementation", "body": "Rights activists, academics and professionals on Monday expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of the implementation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Accord signed back in 1997. They called on the interim government to take steps for the complete implementation of the treaty and remove discriminations among national minorities in the CHT comprising Rangamati, Khagrachhari and Bandarban districts, at a discussion in the capital Dhaka, marking the 28 years of the accord. The Parbatya Chattogram Chukti Bastabayan Andolan, a platform demanding execution of the treaty, organised the event at the National Press Club in the capital with Dhaka University sociology professor Khairul Islam Chowdhury in the chair. Khairul expressed concerns as the accord, popularly known as peace treaty, had not been implemented in past 28 years. Consequently, the ethnic minorities were being denied political empowerment and continued to be marginalised, he observed. Presenting the keynote speech, Parbatya Chattogram Chukti Bastabayan Andolan joint coordinator Zakir Hossain demanded the complete implementation of the peace treaty for establishing a peaceful atmosphere in the hill districts. Human rights are ignored and discriminations and repressions still continue in the Chattogram Hill Tracks, he added. He called on the interim government to resolve the land ownership in the CHT immediately. The CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission Act 2001 was amended in 2016 to recognise the customary rights of the region’s national minority communities and resolve land disputes in accordance with the law, customs and practices in force in the CHT. But over 22,000 land dispute applications from the national minorities have remained unresolved as corresponding rules under the law are yet to be formulated, according to the commission officials. Association for Land Reform and Development executive director Shamsul Huda said that the spirit of July uprising, which ousted Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League’s 15-year regime on August 5 2024, was to remove discriminations, but that was not implemented in the CHT. It was unfortunate that the interim government, which assumed office after the ouster of the AL regime, did not form any commission to resolve the crisis in the hills, he said. He demanded holding a national dialogue and preparing a road map to resolve the crisis in the hills. Parbatya Chattogram Chukti Bastabayan Andolan central leader Dipayon Khisha said that without establishing rights of the ethnic minorities, peace could not be established in the CHT. Abul Hasanat Abdullah, then chief whip of the Jatiya Sangsad and convener of the National Committee on CHT, and Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, better known as Santu Larma, who led the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, signed the accord respectively on behalf of the then AL-led government and the ‘residents of the CHT’ in the presence of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina on December 2, 1997. No fundamental change has occurred to the state of human rights in the CHT region in the past 11 months since Professor Muhammad Yunus-led interim government assumed power, according to a PCJSS half-yearly report published in July. As perpetrators of the 103 human rights violations affecting some 315 individuals belonging to the national minority communities from January-June, the report named security forces and law enforcement agencies deployed in the CHT, armed groups, communal and fundamentalist groups, Bengali settlers and land grabbers. Of the 103 incidents, 48 were carried out by security forces and law enforcement agencies, down from 73 such incidents perpetrated by the same actors as recorded during the same period past year.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/283915/28-years-of-cht-accord-concerns-expressed-over-delay-in-implementation", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 567},

{"title": "Survey shows dire state of children", "body": "Indicators of children’s condition in different areas such as education, health, and protection from violence and exploitation mostly worsened nationally from 2019 to this year, revealed the preliminary findings of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2025 on Sunday. The survey, conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, showed that the rates of child labour, child marriages, out-of-school number, violence against children, wasting, and underweight increased or remained significantly high over the 2019-2025 period. However, the rates of children with foundational reading and numeracy skills, net intake rate in primary education, and necessary dietary diversity for children declined or remained significantly low. Experts said that after the Covid-19 pandemic, children were the most adversely affected section of the population while the increase in poverty rate and the lack of implementation of policies and laws also resulted in such consequences. The survey findings also showed a rise in total fertility rate to 2.4 per cent in 2025 from 2.3 per cent in 2019 and the C-section rate to 51.8 per cent in 2025 from 36 per cent in 2019 and a decline in contraceptive prevalence rate to 58.2 per cent from 62.7 per cent in 2019 among the women aged 15-49. The MICS findings were released at a national dissemination event, organised jointly by the BBS and UNICEF, on Sunday at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in the capital. The survey was conducted on some 63,000 households between October 2024 and June this year in all the 64 districts. As per findings, child labour involved 9.2 per cent of the children aged between 5 and 17 years in 2025, which was 6.8 per cent in 2019, placing 12 lakh more children at risk. A total of 85.7 per cent of the children aged 1-14 experienced some kind of physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by adult household members in the past one month in 2025, which was 88.8 per cent in 2019. The national rate of child marriage has fallen from 60 per cent in 2019 to 56 per cent in 2025. Survey findings also revealed that 50.1 per cent of the children aged 7-14 could complete foundational reading tasks in 2025 in place of 48.8 per cent in 2019. Among the same age group, 39.2 per cent of the children could carry out foundational numeracy tasks in 2025 while the rate was 27.9 per cent in 2019, with the net intake rate in primary education declining to 59.8 per cent in 2025 from 61.4 per cent in 2019. The out-of-school rate went up among the primary school-age children to 6.7 per cent in 2025 from 6.4 per cent in 2019. The out-of-school rate also increased among the higher secondary school-age children over the survey period. For health, among the under-5 children, the rate of wasting climbed to 12.9 per cent from 9.8 per cent in 2019, underweight prevalence rose to 23 per cent from 22.6 per cent in 2019. Besides, the adolescent birth rate rose from 83 to 92 per 1,000 girls while only 35.2 per cent of children aged 6-23 months received the minimum dietary diversity -- necessary for healthy growth – in 2025, which was 33.8 per cent in 2019. ‘These findings were somewhat expected as after the corona pandemic we did not see necessary policy, investment or special efforts to recover the losses in education and health sectors not only during the previous political government but also during the present interim government ,’ said BRAC University professor emeritus Manzoor Ahmed. He also said that following the Russia-Ukraine war there was an economic impact while poverty in Bangladesh increased in recent years. ‘We suspected that all these factors had negative impact on children and now we have government data supporting our apprehension,’ the professor said, terming the findings as a ‘wakeup call’ for the government to take immediate remedial actions. Professor Shah Shamim Ahmed of the Institute of Education and Research at Dhaka University said that there were many policies and laws in Bangladesh for protecting children, which were not implemented. ‘Parents are being forced to send their children to work due to poverty,’ he said, adding that a gap emerged between the children and the institutions due to about a two-year closure of educational institutions during the pandemic. And for this gap all these problems emerged, the professor added. Meanwhile, sanitation access has improved to 73 per cent but safely managed water has fallen to 39.3 per cent with widespread bacterial contamination, according to the survey. The majority of household drinking water samples, over 80 per cent, tested positive for E.coli. Rana Flowers, the UNICEF representative to Bangladesh and the guest of honour at the dissemination event, said that the findings came at a critical time for Bangladesh and it is a reflection of both progress and ongoing challenges. Aleya Akter, secretary at the Statistics and Informatics Division and the special guest, said that this survey was not only very important but also very unique in nature. BBS director general Mohammed Mizanur Rahman said that this survey was introduced in 1993 and it was conducted this year for the seventh time.

The findings revealed that financial insecurity and inadequate benefits are silently eroding productivity, engagement, and overall well-being — posing a challenge for organizations striving to build resilient, high-performing workplaces, said a press release. The EBTS surveyed 571 employees and 142 employers across industries including RMG, banking, FMCG, telecom and NGOs. ‘Our research reveals a stark reality: financial stress and inadequate benefits are quietly undermining productivity and morale,’ said Ala Ahmad, chief executive officer of MetLife Bangladesh, at an event discussing the study. ‘Employers have a unique opportunity to lead by offering comprehensive benefits, fostering a caring culture, and improving communication. Doing so will not only strengthen trust but also unlock sustainable business performance,’ he said. ‘By prioritising care and trust, organisations can make benefits a powerful driver of productivity, loyalty and long-term growth,’ he added. The study found that over 56 per cent of employees admitted that financial worries reduced their productivity and 41 per cent linked financial stress to mental health issues, while 67 per cent felt confident of their current financial state. More than 53 per cent of employees reported that they had no retirement plan and nearly half wanted employer support to convert savings into income. Meanwhile, 72 per cent of employees believed that their organisation cared about them, yet gaps persisted in well-being and advocacy. Employers that demonstrate cared through benefits and culture could significantly boost engagement and retention, the EBTS showed. While 78 per cent of employees said that insurance and wellness benefits such as mental health support made them more loyal, there were large gap in offering these services. This disconnect created a trust deficit and by offering these benefits an opportunity for employers to differentiate. Seventy per cent of employees said that they would use benefits more if they knew how peers utilised them, highlighting the need for personalised, year-round communication strategies. Employers in Bangladesh are aware of the link between benefits and business performance, the release said. Nearly 56 per cent identify productivity and 49 per cent cite engagement as their biggest challenges, while 51 per cent have already increased investments in benefits over the past year to retain talent and boost morale. Furthermore, 78 per cent acknowledged that benefits played a critical role in shaping workplace culture, yet many admitted that current offerings were not effectively reducing stress or financial burden.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/mis/280574/metlife-study-finds-financial-wellness-key-to-productivity", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 412},

We are deeply sorry for the terror and violence you have endured. The nation has witnessed your courage and tolerance in the face of terror. Attacks on journalists are attacks on truth itself. We promise you full justice,’ it said. The interim government called upon every citizen to honour Sharif Osman Hadi, one of the organisers of the July mass uprising who died from bullet injures while undergoing treatment at a Singapore hospital on December 18 night, by rejecting and resisting violence, incitement and hatred at this critical hour. Gunshot-injured Osman Hadi, the convener of the Inquilab Mancha, breathed his last in Singapore at about 9:30pm on December 18 (Bangladesh time). Osman Hadi, who was very vocal against Indian hegemony and an aspiring independent candidate for the Dhaka-8 constituency in the forthcoming Jatiya Sangsad polls, was shot in the head on December 12 in the capital Dhaka. ‘This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition. We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace,’ the interim government’s statement said. The statement said that the parliamentary elections and referendum on February 12, 2026, were not merely political exercises. ‘They are a solemn national commitment. This promise is inseparable from the dream for which Shaheed Sharif Osman Hadi gave his life. Honouring his sacrifice and memory demands restraint, responsibility and abiding commitment to reject hatred,’ it said. ‘We wholeheartedly condemn lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh. There is no space for such violence in new Bangladesh. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will not be spared,’ it added.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/country/285635/govt-urges-citizens-to-resist-mob-violence", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 400},

{"title": "BAB chief calls for sustainable reforms", "body": "Reform initiatives and policy formulation in the banking sector should be sustainable, practical and gradual, said Abdul Hai Sarker, chairman of the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB). In an interview with New Age, the BAB chairman discussed the importance of coordination between the regulator and banks, the need for stakeholder involvement in policy design, and the implications of ongoing reforms in the sector. Abdul Hai, who is also chairman of Dhaka Bank, explained that policy formulation and implementation are complementary processes, and both must be aligned to achieve meaningful results. According to him, the best outcomes come when policymakers and those responsible for implementation — such as banks — work together with mutual understanding. ‘If the regulator does not discuss with us before making a policy, it becomes difficult for us to implement it. In some cases, the outcome can be worse instead of being better,’ he said. The BAB chairman, also chairman and CEO of Purbani Group, emphasised that Bangladesh Bank should consult with banks before introducing new directives to ensure the policies are realistic and compliant. He observed that the central bank has recently taken several reform initiatives simultaneously. While reforms are necessary, he believes they should be prioritised and introduced gradually to allow banks to adapt effectively. ‘Sometimes, the initiatives come all at once, which can make it hard for some banks to comply,’ he noted. Abdul Hai also pointed out that the taskforces formed by the Bangladesh Bank often include individuals not directly involved in the banking sector. He suggests that it is more productive to include bankers and bank owners who have firsthand experience. Commenting on the uneven condition of banks, the BAB chairman said that the same policy framework cannot be applied to all banks. With 62 banks in operation — several strong, some others struggling while the rest nearly collapsed — uniform directives often end up penalising well-performing banks. ‘Policies made for weaker banks affect the good ones too,’ he said. ‘Policies and directives should be made in a sustainable and compliant manner so that good banks are not discouraged.’ Abdul Hai was critical of the central bank’s approach to loan rescheduling, particularly for willful defaulters. He said that allowing rescheduling with just a 2 per cent down payment effectively rewards bad borrowers and undermines discipline. Decisions on rescheduling should depend on the relationship between the bank and the client, he said. On rising non-performing loans, Abdul Hai described the situation as ‘robbery in the banking sector’. He argued that the actual volume of bad loans would be far higher if rescheduled loans were included. Many defaulters never intended to repay; they took the money to embezzle, which has weakened the entire banking sector, he said. He also called for tighter control over the use of writ petitions, which defaulters often exploit to delay legal action. If a borrower cannot repay, there should be consequences — auction the mortgaged assets if needed, he said. He also criticised the legal loopholes that allow defaulters living abroad to secure stay orders or legal protection through representatives. At the same time, Abdul Hai urged regulators not to generalise wrongdoing in the sector. ‘Some directors might be involved in irregularities, but that doesn’t mean all are guilty,’ he said. He believes punishing wrongdoers is essential, but honest directors and responsible bankers should not be treated like them. Discussing the ongoing merger process of several banks, Abdul Hai said that the recovery of the merged bank could be difficult because new depositors may hesitate to keep their money, and existing ones may withdraw. He also pointed out the possibility of job losses following the merger as the overlapping positions would be eliminated. On governance issues, he questioned the effectiveness of mandatory independent directors, arguing that such directors may not have the same dedication like the bank owners who founded and nurtured their banks. Independent directors often lack the same level of commitment, he said, adding that while accountability is necessary, ownership should not be sidelined. The bank owners should be given priority, but those found guilty should face punishment, he added. Addressing irregularities in the sector, Abdul Hai said that eradicating corruption is difficult without a change in culture and mindset. He noted that even the best reforms fail if attitudes within banks remain unchanged.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/Banking/280566/bab-chief-calls-for-sustainable-reforms", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 717},
{"title": "Injured England quick Archer out of Ashes", "body": "England pace spearhead Jofra Archer was ruled out of the rest of the Ashes series Wednesday with a side strain while batsman Ollie Pope was axed for the fourth Test against Australia. Archer has arguably been England's best bowler over the first three Tests, sending down 80 overs and claiming nine wickets. He is replaced by Gus Atkinson, who leads the attack alongside Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse and skipper Ben Stokes, with Will Jacks retained as the spin option. It is a major setback for England who are 3-0 down in the series and desperate to restore pride at the Melbourne Cricket Ground starting Friday. They are already without quick Mark Wood who bowled just 11 overs for the tour before succumbing to a knee injury. The under-performing Pope paid for his poor form at number three, with Jacob Bethell taking over in the only other change. Opener Ben Duckett, who was purportedly shown drunk on an unverified video in between the second and third Tests, held his spot.

{"title": "France’s far-right leader hit by egg, days after flour attack", "body": "Jordan Bardella, leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, was hit on the head with an egg Saturday, just days after another incident in which a protester threw flour at him. Bardella was at an event in Moissac, southwest France, to promote his latest book when a man broke the egg on his head. The suspected attacker, a 74-year-old man, was arrested and taken into custody for violence against a public official, prosecutor Montauban Bruno Sauvage said. A complaint has been filed in Bardella’s name over the incident. On Tuesday, Bardella was covered in flour during a visit to an agricultural fair at Vesoul, in the east of the country. Police detained a 17-year-old teenage boy before releasing him the following day, and he will have to attend a course on citizenship. ‘The more we make progress, the closer we get to power, the more the violence from the far left, intolerance and pure stupidity are unleashed,’ Bardella posted on X late Saturday. ‘But a wind of freedom, national pride and patriotism is blowing across France, and they won’t be able to stop it,’ he continued, adding that he was fine. The National Rally senses its best-ever chance of winning power in the 2027 presidential vote, with Macron having served the maximum two terms. Its three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is barred from running after being convicted in a corruption case, but her 30-year-old lieutenant Bardella could be a candidate instead.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/283743/frances-far-right-leader-hit-by-egg-days-after-flour-attack", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 242},

{"title": "Month-long Jatra Utsab begins at BSA", "body": "Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy inaugurated a month-long Jatra Utsab to celebrate the Victory Day in December at its experimental theatre hall on Monday. The festival features 31 Jatra troupes’ performances across the country as part of implementation of Jatrashilpa Development Policy 2012, which distributes registration based on performance. According to the policy, after receiving a certificate from BSA, a jatra troupe can perform anywhere in Bangladesh. A notification on November 30 stated that the ministry of cultural affairs formed a 15-member Jatrashilpi Unnayan Committee including five members from different ministries led by the director general of the academy. The festival was inaugurated by cultural affairs secretary Md Mafidur Rahman while the drama and film department director Deepak Kumar Goswami delivered the welcome speech at the inauguration ceremony presided by director general of the academy Rezauddin Stalin. Deepak Kumar Goswami said that from the registered 205 troupes across the country only 55 are active while rest of the troupe stoppped their activities for many reasons. ‘Many troupes or their members are allegedly involved with obscenity and gambling during the pala and we need to set a guideline about these issues from the centre that the troupes are not to be involved with these activities,’ said Deepak. Md Mafidur Rahman said that jatra-pala is mostly watched by common people of the country which need more patrons. ‘We need to organise events round the year for common people to build an inclusive nation and society,’ Mafidur said, adding that the ministry is also focused on cultural events across the country. Mafidur also stressed on the publicities of the event so that common people would attend the jatra festival. The income generated from the ticket sold at the festival would be donated to the jatra troupes, as the ticket price was fixed at BDT 100 at the opening show which was watched by enthusiastic audiences. On the opening day, Khulna- based Jatra troupe Suryatarun Natya Sangstha staged Mrityuur Cokhe Jal which was written by Pranab Mondal and directed by Debendranath. Today, Narsingdi-based jatra troupe, New Jahura Opera, will stage Kashem Malar Prem, written by Shamsul Haque and directed by Mostafijur Rahman at the same venue.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/theatre/283903/month-long-jatra-utsab-begins-at-bsa", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 360},

{"title": "US circulates draft UN resolution for Trump’s Gaza plan", "body": "The United States on Wednesday presented a draft UN Security Council resolution to partner nations aimed at bolstering president Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, including by green-lighting an international security force, Washington’s mission said. US ambassador Mike Waltz shared the draft with the 10 elected members of the Security Council and several regional partners — Egypt, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey — a spokesperson for the US mission said in a statement. No date has been set to vote on the draft. The US statement said the resolution ‘welcomes the Board of Peace,’ a transitional governing body for Gaza envisioned in Trump’s 20-point plan, which he would chair. It also ‘authorises the International Stabilisation Force’ outlined in the peace plan. According to diplomatic sources, several countries have indicated their willingness to participate in the ISF, but insist on a Security Council mandate before actually deploying troops into the Palestinian territory. ‘Under president Trump’s bold leadership, the United States will again deliver results at the UN — not endless talk,’ the US spokesperson said. The creation of the international force was one part of the agreement that led to the fragile October 10 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, following two years of devastating violence triggered by the October 7 attack. Under the terms of the deal, troops would be drawn from mostly Arab and Muslim countries and deployed to Gaza to oversee security as the Israeli army withdraws. ‘The parties have seized this historic opportunity to finally end decades of bloodshed and make the president’s vision of lasting peace in the Middle East a reality,’ the US spokesperson added. Subsequent phases of Trump’s plan include further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the decimated territory.", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/281398/us-circulates-draft-un-resolution-for-trumps-gaza-plan", "date": "2025-12-27", "language": "en", "source": "New Age BD", "token_count": 290}
