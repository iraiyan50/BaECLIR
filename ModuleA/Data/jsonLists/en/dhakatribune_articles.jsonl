The document is divided into eight sections, with the first titled “A Discrimination-Free, Strong and Humane Bangladesh in the Spirit of the July Movement.” Its opening page features photographs of July movement martyrs Abu Sayeed, Sharif Osman bin Hadi, and BUET student Abrar Fahad, symbolizing resistance against injustice and authoritarianism.\n\n26 priority areas for governance\n\nThe manifesto begins with a pledge to establish a Bangladesh uncompromising on national interest, governed on the principles of justice (insaf) and human dignity. Key governance commitments include:\n\nThe party also promised a cohesive democratic system, accountability for extrajudicial killings, and protection of fundamental human rights. It vowed to prevent the return of what it termed “fascist governance” and promote service-oriented politics rather than confrontation. Equal citizenship rights for all, irrespective of religion, ethnicity, or social status, were emphasized.\n\nEconomy, investment, and employment\n\nThe manifesto outlines plans for a sustainable, transparent, and business-friendly economy. Jamaat-e-Islami pledged to stabilize commodity prices, create an investor-friendly environment, and generate large-scale employment through merit-based recruitment. Industrial expansion through SMEs, improving workers’ wages, safeguarding labor rights, and supporting expatriates’ welfare were also highlighted.\n\nAgriculture, food security, and environment\n\nAgricultural reform is a cornerstone, with plans for an “agricultural revolution” to increase productivity, ensure fair prices for farmers, and guarantee adulteration-free food. The party also committed to the “Three-Zero Vision”—zero environmental degradation, zero waste, and zero flood risk—alongside sustainable water management and climate resilience measures.\n\nYouth empowerment and entrepreneurship\n\nYouth empowerment is one of the most detailed policy areas. Jamaat-e-Islami aims to create 1.5 million freelancers and 500,000 new entrepreneurs within five years through e-work hubs and youth tech labs in every upazila, offering international-standard training and access to global freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr.\n\nThe manifesto proposes training 10 million youths in AI, IoT, cloud computing, cybersecurity, green technology, and entrepreneurship. Under the slogan “Entrepreneur first, not job first,” the party plans incubation centers in divisional cities and district-based youth job banks.\n\nEmployment support and financial assistance\n\nThe manifesto promises employment for 5 million youths within five years. Educated unemployed individuals would receive Tk10,000 per month for up to two years as an interest-free loan under a “skills diversification allowance.” Merit-based recruitment will be ensured in government jobs, with no age barriers for qualified candidates. Special funds will support women, marginalized communities, and ethnic minority entrepreneurs, while rural youth will be connected to global markets via high-speed internet and co-working spaces.\n\nEducation, healthcare, and social security\n\nJamaat-e-Islami pledged reforms in education, gradually introducing free education aligned with global standards. The manifesto promises modern, universal healthcare and a universal social security system. Affordable housing for low- and middle-income families and expanded social welfare programs were also highlighted.\n\nTransport, infrastructure, and urban development\n\nThe party plans to overhaul the national transport system, reduce travel time between Dhaka and divisional cities to two-three hours, improve urban planning, and enhance public transport safety and efficiency.\n\nSports and physical development\n\nThe manifesto aims to turn sports into a nationwide social movement. Targets include producing 500 international-standard athletes within five years through merit-based selection, stipends, science-based training, international exposure, and a Sports Science Institute. Traditional sports such as kabaddi, wrestling, and boat racing will be preserved and promoted.\n\nPublic participation in manifesto\n\nJamaat-e-Islami said the manifesto reflects over 3.7 million public opinions collected through app-based outreach, ensuring the document addresses citizens’ expectations and the country’s future needs.\n\nWith the national election approaching, the People’s Manifesto presents a detailed policy roadmap emphasizing governance reform, economic self-reliance, youth empowerment, social justice, accountability, inclusivity, and welfare-state principles.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "bangladesh/politics", "tokens": 720, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:29:32.078556"}

Several participants became emotional while describing their experiences.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Zaima Rahman said that ensuring facilities for persons with disabilities should not be viewed as catering to a specific group alone, but rather as creating equal and convenient access for society as a whole.\n\n\"The abilities and achievements you have demonstrated despite various limitations and hardships are a source of pride for the country,\" she said. \"We want you to come forward, take leadership roles, and work together with everyone.\"\n\nShe further expressed hope that with proper opportunities to nurture their talents, persons with disabilities could make significant contributions to different sectors of society and the state.\n\nParticipants at the discussion said that persons with disabilities are often not treated as equals in society. They noted that many educational institutions fail to accommodate students with disabilities, while several government training centers either do not provide proper training, have shut down, or subject trainees to harassment.\n\n\"We do not want to be a burden on society or live on anyone's mercy,\" they said. \"We want to prove ourselves through our qualifications, but we are not getting the opportunities to do so.

You did not even acknowledge those brutalities as crimes. Instead, you supported them and provided patronage,” he said.\n\nSpeaking at a milad and doa mahfil organised by BNP at its Nayapaltan central office on the occasion of Shab-e-Barat, Rizvi questioned Jamaat’s motive behind speaking about the declaration of independence.\n\nReferring to remarks by Jamaat-e-Islami Amir Dr Shafiqur Rahman on the 1971 declaration of independence in Chittagong, he said: “In a few days, you may even say that Ghulam Azam himself was the proclaimer of independence. You can say that too, because you never step back from telling lies.”\n\nThe BNP leader alleged that the Jamaat chief raised the debate on the declaration of independence to divert attention from his controversial and derogatory remarks about women, which have angered women across the country.\n\nEarlier on Monday night, while addressing an election rally at Bandar School Ground in Chittagong, Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Dr Shafiqur Rahman said the declaration of independence in 1971 was made from Chittagong.\n\n“Chittagong is not only a port city or a commercial capital; it is a city with a long history of struggle and resistance. The declaration of independence in 1971 took place here. One of your proud sons first shouted ‘We revolt’—he is Dr Colonel Oli Ahmed Bir Bikram, the respected president of the LDP. He held Ziaur Rahman’s hand and led him forward. Chattogram residents salute you. You were the ones who initiated this proud history,” he added.\n\nReacting to the Jamaat chief’s remarks, Rizvi said the party cannot hide the truth by creating controversy over an established historical fact.\n\nThe BNP leader also recalled Jamaat’s political role during the 1986 election under military ruler HM Ershad, accusing the party of breaking its promise not to take part in the polls.\n\n“Begum Khaleda Zia did not join that election. She endured years of repression, arrests and house arrest, but never broke her word,” he said, adding that Jamaat’s “true character” is now being exposed through its statements about women.\n\nRizvi asserted that former president Ziaur Rahman was the real proclaimer of Bangladesh’s independence.\n\n“As a major, Ziaur Rahman declared independence and gave direction to the nation, calling people to join the Liberation War. Even those who worked alongside Zia acknowledged his role in their own writings,” he said.\n\nThe BNP leader questioned whether people would accept such sudden political claims made for vested interests.\n\nHe said Oli Ahmed never described himself as the proclaimer of independence at any point in his military or professional life.\n\nRizvi said that even when Ziaur Rahman formed his party, Oli worked only as his assistant, and that these facts are clearly mentioned in his published books.\n\nHighlighting the significance of Shab-e-Barat, he said the holy night inspires self-purification and closeness to Allah, warning that social decay increases when people drift away from moral and spiritual values.\n\nThe BNP leader also accused some quarters of exploiting religion for political and commercial gains, saying Islam is not a commodity but a way of life for the country’s Muslims.\n\nSpeaking on women’s dignity, Rizvi said Islam grants women the highest respect, but recent vulgar and offensive remarks on social media have caused nationwide outrage.\n\n“This anger cannot be suppressed by raising false debates over the declaration of independence,” he said.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "bangladesh/politics", "tokens": 599, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:30:01.324838"}

Although he initially believed the post to be a government job, he later learned that UCCA Limited is a privately managed institution under BRDB, where employee salaries are paid from organizational income.\n\nShaheen Alam received regular salary payments until 2017. Since then, he has been paid for only five to six months per year, leaving the remaining months unpaid. According to official records, his salary arrears have now accumulated to 50 months. Discussions on bringing UCCA employees’ salaries under the government revenue budget have been ongoing for several years, but no effective measures have been implemented.\n\nAs a result, Shaheen Alam and his family are struggling to meet basic needs. Other employees at Sariakandi UCCA office include Inspector Aminul Islam, Accountant Kamrun Nahar Keya, Office Assistants Abdul Momin and Sohel Rana, Night Guard Badiuzzaman, and Cleaner Sakina Begum. Their families are also enduring similar conditions.\n\nIt was learned that this crisis is not limited to Sariakandi. UCCA employees working in different parts of the country are facing the same prolonged salary arrears, leaving many families in distress.\n\n“I completed my master’s degree and joined what I believed was a government job,” Shaheen Alam said. “For nearly half the year, my family survives without salary. I cannot properly support my children’s education or meet household expenses. Yet I work regular office hours and carry out field visits like government employees. We appeal to the government to include us under the revenue budget.”\n\nHM Hasan Al Mamun Nayan, President of the Bangladesh National Rural Development Cooperative Federation, said village-level farmers’ cooperatives were established in 1972 to promote rural development. He said these cooperatives initially performed well but later suffered due to lack of funding, training, and effective planning, rendering many of them nearly inactive nationwide.\n\nHe emphasized that participatory development is essential for sustainable rural growth and said revitalizing cooperatives is necessary to ensure fair prices for farmers, stabilize markets, and reduce the role of middlemen. “If these cooperatives are revived, employees will also receive their due salaries,” he added, expressing hope that the next government would address the issue.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "bangladesh/nation", "tokens": 437, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:30:24.328034"}

Farmers are now preparing to harvest the additional crop from fallow lands during the off-season.\n\nFavourable weather conditions have resulted in good yield, and news of attractive market prices has brought smiles to farmers’ faces.\n\nAccording to local sources, farmers in several areas of Sariakandi upazila cultivate paddy only during two seasons—Boro and Aman. During the three-month gap between these two seasons, large tracts of arable land usually remain fallow.\n\nFor the past few years, however, farmers have been cultivating mustard on these lands instead of leaving them unused. As a result, they are gaining an additional harvest and making considerable profits.\n\nMost farmers are cultivating mustard without ploughing the land, which significantly reduces production costs. Some farmers prepare the land with one or two light ploughings.\n\nMustard plants sown a few days ago have now grown well and are bearing pods with healthy grains. The crop is expected to mature within a few days. Farmers will soon begin harvesting and threshing the ripe mustard, entering a busy period.\n\nCurrently, mustard is selling in the market at prices ranging from Tk 3,800 to Tk 4,000 per maund, which has further encouraged the farmers.\n\nFarmer Jullu Mia (55) from Tior Para village of Narchi Union in Sariakandi said that last year he cultivated mustard on three bighas of land and harvested 18 maunds, earning a good profit due to fair prices.\n\n“This year, I have cultivated mustard on four bighas of land. By the grace of Allah, the yield has been very good. The crop has started to mature, and I will begin harvesting within a few days,” he added.\n\nAccording to the Sariakandi Upazila Agriculture Office, mustard was cultivated on 3,250 hectares of land in the upazila last year.\n\nThis year, the cultivation target was set at 3,500 hectares, against which mustard has been grown on 3,350 hectares.\n\nLast year, the average yield was 1.6 metric tons per hectare. Mustard can generally be harvested within 80 to 85 days of sowing.\n\nSariakandi Upazila Agriculture Officer Mohammad Ali Jinnah said that farmers have been benefiting from zero-tillage mustard cultivation for the past several years by following advice from the agriculture office.\n\n“Mustard provides both oil and oilcake, while the dried plants are used as fuel. These by-products are useful for human consumption, livestock feed, and various other purposes,” he said.\n\nHe further added that large-scale mustard cultivation would help reduce dependency on soybean oil.

In this context, senior NBR sources say that appointments and related activities are unlikely to progress under the current government.\n\nThe government had issued the “Revenue Policy and Revenue Management Ordinance, 2025” on May 12, 2025, to split the NBR.\n\nThe motive was that separating policy formulation from revenue collection and implementation would enhance efficiency, accountability, and transparency in tax administration.\n\nHowever, the ordinance triggered strong backlash from tax, VAT, and customs cadre officials within the NBR, who alleged that it was issued without consultation, ignored internal stakeholders, and aimed to establish dominance of non-revenue cadres in policymaking positions.\n\nProtests and work stoppages followed at NBR headquarters and tax and customs offices nationwide.\n\nAs a result, tax offices, VAT commissionerates, and customs houses were partially or fully closed for several days, directly affecting revenue collection.\n\nThe tax-to-GDP ratio fell to 6.6% in the current fiscal year, down from 7.4% the previous year, dealing a significant blow to the government.\n\nThe government responded with a hardline stance. Four senior tax, VAT, and customs officials—known for their integrity—were sent into compulsory retirement, including one commissioner.\n\nAround 35 officials were dismissed or temporarily suspended for alleged involvement in the movement, and several were placed under investigation by the Anti-Corruption Commission, intensifying fear and resentment within the administration.\n\nTo defuse tensions, the government formed a five-member advisory committee and later amended and reissued the ordinance in September 2025.\n\nThe amendment promised dominance of revenue cadres in the Revenue Management Division and inclusion of experts in economics, commerce, and tax policy in the Policy Division. Still, a large section of the NBR believes the core structural problems remain unresolved.\n\nLegal experts later argued that the ordinance conflicts with Article 55(6) of the Constitution, that departments cannot retain implementation authority under the Rules of Business, 1996, and that without amending multiple regulations—including the Cadre Composition Rules, 1980—the split cannot be enforced. Consequently, the process became entangled in legal complexities.\n\nAlthough the National Implementation Committee (NIKAR) recently gave policy-level approval to draft amendments to the Rules of Business and Allocation of Business, final clearance from the Secretaries Committee on Administrative Development remains pending. Repeated cancellation of meetings has made it clear that completing the split within the interim government’s tenure will be difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has begun reconsidering and reducing penalties for some officials involved in the protests.\n\nAn Internal Resources Division notification reinstated additional tax commissioner Sehela Siddika, though her promotion was frozen for a year and her pay grade reduced by two levels. Similar relief is being processed for about 25 officials. However, no reconsideration has been offered to the five senior officials forced into compulsory retirement.\n\nTransparency International Bangladesh Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said the turmoil surrounding the NBR split is unprecedented in global revenue administrations.\n\nHe criticized the ad hoc approach, undertaken without due process or involvement of core revenue collectors. While supporting the idea of separating revenue policy from administration, he stressed that the policy division must be an independent structure free from bureaucratic control and argued that the issue should be left to the next elected government.\n\nFormer NBR chairman Abdul Mazid believes the current structure is largely functional and that minor inconsistencies can be corrected later, while economist Dr Masrur Riaz also said it would be prudent to leave the decision to an elected government.\n\nDespite these developments, Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed has expressed optimism that the process could be completed by February 12.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on January 7 after a meeting of the government procurement advisory committee, he said that most formalities were nearly complete and that the reform would be implemented during the interim government’s tenure, even if deadlines slipped.\n\nHowever, an NBR member, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dhaka Tribune that implementing such a major administrative reform without the cooperation of the administration cadre is extremely difficult, and their reluctance has significantly reduced the prospects.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "business", "tokens": 969, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:31:05.759103"}

Currently, there are nearly 17,000 benchmark rates under the domestic supplementary duty structure, which is not conducive to investment and trade expansion. Revenue performance from small and medium-income individuals and enterprises remains unsatisfactory, largely due to irrational rate structures. However, determining tax rates involves numerous challenges across personal, corporate, and other forms of taxation.”\n\nMashiur Rahman remarked: “Institutions such as the World Health Organization, the Ministry of Health, and the Department of Environment should be included in consultations on supplementary duty determination.”\n\nHe further stressed the importance of adopting a business-friendly tax policy to sustain and promote enterprises that contribute to economic growth.\n\nBazlul Haque Khondker, research director at PRI, highlighted that despite steady growth in per capita GDP, Bangladesh’s tax-to-GDP ratio has been declining, contrary to the experience of comparable countries.\n\n“Around 17% of GDP currently comes from excise duties, which is outdated by modern standards. Corporate tax and VAT rates in Bangladesh are relatively high. Moreover, while most countries apply excise duties based on quantity, Bangladesh primarily imposes them on price,” Khondker noted.\n\nHe added that further in-depth analysis would be undertaken in the next phase of the research to recommend a more effective and contemporary excise duty structure.\n\nHafiz Choudhury, principal, The M Group, Inc, who joined virtually, questioned whether the current NBR framework is capable of ensuring fair and rational excise duty assessment.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, PRI chairman Zaidi Sattar said: “Conflicting demands in the 2012 tax law resulted in a complex and outdated tax policy introduced in 2019.

The next government will not face major difficulties in continuing from here. The situation is stable now — not shaky like before,” he said.\n\nDr Salehuddin, however, acknowledged that significant challenges remain ahead.\n\nThe finance adviser was responding to the queries of reporters after chairing the 5th meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase held on Wednesday at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat.\n\nHe said the economy is no longer in a fragile or unstable condition, unlike previous periods, and that the foundations have been stabilized to allow future governments to move forward.\n\nWhen asked whether the government had taken on record levels of debt, the finance adviser said that while borrowings had increased, a substantial amount of external debt had also been repaid.\n\n“Yes, borrowing increased, but we also repaid around six billion dollars in external debt. Debt repayment is equally important,” he said, adding that many large, expensive infrastructure projects were deliberately avoided.\n\n“We didn’t go for costly mega projects like tunnels or projects worth thousands of crores through loans. That is why public debt pressure didn’t worsen further,” he said.\n\nHe admitted that employment generation remained one of the government’s biggest challenges, largely because job creation requires sustained support for small and medium industries.\n\n“Our major challenge was employment generation. For that, small and medium enterprises are essential. But we didn’t have enough fiscal space. Large factories are not labour-intensive, and they come with many complexities,” he explained.\n\nAddressing concerns over contradictory statements about future economic risks, Dr Salehuddin clarified that while the economy is stable, reforms need to be consolidated and carried forward carefully.\n\n“What we have done is not a one-off solution. To take it forward, it needs to be strengthened further. That itself is a big challenge,” he said, noting that access to concessional foreign aid has declined.\n\nHe stressed that reforms require time, cooperation and procedural discipline, which are often difficult in Bangladesh’s complex administrative system.\n\n“Reform is not just about speeches. It requires process, cooperation and patience. Inside the system, procedures are extremely complicated. Without cooperation, it becomes very difficult,” he said.\n\nHighlighting governance reforms, Dr Salehuddin Ahmed said the government has made significant progress in digitising land records and khatian maps, making services cheaper and more accessible to citizens.\n\n“Porcha and land records are being digitized. Now people can get services for Tk20, which earlier cost Tk500. We are expanding digital access nationwide,” he said.\n\nHe described the initiative as one of the most fundamental service delivery reforms, reducing harassment and improving transparency.\n\nDr Salehuddin also confirmed that the government is preparing to face international arbitration over alleged financial disputes and money laundering allegations involving business interests linked to S Alam Group.\n\nHe said a case has been filed at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a World Bank-affiliated arbitration body, following complaints lodged by the concerned party.\n\n“They have gone for arbitration at the World Bank forum. We’ve received notice and must respond. This is a very serious matter involving a large amount of money,” he said.\n\nThe government has decided to engage international legal counsel to contest the case, he added.\n\n“We will engage a legal firm. This is not a simple issue. Legal preparation is essential,” he said, though he declined to disclose the name of the firm at this stage.\n\nA government team is expected to visit Washington, DC, to deal with the arbitration process, he said.\n\nOn power sector reforms, the finance adviser said electricity tariffs are being rationalized rather than increased arbitrarily.\n\n“This is tariff restructuring, not a price hike. Money is being adjusted from one segment to another. It will not affect electricity supply,” he said, adding that efficiency issues at power plants such as Ashuganj are also under review.\n\nDr Salehuddin said, despite criticism, many fundamental reforms had been undertaken, even if they were not always visible.\n\n“People say nothing has been done because they only look for visible projects. But many fundamental procedural reforms have taken place.

What really happened?First, the cost of feed rose sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine. The prices of imported feed ingredients increased. This supply shock was beyond the control of the poultry industry, and also beyond the control of the government.\n\nSecond, the Taka depreciated significantly against the US dollar, falling from around Tk86 to about Tk120. This depreciation was largely driven by the previous government's irresponsible economic policies.\n\nEconomists expect inflation whenever money supply increases too fast. Money supply is the sum of cash in circulation and bank deposits. Bangladesh Bank statistics show that money supply grew rapidly during the tenure of the last government. The most widely used measure of money supply, M2 or “broad money”, increased from Tk13.7 lakh crore in June 2020 to Tk18.9 lakh crore in June 2023. In just three years, money supply grew by roughly Tk5.2 lakh crore. That is enough money to pay for 16 Padma bridges.\n\nMoney supply grew rapidly because of two policy choices. First, banks were compelled to lend at artificially low interest rates. Second, the previous government maintained a large fiscal deficit, with expenditure far exceeding tax collection. Economists agree that the combination of low interest rates and sustained fiscal deficits fuels money supply growth and inflation. Such policies are colloquially referred to as to \"printing money\".\n\nThe previous government did not want to admit that it had caused inflation by printing money. It blamed imaginary \"syndicates\" (cartels) for inflation. The Competition Commission accused several poultry companies of manipulating the prices of eggs and chicken.  These allegations were baseless; the government was simply looking for a scapegoat.\n\nThe structure of the poultry industry makes it impossible for any cartel to control the markets for chicken and eggs. Thousands of farmers sell eggs and chicken every day. Any market with thousands of sellers is competitive.  Any seller who asks for a higher price than other sellers in his neighbourhood  will have difficulty selling his product. In competitive markets, prices fluctuate in response to supply and demand. It is not possible for thousands of sellers to agree to sell at a high price.\n\nEgg prices typically fall in winter, when consumers eat more winter vegetables, reducing the demand for eggs. Egg prices tend to rise in summer, when hens naturally lay fewer eggs, reducing supply. Volatility is a normal feature of agricultural production. In 2025, egg prices were low in March, June, July, November and December. Egg producers made losses for most of 2025 (and are still making losses). If the price were controlled by a cartel, why would the cartel allow such a low price? Obviously there is no cartel.\n\nThe Competition Commission should have hired an economist to study the poultry industry before jumping to the conclusion that price increases were caused by manipulation. Price increases alone do not constitute evidence of price manipulation.\n\nThe right economic policies can prevent further inflation.  Interest rates (bank lending rates) must be high whenever the government maintains a large fiscal deficit. The combination of low interest rates and a large fiscal deficit will always cause inflation. The Interim Government (to its credit) halted the depreciation of the Taka by raising interest rates. Bangladesh desperately needs an independent central bank, which must be tasked with controlling inflation and auditing banks (to prevent further fraudulent lending to those in power).\n\nOne hopes that future governments will not try to blame private companies for inflation. Inflation is never the fault of private companies; it is always the result of irresponsible macroeconomic policy.\n\nThe author is a director of Kazi Farms Limited", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "business", "tokens": 610, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:31:32.321698"}

As a result, although they are capable of disbursing loans, they are not getting the desired success in collection. In this situation, the flow of loans had to be kept narrow in the past.\n\nHowever, he noted that the flow of loans to government banks was limited even before 2000, which is by no means a sustainable model.\n\nAhsan H Mansur said: “If a bank cannot make an effective contribution to the larger economy by collecting deposits, then that achievement becomes limited. Sonali Bank is currently distributing loans cautiously, but now it is time to expand its lending activities more boldly.”\n\nHe also said that although consumer lending and house lending are important sectors internationally, the country's government banks are not able to play a significant role in this regard.

He hoped that Sonali Bank will also be able to pay dividends in the future.\n\nThe governor further said that the government will give Sonali Bank the freedom to operate in a truly commercial manner and he hopes that the next government will continue this trend. At the same time, he called on Sonali Bank to take more effective initiatives to increase remittance flow.\n\nExpressing optimism about the non-performing loan (NPL) situation, Ahsan H Mansur said that Sonali Bank's non-performing loan rate has already decreased from 18% and it is expected to decrease further.\n\nHowever, for this, it is necessary to increase the amount of loan disbursement.\n\nFinally, he said that caution should be maintained in providing loans and capable entrepreneurs and good SME customers at the field level should be identified.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "business", "tokens": 453, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:31:34.445995"}

At this point, the question can no longer be avoided: how much of its biggest promise—banking sector reform—was actually delivered?\n\nFollowing the mass uprising of July 2024, the interim government announced a reform agenda that placed the banking sector at its core.\n\nRestructuring a sector burdened by non-performing loans, political influence, and concentrated ownership was presented as a prerequisite for economic stability. Yet, more than a year and a half later, the main pillars of structural reform have yet to see the light of day.\n\nBig promises, limited implementation\n\nThe government’s reform roadmap identified two laws as the backbone of banking reform:\n\nIn reality, both laws remain pending approval as the government’s term draws to a close. The reform process has stalled precisely where it was supposed to begin.\n\nSo far, the interim government has issued only two ordinances related to the banking sector: the Bank Resolution Ordinance, and the Deposit Insurance Ordinance.\n\nAccording to Bangladesh Bank and economists, these are tools for crisis management, not reform.\n\nThey address how to handle a bank failure and provide partial protection to depositors, but they leave unanswered the fundamental questions: why banks become weak, who is responsible, and where authority and accountability should be limited.\n\nOfficials of Bangladesh Bank privately and publicly acknowledge that, without the necessary legislation, central bank independence remains largely nominal.\n\nA draft amendment to the Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972 was sent to the Ministry of Finance nearly four months ago. Its objectives include ensuring policy independence, reducing political influence, and strengthening the governor’s constitutional standing.\n\nThe initial draft proposed removing three government officials from the Bangladesh Bank board, granting the governor ministerial rank, and introducing an oath administered by the Chief Justice.\n\nAlthough the draft was softened in response to objections from the Ministry of Finance, it still failed to receive approval—making it clear that the issue is not wording, but control over power.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has long supported greater autonomy for Bangladesh Bank.\n\nUnder the $5.5 billion loan program, the IMF provided direct technical assistance in drafting the reform law.\n\nIn its latest Article IV review, the IMF warned that delays in banking and revenue reforms could jeopardize growth, intensify inflationary pressures, and deepen macroeconomic risks.\n\nYet the statement concluded by noting that key decisions would be taken by the next government—effectively shifting responsibility for reform to the future.\n\nCurbing ownership concentration\n\nThe draft amendment to the Bank Companies Act proposes 45 changes aimed at improving governance.\n\nKey proposals include reducing board size from 20 to 15 members, making at least half of the board independent directors, appointing independent directors from a vetted list prepared by expert committees, and preventing any individual, family, or institution from holding more than 5 percent shares in multiple banks.\n\nBangladesh Bank argues that without these measures, it will be impossible to curb non-performing loans, internal misappropriation, and the dominance of powerful owners.\n\nThe Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB) has opposed the draft, describing ownership limits as “investment deterrents.” Economists counter that the issue is not investment, but control.\n\nFormer World Bank chief economist Zahid Hussain says this is not a technical delay but a question of authority. Reducing the Ministry of Finance’s influence over Bangladesh Bank and limiting the power of bank owners are the real points of contention. In his view, deferring legislation to the next government amounts to avoiding responsibility.\n\nFive-bank merger: reform or buying time?\n\nAs a major reform step, the government merged five weak banks with the stated goals of restoring depositor confidence, reducing state risk, and signalling stability.\n\nThe number of banks fell, administrative costs came somewhat under control, immediate panic was contained, and the message was sent that “no bank will be allowed to fail.”\n\nHowever, the mergers did not address core problems: the mountain of bad loans, politically influenced lending, weak and conflicted boards, ownership concentration, and the central bank’s limited supervisory power.\n\nEconomists warn that the process risks turning “bad banks into a bigger bad bank.”\n\nKeeping the merged banks afloat has increased reliance on central bank liquidity support and state guarantees. Ultimately, the burden of losses is shifting to taxpayers and ordinary depositors.\n\nExperts argue that effective consolidation required strict amendments to the Bank Companies Act, full autonomy for Bangladesh Bank, visible action against responsible directors and loan defaulters, and professional boards and management.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "business", "tokens": 744, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:31:36.482906"}

She continued her onslaught in the second half, scoring a brilliant solo goal from a counter-attack in the 67th minute. Alpi completed her hat-trick in the 82nd minute by calmly tapping in a cross from Kranuching Marma.\n\nThis remarkable performance takes Alpi’s goal tally to seven in just three matches of the tournament, cementing her status as one of the competition’s standout players.\n\nEarlier in the tournament, the Bangladesh side had showcased their scoring prowess with a 12-0 rout of Bhutan in the opening match, followed by a 2-0 victory over India.

I tried to give you back with good tennis over the years.\"\n\nIt had the ring of a farewell speech and did not appear to have been just an emotional response to defeat.\n\nHe said he had prepared two speeches, one for winning and the other for losing.\n\nDjokovic won his 24th Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2023, drawing him level with the Australian Margaret Court at the top of the all-time list.\n\nBut age and injuries, plus the emergence of world number one Alcaraz and number two Jannik Sinner, have left him unable to win another.\n\nBefore Sunday, his previous Grand Slam final had been in 2024, when he lost the Wimbledon decider, again to Alcaraz.\n\nLast year he reached the semi-finals of all four majors but got no further, with Alcaraz and Sinner sharing the spoils.\n\nHe rolled back the years to defeat Sinner -- 14 years his junior -- in a five-set semi-final marathon in Melbourne.\n\nBut after Djokovic won the first set, the 22-year-old Alcaraz took a stranglehold on the final to sweep to victory 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.\n\nUnderlining where Djokovic is now in the pecking order of men's tennis, he admitted he had not expected to reach another major final.\n\nIf the former world number one was going to win that elusive 25th, he may reflect that he has seen his best remaining chance come and go.\n\nHe is the undisputed king of Melbourne Park and Rod Laver Arena is the court where he has had the most success.\n\nThe fourth seed enjoyed two big pieces of luck in reaching the semi-finals.\n\nDjokovic enjoyed free passage through the fourth round when Jakub Mensik pulled out with injury.\n\nHe was then facing defeat at two sets down to Lorenzo Musetti, only for the Italian fifth seed to retire injured.\n\nHe rolled back the years to beat Sinner and make the final, but a repeat success so soon after playing five sets was beyond him.\n\n\"Overall, for sure it's been a fantastic tournament,\" he said.\n\n\"I knew that I'd probably have to beat two of them (Alcaraz and Sinner) on the way to the title.\n\n\"I beat one, which is great, so it's a step more further than I have gone in Grand Slams than last year.\n\n\"Very nice, encouraging. But, you know, not enough for me.\"\n\nSo what next for one of the all-time greats?\n\nFor whatever time is left, he won't give up on that 25th Grand Slam crown, even if the odds are now stacked against him.\n\n\"I always believe I can,\" Djokovic said about finally eclipsing Court.\n\n\"Otherwise, I wouldn't be competing.\"", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "sport", "tokens": 623, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:32:14.567459"}

Bangladesh cited security concerns, but the ICC—despite claiming institutional independence—maintained the original schedule. Scotland was subsequently drafted into the tournament as Bangladesh’s replacement.\n\nThe report suggests that the episode has drawn the attention of IOC officials at a sensitive moment for India. Having recently secured hosting rights for the 2030 Commonwealth Games in Ahmedabad, India is actively positioning itself as a frontrunner for the 2036 Olympics, with Qatar viewed as a key rival.\n\nHowever, IOC sources reportedly indicated that the organisation would find it “unthinkable” to award the Games to a country where geopolitical tensions could lead to boycotts by participating nations.\n\nUnlike the ICC, the IOC enforces a strict separation between sport and political influence. The Olympic Charter mandates complete autonomy for sports bodies, while also prohibiting political or religious expression at the Games.\n\nThe Guardian notes that the IOC’s zero-tolerance stance was demonstrated recently when Indonesia was suspended from hosting discussions after denying visas to Israeli athletes for a world gymnastics event—effectively ending its own 2036 Olympic aspirations.\n\nCricket’s return to the Olympic programme at Los Angeles 2028 and Brisbane 2032 further complicates matters. The IOC views cricket as a strategic addition to attract the Indian market, but sources stressed that commercial appeal would not override governance principles or political neutrality.\n\nThe report also mentions that for India to remain a credible Olympic host contender, it must demonstrate meaningful progress in stabilising sporting relations with neighbours such as Bangladesh and Pakistan.

This is followed by infections at 10% and alcohol consumption at 3%.\n\nAlmost half of all preventable cancers worldwide were attributed to three types: lung, stomach, and cervical cancer. Lung cancer was mainly associated with smoking and air pollution, stomach cancer with Helicobacter pylori infection, and cervical cancer largely with human papillomavirus (HPV).\n\nDr André Ilbawi, WHO Team Lead for Cancer Control and a lead author of the study, said this is the first global assessment to quantify how much cancer risk comes from modifiable causes. He noted that analyzing trends across regions and population groups provides governments and individuals with actionable evidence to prevent many cancers before they develop.\n\nThe study found a notably higher share of preventable cancers among men than women—45% of new cases in men compared with 30% in women. Among men, smoking was the dominant risk factor, responsible for 23% of new cases, followed by infections (9%) and alcohol use (4%). For women, infections were the leading preventable cause at 11%, followed by smoking (6%) and high body mass index (3%).\n\nDr Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the IARC Cancer Surveillance Unit and senior author of the report, described the study as the most comprehensive global evaluation of preventable cancer to date, highlighting the inclusion of infectious causes alongside behavioral, environmental, and occupational risks. She emphasized that tackling these factors offers a major opportunity to reduce the global cancer burden.\n\nPreventable cancer rates varied considerably across regions. Among women, they ranged from 24% in North Africa and West Asia to 38% in sub-Saharan Africa. Among men, East Asia recorded the highest proportion at 57%, while Latin America and the Caribbean had the lowest at 28%. These variations reflect differences in risk exposure, socioeconomic conditions, prevention policies, and health system strength.\n\nThe report calls for tailored prevention strategies, including strong tobacco control, alcohol regulation, vaccination against cancer-causing infections such as HPV and hepatitis B, cleaner air, safer work environments, and healthier diets and physical activity levels.\n\nIt also stresses the importance of coordinated action across multiple sectors—including health, education, energy, transport, and labor—to reduce cancer risk.

The couple ended their 27-year marriage in 2021, reports UNB, citing BBC.\n\nThe comments came after the US Department of Justice released millions of documents linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Among them is an allegation by Epstein claiming Bill Gates contracted a sexually transmitted disease, a claim Gates has strongly denied.\n\n“These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false,” a spokesperson for Bill Gates said. Gates has not been accused of wrongdoing by Epstein’s victims, and his appearance in the files does not suggest any criminal activity.\n\nReflecting on the renewed attention, Melinda French Gates said: “For me, it’s personally hard whenever those details come up, right? Because it brings back memories of some very, very painful times in my marriage.”\n\nShe added: “Whatever questions remain there of what - I can’t even begin to know all of it - those questions are for those people and for even my ex-husband. They need to answer to those things, not me.”\n\nUS media have previously reported that Melinda French Gates was unhappy about her husband’s association with Epstein before their separation. After the divorce was announced, Bill Gates acknowledged having had an affair with a Microsoft employee in 2019.\n\nThe latest allegations appear in more than three million documents released last week. Two emails dated July 18, 2013, appear to have been drafted by Epstein, though it is unclear whether they were ever sent to Gates.

With each passing day, the armed cadres of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) grow increasingly bolder in confronting Pakistan’s security forces, especially the army. A reality that cannot be ignored is that for the first time in Balochistan’s troubled history, the struggle for self-expression by its people has seen an intensification in recent times.\n\nIn the latest attacks by the BLA, scores of people have lost their lives, though the exact figures have not been released by the Islamabad authorities. But Sarfraz Bugti, the chief minister of Balochistan, has made it known that in the aftermath of the rebel assault, 145 of the armed group opposed to the government --- he referred to them, as does the establishment, as terrorists --- had been killed by the security forces.\n\nThe picture is as clear as can be, which is that the bloodletting in Balochistan not only goes on but shows no signs of abating. Indeed, it became clear last year, when the BLA caused mayhem on the Jaffar Express train in Quetta, the provincial capital, that more such attacks would be on the way.\n\nThe coordinated attacks in 14 towns and cities should be a grave reason for worry among those who preside over Pakistan’s fortunes at this point of time. It hardly makes any difference whether or not the army and its supporters denigrate the rebels as Fitna al-Hindustan, a pejorative term that would have one believe that Balochistan’s anti-government elements are actively supported by India.\n\nThe larger reality is that there are individuals and organizations in the province who would like to see the back of the Pakistan government and go forth in the job of setting up an independent republic in Balochistan. In fact, it came to public knowledge last year that some individuals had indeed undertaken measures to have Balochistan declared a sovereign state, though not much traction to the move has been observed.\n\nFor Pakistan’s military, which holds sway over every aspect of social and political life in the country, Saturday’s militant attacks ought to be cause for reflection. Balochistan has turned into extremely dangerous territory, with citizens throughout the province unable to envision better and peaceful times ahead for themselves. The BLA may be a proscribed organization; it may be for Pakistan and its western friends a terrorist outfit.\n\nBut then there is the history of such organizations in the past subjected to similar odious treatment before they successfully emerged victorious in their struggle to ensure freedom for their people. The Islamabad authorities cannot afford to carry on with their belligerency any longer, for when the army in a country finds itself in a situation where it is being targeted by unhappy armed men in a part of the country, there is a serious need for proper reflections on the situation.\n\nPakistan’s military and the federal government in Islamabad need to engage themselves in introspection on the long history of Balochistan’s struggle for self-expression. The Baloch are a proud people who have suffered at the hands of the Pakistan state since the days of Ayub Khan in the 1960s. Baloch have not quite forgotten the manner in which the province was pulled into being part of Pakistan at the time of the partition of India in 1947.\n\nHome to a plethora of tribes, the province has always been a hotbed of trouble for successive Pakistani governments, whose responses to the growing crisis have lacked wisdom. Baloch politicians have seen their elected governments dismissed without any respect for the constitution. Many of these politicians, all of whom are now dead, spent long years in detention.\n\nThe Pakistan state cannot look away from the grievances of the Baloch anymore. Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest but sparsely populated province. It is rich in mineral resources and for decades these resources have been exploited by such government bodies as Pakistan’s geological survey. Its gas resources have benefited the state.\n\nAnd yet the unfortunate truth is that despite all such apparent wealth beneath its soil and in its mountains, Balochistan has remained trapped in impoverishment. Where in the 1960s jute and tea, grown in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), earned foreign exchange that was largely spent in what was then known as West Pakistan, thereby depriving the Bengalis of their rightful share of resources, today it is Baloch resources that are not reflected in Baloch lives.\n\nPakistan, of course, has always been a complex country. Its politics has always been undermined by moves to keep democracy at bay. Its rulers were never able, following partition, to delineate the nature of the federation in relation to the provinces. Worse, the predominance of the army in state affairs has been an endless embarrassment for Pakistan’s people. The embarrassment now grows deeper with Balochistan’s armed rebels adopting such desperate measures as suicide attacks to make their message heard. The message ought to be listened to by the authorities in Islamabad even if too much water has already flowed under the bridge.\n\nHundreds, perhaps more, of Baloch young men have been victims of enforced disappearances by the security forces. The corpses of many of them were discovered much later and that too in several states of decomposition. There are the children of the disappeared who have grown into youth without knowing what happened to their fathers and brothers and sons. When Mahrang Baloch, the vocal young woman demanding that the state respond to Baloch concerns, galvanizes her fellow citizens into stirring up resistance against the manifest injustice perpetrated in Balochistan, she is taken into custody.\n\nWhen Baloch scholars and journalists are hounded to death in the countries where they live in exile, no explanation comes forth from the ruling classes in Islamabad. Nawab Akbar Bugti is killed in a cave by the Pervez Musharraf regime and no inquiry into the crime is initiated. Today, it is Brahamdagh Bugti, an exiled grandson of Akbar Bugti, who plays a public role in disseminating the message of Balochistan’s aspirations before the world.\n\nFor Pakistan’s politicians, whose authority to handle the army is as good as zero, the time has clearly arrived for them to assert authority over the soldiers. Trigger-happy soldiers always muddy the waters in any country where no law can keep them in check and no rules of accountability can restrain them. Balochistan’s situation will worsen in the days ahead. The military has obviously failed to defeat the BLA. It is a war Pakistan’s army has not been winning and the Baloch rebels have not lost.\n\nPakistan’s establishment therefore must go for a political resolution of the crisis. The hubris so far demonstrated by the army needs to be subsumed to the urgency of measures to engage all stakeholders in Balochistan in a purposeful political dialogue as a way of ensuring not only a stable Pakistan but, more importantly, a Balochistan whose people and leaders will have full and unfettered autonomy to conduct their affairs.\n\nThe government in Islamabad as well as the opposition must together reach out to the Baloch rebels and to the tribes --- Marri, Bugti, Mengal, Raisani, et cetera, --- in the search for a settlement. But that will presuppose the suspension of all military activities against Baloch citizens and a readiness to investigate the deaths, disappearances and arrest of all Baloch that have occurred over the decades.\n\nBalochistan’s voice must not be suppressed any longer. A reconfiguring of the Pakistan state is necessary. The rebels control the villages and mountainous regions in Balochistan, a truth the soldiers can ignore at their peril.\n\nSyed Badrul Ahsan writes on politics, diplomacy and history.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "opinion", "tokens": 1292, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:33:46.216516"}

Current estimates suggest a prevalence rate of around 114 cases per 100,000 people, with cancer contributing to nearly 12% of all deaths nationwide.\n\nEach year, more than 160,000 new cancer cases are diagnosed, and the burden is expected to rise sharply as the population ages and non-communicable diseases increase.\n\nBehind these numbers lie stark inequities. While urban patients with financial means may access early diagnosis and treatment, the majority -- especially those in rural and low-income settings -- arrive late, often when cure is no longer possible.\n\nFor them, cancer is not just life-threatening but life-disrupting, pushing families into emotional distress and financial hardship.\n\nTobacco use remains one of the strongest drivers of this crisis. Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of tobacco consumption in South Asia, directly linked to oral, lung, and esophageal cancers. Yet prevention efforts remain fragmented, and public awareness is uneven.\n\n‘United by unique’: What it means\n\nThe idea of being “United by unique” challenges a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer care. Every patient’s experience is shaped by age, gender, income, geography, and family support.\n\nA woman with cervical cancer in a rural district, a child with leukemia, and an elderly man with advanced lung cancer do not need identical care -- but they all need care that is timely, respectful, and compassionate.\n\nThis is where Bangladesh faces its greatest gap.\n\nOur health system is still overwhelmingly focused on treatment, often at the expense of early detection, psychosocial support, and palliative care.\n\nWhen cure is no longer possible, too many patients are left to endure pain in silence -- at home or in overcrowded hospital wards -- without adequate symptom control or emotional support.\n\nThe role of palliative care\n\nCancer care does not end when treatment options are exhausted. Palliative care -- focused on pain relief, symptom management, and psychosocial support -- can dramatically improve quality of life from the moment of diagnosis.\n\nYet in Bangladesh, although an estimated 700,000 people need palliative care each year, only a tiny fraction receives it.\n\nThis gap is not due to lack of need, but lack of prioritization. Palliative care services remain limited to a few urban centres, with severe shortages of trained professionals and restricted access to essential pain medicines such as morphine.\n\nMisconceptions -- among both the public and healthcare providers -- continue to frame palliative care as “giving up,” rather than as an essential component of humane cancer care.\n\nWorld Cancer Day 2026 offers Bangladesh an opportunity to reframe its response. It must acknowledge that equity -- not just technology -- must drive our cancer strategy.\n\nIt means investing in prevention, especially tobacco control; strengthening early detection at the primary healthcare level; and integrating palliative care into universal health coverage.\n\nEvidence from other low- and middle-income countries shows that community-based and home-based palliative care models are both cost-effective and culturally appropriate.\n\nThese approaches reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, protect families from catastrophic health expenditure, and restore dignity to patients at the most vulnerable moments of their lives.\n\nCancer will test Bangladesh’s health system in the coming decades. The question is not whether the burden will grow -- it will -- but whether we are willing to respond with compassion, foresight, and fairness.\n\nPolicymakers must commit to people-centred cancer care, healthcare institutions must invest in training and service integration, and society must break the silence around suffering and death.\n\nMost importantly, we must remember that behind every statistic is a unique human story.\n\nIt is time for cancer care to no longer be measured only by survival rates, but by dignity, relief, and humanity.\n\nThat is the standard a just health system must strive for.\n\nSumit Banikis a Public Health Activist & Trainer.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "opinion", "tokens": 710, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:33:48.216492"}

The question is not whether it is necessary or not, but whether the insurance sector is ready to become a reliable pillar of the country's climate resilience.\n\nPilot projects, such as parametric schemes for cyclones, floods, and micro-insurance for crop loss and farmers, are in progress with support from international organizations like KOIKA, WFP, OXFAM, etc.\n\nAlthough these efforts are significant, it would be dangerous to underestimate the difficulty.\n\nUnderwriting a future disrupted by climate change is extremely difficult due to the insurance industry's current structure. The actuarial challenge of the industry comes first.\n\nAny “risk” is determined by the insurance industry by using past data. However, when the past can no longer accurately predict the future, traditional models lose their credibility.\n\nThe idea of risk pooling may be undermined if premiums for communities in places like Khulna or Satkhira become unaffordable, resulting in a “poverty premium” where the most vulnerable are priced out of protection.\n\nThe second problem is the capacity problem. A significant climate event could cause claims to be made simultaneously over a large geographic area, posing a systemic risk.\n\nThe ability of the domestic insurance industry's combined capital to cover both a drought, a cold wave, a devastating cyclone, and widespread crop failure during the same season is debatable.\n\nThe most likely response calls for an open discussion of the necessity of significant reinsurance from the international market, as well as creative risk-pooling techniques like sovereign insurance facilities. Another issue is how adept domestic insurers are at navigating these intricate international instruments.\n\nThe problem of distribution and trust comes in third. Bangladesh has a very low insurance penetration rate (about 1% of GDP). The idea is frequently foreign in rural areas, and there is a lack of confidence in institutions.\n\nIt is doubtful that agents could adequately explain to a farmer in Gaibandha a parametric trigger, in which payouts are determined by verified weather data instead of individual loss assessments.\n\nIt requires collaboration with NGOs, microfinance organizations, and local governments to develop this literacy and trust. These obstacles, however, are not insurmountable; rather, they serve as a guide for an essential change.\n\nThe insurance industry's readiness should be evaluated based on its willingness to undergo a fundamental evolution rather than its current state.\n\nThis evolution needs a tripartite pact as follows:\n\nThe ultimate question is not merely one of “readiness,” but of urgency and resolve.“Climate risk insurance” is way more than just another product; it is a social contract. It is a guarantee that a family's life’s work will not be destroyed without recourse due to climate-induced disasters like drought, cold waves, floods, cyclones, or prolonged waterlogging.\n\nFor Bangladesh, perfect readiness is an unattainable luxury. The nation must build on existing pilot programs, learn from experience, adapt strategies, and scale efforts.\n\nThe premium paid today is not just for financial compensation but an investment in collective resilience, ensuring that when the next disaster strikes, as it inevitably will, communities can recover with dignity and speed, rather than merely survive.\n\nThe industry's transformation must commence immediately, for time is of the essence.\n\nDr Anwar Hossain Chowdhury is an Assistant Professor at the Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM), Dhaka.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/402442/the-plastic-paradox-when-waste-becomes-a-climate", "title": "The plastic paradox: When waste becomes a climate solution", "body": "In Mongla, climate change is not an abstract threat but a reality. Rising salinity, erratic weather patterns, and increasingly frequent cyclones have steadily reshaped the region's farming systems, narrowing crop choices.\n\nFor farmers in this region, adaptation is no longer optional; it is now a necessity to cope with an environment that is increasingly hostile with each passing season.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, a curious sight has begun to appear in vegetable fields: Dark, sturdy posts standing firm against the soil.\n\nThese supports are not bamboo or timber, materials farmers have long relied on, but now are increasingly ill-suited to Mongla's saline and moisture-heavy conditions.\n\nInstead, these supports are made entirely from recovered plastic waste that was once scattered across coastal settlements in Cox's Bazar.\n\nWhat was previously a persistent environmental burden, clogging drains, waterways, and open water bodies due to its long lifespan, this plastic is now recycled and repurposed to support crops, reduce farmers' costs, and point towards a new way of thinking about both single-use plastic waste and climate resilience.\n\nCoastal Bangladesh sits at the intersection of vulnerability and opportunity. In areas like Mongla, dry-season soil salinity has reached levels that severely limit crop choices, while cyclones and tidal surges regularly inundate farmland with saltwater.\n\nMany traditional agricultural materials degrade quickly under such conditions. Bamboo rots, timber weakens, concrete corrodes, and pests thrive. Farmers are forced into a costly cycle of seasonal replacement that is both financially draining and environmentally unsustainable.\n\nAt the same time, Bangladesh is grappling with a growing plastic pollution crisis. Low-value plastics used in single-use packaging, such as polypropylene and high-density polyethene, rarely enter formal recycling systems.\n\nInstead, they clog canals, fill landfills and worsen flooding, particularly in urban and coastal areas. While agriculture struggles with material scarcity, waste management systems are overwhelmed by plastic that they cannot absorb.\n\nSometimes, solutions emerge when two problems collide.\n\nIn September 2025, a visit by BRAC's Climate Change Program to the Cox's Bazar Municipal recycling facility sparked a rethink. Under an existing initiative, recycled plastic lumber had been earmarked for commercial uses such as furniture or construction. Standing amid recycling machinery, the question arose almost instinctively: Could this material serve a purpose in agriculture?\n\nThe idea was deceptively simple. If recycled plastic beams were strong, durable, pest-resistant, and capable of withstanding coastal weather, why not test them where such qualities were most needed? Mongla's fields offered the answer.\n\nRather than focusing solely on reducing plastic's carbon footprint, this initiative began to explore something more ambitious: The positive climate impact of replacing fragile or carbon-intensive materials with a resilient, recycled alternative.\n\nEach beam produced at the Cox's Bazar Municipal Recycling Facility weighs just over 3 kilograms and is made from an even blend of polypropylene and high-density polyethene.\n\nIn total, 500 units were manufactured, reintroducing 1.65 tons of plastic waste into productive use.\n\nUnlike bamboo, these beams do not rot, attract pests, or require seasonal replacement.\n\nDesigned to last for years, they reduce pressure on timber resources while offering farmers a reliable alternative that suits their environmental realities.\n\nFrom a climate and emissions perspective, the benefits are substantial. Producing 1,650 kilograms of recycled plastic lumber through open-loop recycling generated just 10.6 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e).\n\nHad the same plastic waste gone to landfill, it would have produced 14.7 kilograms of CO₂e -- emissions now fully avoided.\n\nCompared to manufacturing the same amount of lumber from virgin plastic, which would have generated 4,665 kilograms of CO₂e, using recycled material prevented over 4.6 tons of emissions.\n\nEven against wooden alternatives, producing equivalent beams would have emitted hundreds of kilograms of CO₂e, along with the ecological costs of increased timber harvesting. These calculations were conducted by BRAC's Climate Change Program.\n\nThe benefits are immediate and practical. Farmers spend less on replacement materials, crops gain stronger support, and agricultural systems become less vulnerable to climate stress. But the implications go further.\n\nThis initiative represents circular economy thinking applied where it matters most. Plastic waste collected from one coastal town becomes a resource strengthening food production in another.\n\nTwo seemingly separate crises, plastic pollution and climate-stressed agriculture, are addressed through a single intervention.\n\nThis is not only about mitigation. It is about adaptation and resilience. Agriculture becomes less dependent on fragile materials, and communities gain infrastructure designed for their environmental reality rather than borrowed from less hostile contexts.\n\nThere is, of course, scepticism. Plastic is widely perceived as dirty, unreliable, and inferior, particularly when associated with food production.\n\nOvercoming such perceptions requires not only technical evidence but trust, demonstration and time. The Mongla trial is still in its early stages, but it already offers valuable lessons.\n\nInnovation flourishes when programs collaborate across sectors. Local solutions work best when rooted in local conditions, and changing perceptions is as much a part of climate action as engineering or finance.\n\nFrom Cox's Bazar, where the waste was collected, to Mongla, where it now anchors crops against wind and rain, this initiative tells a broader story. It is not just about recycling plastic; it is about reimagining value in a warming world.\n\nThe plastic paradox is this: what once polluted our land may yet help protect it. From Cox's Bazar, where discarded waste was collected, to Mongla, where it quietly takes root in the soil, this initiative moves beyond recycling to reimagine value in unexpected ways. Each recycled beam carries a subtle reminder that resilience is not always something imported or invented. Sometimes, it begins with what is already in our hands, waiting for us to see its potential and rethink what we once considered waste.\n\nFor the farmers of Mongla, resilience isn't just about surviving; it's about thriving in a changing world where what was once discarded may now hold the key to their future.\n\nKamran Ibne Abdul Qader is a Senior Specialist, Knowledge Management and Communications, Climate Change Program, BRAC.

It is a national public health imperative.\n\nTobacco use remains alarmingly prevalent in Bangladesh. More than 35% of adults -- around 37.8 million people -- use tobacco in smoked or smokeless forms. Each year, tobacco-related diseases claim an estimated 200,000 lives.\n\nThe economic burden is equally severe: Health care costs, productivity losses, and environmental damage together amount to nearly Tk870 billion annually -- more than double the revenue generated by the tobacco sector.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, strengthening tobacco control is not a policy choice but an urgent necessity.\n\nThe 2025 amendment updates Bangladesh’s tobacco control framework to address evolving industry tactics and emerging products.\n\nIt brings electronic nicotine delivery systems, heated tobacco products, nicotine pouches, and similar products firmly under regulatory oversight; strengthens smoke-free public spaces; expands bans on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship -- particularly across digital platforms; and increases penalties for violations.\n\nThese measures are grounded in scientific evidence and aligned with Bangladesh’s obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), as well as the Sustainable Development Goals, including the commitment to reduce premature deaths from non-communicable diseases.\n\nThis reform did not emerge overnight. Initiated in 2021, the amendment went through extensive public consultations, technical reviews, and inter-ministerial scrutiny.\n\nApproved in December 2025 under the interim government and subsequently gazetted, the ordinance reflects years of advocacy and policy engagement aimed at safeguarding public health -- especially the health of children and young people.\n\nImportantly, the ordinance closes long-standing regulatory loopholes that the tobacco industry has repeatedly exploited. By removing designated smoking areas, it ensures genuinely smoke-free public places.\n\nBy extending comprehensive bans on advertising, promotion, and sponsorship across both traditional and digital media, it responds directly to the industry’s shifting marketing strategies.\n\nAnd by rejecting the misleading narrative of “reduced-harm” products, it prevents addictive substances from being repackaged and promoted to a new generation.\n\nYet this landmark public health achievement now faces its most critical test.\n\nAs an ordinance, the amendment must be placed before Parliament and approved within the constitutionally mandated timeframe after the first parliamentary session begins.\n\nWith national elections expected in February 2026, responsibility will rest squarely with the incoming Parliament. Any delay risks the ordinance lapsing -- undoing years of progress and weakening protections that are urgently needed.\n\nHistory offers a clear warning. After the 2013 amendment to the tobacco control law, tobacco companies used litigation and delay tactics to obstruct implementation, most notably in the case of pictorial health warnings.\n\nThe Global Tobacco Industry Interference Index 2025 once again ranks Bangladesh among the countries most affected by industry interference, highlighting the continued influence of both local and multinational tobacco companies during the recent amendment process.\n\nIn this context, hesitation, dilution, or reopening of settled provisions would serve only commercial interests -- at the direct expense of public health.\n\nParliament must therefore act decisively and send an unambiguous message: The health of the people comes before industry pressure.\n\nSustained engagement from the administration, civil society, and the media will be essential -- both before and after the election -- to keep this issue firmly on the parliamentary agenda. But ultimately, the responsibility lies with lawmakers.\n\nBangladesh has earned international recognition for its leadership in tobacco control. By swiftly enacting the Smoking and Tobacco Products Use (Control) (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025 and transforming this ordinance into law, the next Parliament can uphold that legacy -- and, more importantly, protect lives, prevent avoidable deaths, shield non-smokers, and secure a healthier future for generations to come.\n\nZahirul Alam is Executive Director, Channel 24.

This is not negotiable anymore if we mean business.\n\nResponding to mounting pressure from both domestic business leaders and international development partners, the interim government started to talk about an ambitious reform program. With limited success from the interim government, this has now become a must for the new government -- whoever comes after the election.\n\nI believe at the heart of this effort should lie the proposal to establish a “Regulatory Reform Commission (RRC)”, a dedicated body tasked with overhauling archaic rules and processes that constrain economic activity.\n\nThe RRC's role must be continuous and proactive: Monitoring, evaluating, and streamlining the full spectrum of economic, especially business-related regulations.\n\nThis is not Bangladesh's first attempt. Back in 2007, under the caretaker government, a similar commission led by the late Dr Akbar Ali Khan (former finance and cabinet secretary and the alternate executive director at The World Bank) was formed but ultimately dissolved without significant impact due to a lack of political continuity as well as commitment.\n\nExperts now argue that this opportunity must not be squandered. From my engagement with the earlier “Better Business Forum” which helped establish the original RRC, I can say with confidence that business owners repeatedly emphasized that if reforms were left solely to line ministries, little progress would occur. We need a central authority with a clear mandate and strong political backing.\n\nThe need for reform is also evident in the data. Bangladesh continues to lag behind its regional peers in business environment metrics.\n\nIn early 2025, the country scored just 56.99 out of 100 in the “regulatory framework” pillar, placing it in the bottom quintile among 50 surveyed economies.\n\nDespite positive steps, such as digitalization of trade documentation and one-stop service initiatives, entrepreneurs still face regulatory uncertainty that stifles innovation and deters investment.\n\nForeign direct investment in FY2024 dropped by 5%, a worrying sign for an economy reliant on private capital to fuel growth.\n\nRecent economic headwinds have made reform even more urgent. GDP growth declined to 1.8% in the July-September 2024 quarter, prompting the World Bank to revise its annual forecast to 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic revenue grew only 3.7% in the first quarter of FY25, compared to 17.7% year-over-year. Recognizing these pressures, the government has secured over $3 billion in funding from the World Bank, with a significant portion earmarked for regulatory and structural reforms.\n\nAnalysts have pointed to two key challenges in the regulatory landscape as\n\n(1) Many regulations are outdated and irrelevant;\n\n(2) The country lacks frameworks to govern emerging technologies and business models.\n\nRegulators are consistently behind the curve. This mismatch between policy and progress reinforces the case for a permanent reform commission.\n\nTo be more than a token initiative, the RRC must be enshrined in law and operate beyond political cycles.\n\nLooking back at the earlier commission, we should now push for a three-tiered structure:\n\nThe earlier commission made real progress when it had support from the “Better Business Forum” and from strong leadership. It must again function as part of a broader public-private ecosystem.\n\nThe task is clear. Bangladesh must shift from reactive, piecemeal regulation to a strategic, forward-looking approach. A well-functioning Regulatory Reform Commission can deliver just that -- not merely by cutting red tape, but by making the economy more adaptive, inclusive, and competitive in a fast-changing world.\n\nNo more behaving as if we are on a desolate island. We must face the world. Success, performance, corporate governance, competition, and business ethics must carry the same meaning here too.\n\nMamun Rashid is former CEO at Citibank NA, Bangladesh and founding managing partner of PwC Bangladesh.

It is an issue that demands immediate attention.\n\nAgriculture sustains nearly half of our total workforce, not to mention its role in addressing food security. As such, while policies towards other more industrial sectors are necessary, agriculture itself cannot be set aside.\n\nWhen farmers face hurdles in accessing credit, subsidies, and fair prices, while big businesses benefit from generous packages with little accountability, it reflects not just an unjust imbalance, but one that is unsustainable for us.\n\nAgriculture has long carried our nation through crises, yet we continue squeezing farmers due to rising input costs, inadequate infrastructure, and the absence of meaningful state support. Without urgent reform, agriculture risks stagnation, leaving the entire nation vulnerable.\n\nIncentives must therefore also strengthen agriculture, not just industry. Farmers need accessible credit, fair procurement systems, and investment in storage, irrigation, and transport, while policy support must ensure that middlemen and syndicates do not profit off of the hard work farmers continue to do.\n\nWe cannot hope to have inclusive progress while neglecting those who feed us.

Elections are not merely contests for power; they are tests of truth, responsibility, and respect for the people.\n\nUnfortunately, recent statements and campaign rhetoric by senior leaders of a religion-based party contesting for election reveal a troubling pattern -- one that relies not on policy, evidence, or a development vision, but on provocation, misinformation, and historical amnesia.\n\nDisturbingly, this language echoes the logic and temperament of past autocratic regimes, runs counter to the democratic spirit of the July 2024 popular uprising, and risks perpetuating the very cycle of fear, division, and hatred that the people of Bangladesh have repeatedly rejected.\n\nOne such claim that the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (DUCSU), an institution inseparable from Bangladesh’s democratic and liberation history, is an “epicentre of drugs and prostitution,” is not just false but reckless.\n\nDhaka University has been the cradle of our Language Movement, the mass uprising of 1969, and the intellectual backbone of the Liberation War. Generations of teachers and students from this campus paid with their lives so that Bangladesh could exist as a sovereign state. To casually malign such an institution is to insult not a building or a union, but the nation’s collective memory.\n\nDisagreement with student politics, debate over governance, or calls for reform are all legitimate in a democracy. Character assassination is not.\n\nWhen political discourse descends into sensational accusations without evidence, it reflects a deeper absence: The absence of ideas, programs, and credible solutions to people’s real problems: Jobs, prices, health care, education, and dignity.\n\nThe same pattern emerges in recent attacks on Tarique Rahman, the Chairman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. At a time when he has consistently articulated a policy-oriented political vision, centring on health, education, employment, agriculture, women’s empowerment, environmental protection, sports, and social dignity, criticism should engage with those ideas.\n\nDemocracies mature when policies are debated, not when personalities are vilified through distortion and rumour. Personal denunciation, detached from facts and policy substance, contributes little to voters who are increasingly demanding seriousness and solutions.\n\nThis contrast between politics grounded in development and politics driven by conspiracy has become stark. While one side speaks of reforming primary health care, empowering women through economic security, supporting farmers with transparent systems, and engaging youth through education and skills, the other appears to rely heavily on whisper campaigns, social-media disinformation, and transactional inducements. Bangladesh’s voters are far more discerning today than such tactics assume.\n\nHistory, too, deserves honesty. In 1947, a certain party opposed the Bengali linguistic and cultural aspirations within Pakistan. In 1971, it aligned itself with the Pakistan military regime, actively collaborating against the Liberation War and standing on the wrong side of history when millions of Bengalis demanded freedom. Later, in the late 1980s, its political choices contributed to prolonging the autocratic rule of General Ershad, delaying the restoration of democracy.\n\nThese are not partisan interpretations but established historical facts acknowledged by scholars, journalists, and citizens across generations. A democratic society cannot move forward by erasing or reframing such realities. Reconciliation with history begins with truth, not denial.\n\nNone of this is an argument against faith, religious values, or the role of morality in public life. Bangladesh is a deeply spiritual society, and its Constitution guarantees religious freedom and pluralism. But faith-based ethics must elevate politics, not degrade it. Religion, when used as a shield for misinformation or as a tool to delegitimize national institutions, loses its moral force and public trust.\n\nThe choice before Bangladesh is therefore not between parties alone, but between political cultures. One culture respects institutions, engages in policy debate, and trusts voters with facts. The other thrives on rumours, provocations, and selective memory. One looks forward to building an inclusive, opportunity-driven Bangladesh. The other remains trapped in tactics that belong to an earlier, darker chapter of our political life.\n\nBangladesh’s citizens, especially its youth, have changed. They are better informed, more globally connected, and less tolerant of empty rhetoric. They want politics that speaks to their future, not politics that weaponizes the past or maligns the very institutions that made that future possible.\n\nIn this election, truth itself is on the ballot. And history has shown, time and again, that when Bangladeshis are given a clear choice between fear and hope, between rumour and reason, they choose dignity, democracy, and progress.\n\nZiauddin Hyder is Adviser to the Chairman, Bangladesh Nationalist Party and former Senior Health Specialist of World Bank.

It began with the urge to communicate. Communication was slow, deliberate, and deeply tied to survival. Over centuries, this urge evolved through letters, messengers, telegraphs, telephones, and broadcast media.\n\nToday, humanity inhabits a world where communication is instant, boundless, and relentless. What remains uncertain is whether our capacity to think, judge, and reason has kept pace with this speed.\n\nThe digital revolution has created an unprecedented paradox. Never before has information been so accessible, and never before has confusion been so widespread. With a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can reach millions within seconds.\n\nThis technological empowerment, however, has exposed a fundamental weakness in modern societies, particularly in developing countries. While digital tools have spread rapidly, intellectual readiness has lagged behind. The result is an environment where truth and falsehood coexist so closely that distinguishing between them often feels unnecessary or even inconvenient.\n\nIn many parts of the world, education systems struggle to cultivate critical thinking. Memorization is rewarded, questioning is discouraged, and authority is rarely challenged. Into this fragile intellectual landscape enters digital media, carrying both knowledge and deception.\n\nOn one side lies the promise of learning, awareness, and connection. On the other lies a flood of fabricated claims, emotional manipulation, and deliberate misinformation. The same platform that can host a scientific lecture can also circulate a dangerous lie with equal ease.\n\nHealth misinformation illustrates this crisis with alarming clarity. Social media feeds are crowded with claims of miracle cures, secret remedies, and instant solutions to complex diseases. Often, these messages are accompanied by the image or name of a reputed doctor, lending them an illusion of credibility.\n\nBright colours, confident language, and simplified explanations make the content attractive and persuasive. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is used to refine these messages, making them appear professional and authoritative.\n\nFor many readers, verification feels unnecessary. The impulse is to believe first and share quickly, driven by concern, hope, or fear. In this process, false information multiplies at a speed that truth cannot match.\n\nThe danger extends far beyond personal health. Religion, politics, and economics have all become fertile grounds for manipulation. Selective quotations and distorted interpretations inflame religious sentiment. Fabricated political narratives polarise societies and undermine trust. Economic rumours trigger panic, hoarding, and instability.\n\nSometimes misinformation is crafted to scam people financially. Sometimes it is designed to influence elections or provoke unrest. At other times, it is driven by nothing more than the pursuit of attention and online popularity. In the digital economy, outrage has become currency.\n\nThe effectiveness of such deception is not uniform across societies. Where education emphasizes reasoning, debate, and evidence, misinformation faces resistance. Citizens in these societies are more likely to ask basic questions: Who is the source? What proof exists? Is this claim supported by credible institutions?\n\nSuch habits do not eliminate falsehood entirely, but they limit its impact. In contrast, where questioning authority is culturally discouraged and media literacy is weak, misinformation spreads with little friction. Belief becomes easier than doubt.\n\nThere was a time when mistakes were part of learning and their consequences were limited. In the digital age, errors carry far greater costs. A single false message can cause irreversible damage.\n\nA rumour can ignite violence. A manipulated video can destroy a person’s reputation overnight. An unverified claim can shape public opinion in ways that alter national policy. Learning through error in such an environment is no longer a private experience. It becomes a collective risk.\n\nResponsibility for this crisis cannot be placed on individuals alone. States have a clear role to play.\n\nFreedom of expression is essential, but it does not absolve governments of their duty to protect citizens from harm. The absence of thoughtful regulation allows dangerous content to circulate unchecked.\n\nThis does not mean imposing blunt censorship, which often backfires. It means investing seriously in public education, digital literacy, and institutional transparency. Citizens must be equipped with the skills needed to navigate information critically, not merely consume it passively.\n\nEqually significant is the role of technology companies. Social media platforms are not neutral mirrors of society. Their algorithms actively shape what people see, prioritizing content that generates reactions.\n\nAnger, fear, and excitement travel faster than calm analysis. Falsehood often performs better than truth because it is designed to provoke emotion. While platform owners frequently claim technical limitations or political neutrality, their business models depend on engagement, and engagement often rewards misinformation. Ignoring this structural bias is an ethical failure.\n\nAt the heart of the problem lies a deeper contradiction. Truth is often complex, conditional, and uncomfortable. It requires patience and context. Falsehood, by contrast, is simple, dramatic, and reassuring.\n\nIn a digital environment driven by speed and visibility, simplicity wins. This does not mean technology itself is the enemy. Tools do not possess intent. Their consequences are determined by how they are designed, regulated, and used. But when technological power expands faster than ethical awareness, imbalance becomes inevitable.\n\nEducation remains the most reliable defense, but it must evolve beyond traditional boundaries. Teaching students how to pass examinations is insufficient. Societies must prioritize critical thinking, media literacy, and ethical reasoning as core life skills.\n\nPeople need to understand how algorithms influence perception, how images and language manipulate emotion, and how to distinguish evidence from assertion. This responsibility does not rest with schools alone. Families, journalists, educators, and civil institutions all shape the intellectual environment in which citizens grow.\n\nThe spread of misinformation is not merely a social nuisance. It undermines the foundations of collective decision-making. Democracies depend on informed judgment. When public discourse is dominated by distortion and lies, rational policy becomes difficult, if not impossible.\n\nA society that cannot agree on basic facts cannot solve complex problems. Over time, this erosion of trust weakens institutions, deepens divisions, and damages the future it seeks to build.\n\nThe digital age promised liberation from ignorance, and in many ways it has delivered unprecedented access to information. Marginal voices have found platforms. Knowledge has escaped traditional gatekeepers.\n\nYet access without discernment is a fragile form of empowerment. When people possess powerful communication tools without the intellectual discipline to use them responsibly, those tools can amplify their vulnerabilities rather than their strengths.\n\nThe true measure of progress is not how fast information travels, but how wisely it is handled. Civilizations rise not merely on innovation, but on judgment. If human reasoning fails to mature alongside technological advancement, progress becomes unstable. The challenge of our time is not to retreat from technology, but to cultivate the wisdom required to live with it.\n\nThe digital era will only fulfil its promise when societies learn to value truth over excitement, evidence over assertion, and understanding over instant reaction. Without this shift, the tools designed to connect and enlighten may instead entangle us in confusion.\n\nThe danger does not lie in machines becoming too powerful, but in human judgment remaining unprepared for the power it now holds.\n\nHM Nazmul Alam is an academic, journalist, and political analyst based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

CEOs waited for focus groups. You picked up the phone or opened the door to a stranger with a clipboard, and they asked you what you thought. Your answer was stored, counted, and months later a decision was made. That was the world of the 20th century. Slow-moving. Ordered. Predictable.\n\nBut that world is gone.\n\nToday, nobody waits to be asked anything. We do not whisper our opinions into small surveys. We shout them into the internet. We tweet, post, react, rant, joke, and argue in real time.\n\nAnd as we do, machines listen.\n\nThis listening has a name: Social media sentiment analysis. It is the quiet engine underneath politics, elections, business, news, and public life.\n\nAnd whether we know it or not, it is shaping the world around us, sometimes reflecting our feelings, sometimes steering them.\n\nFrom counting words to reading emotions\n\nIn the early days, sentiment analysis was very simple. Computers just counted words.\n\n“Good,” “love,” “amazing” = positive.\n\n“Bad,” “hate,” “awful” = negative.\n\nBut humans are not simple. We use sarcasm. We joke. We code-switch. Sometimes “sick” means “cool.” Sometimes “great job” means “you ruined everything.” The machines failed again and again.\n\nSo the technology evolved.\n\nNew AI models, like BERT and modern large language systems, began to read context. They no longer saw words floating alone. They understood tone. They recognized slang. They learned political language. They even began to understand when different groups used the same word in different emotional ways.\n\nAnd now, AI doesn’t only judge whether we are positive or negative. It tries to detect anger, fear, joy, disgust, shock, love, and even sarcasm. It reads video and listens to audio. It can analyze millions of posts in seconds.\n\nMost importantly, it doesn’t wait for permission.\n\nWe don’t give answers. We leak them.\n\nIndia: The ground war of encrypted politics\n\nIf the United States is the loudspeaker of global politics, India is the whisper network.\n\nIn India, the heart of political life does not live on Twitter or TikTok. It lives on WhatsApp, a closed, encrypted world of group chats -- neighbours, families, priests, activists, and party workers.\n\nPolitical parties organize vast networks of volunteers who run local WhatsApp groups like micro-news channels. Messages move from the national level to states, districts, and finally neighborhoods.\n\nSometimes these messages are news.\n\nSometimes they are opinions.\n\nSometimes they are rumours.\n\nSentiment analysis tools cannot directly see inside WhatsApp. So analysts track what leaks out, hashtags, keywords, timing patterns.\n\nA single instruction sent through thousands of groups can cause a flood of identical tweets at the same second, creating a “trend.”\n\nFrom the outside it looks like public opinion.\n\nInside, it is often organized choreography.\n\nBut this machine does not only help parties win elections. It also shapes policy. When the Indian government proposes a law and social media turns sharply negative, leaders sometimes withdraw the policy within days.\n\nIs that democracy working? Or democracy panicking?\n\nThe line grows thinner every year.\n\nBangladesh: Sentiment, rumours, and political pressure\n\nIn Bangladesh today, this digital ocean of emotions is not just chatter, it is politically consequential and measurable. Long before the upcoming election, social media has become a live arena where public mood, party narratives, and voter expectations shift in real time.\n\nOnline sentiment patterns reveal a clear emotional tilt toward opposition politics. Across digital conversations, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) dominates positive and mobilizing sentiment, accounting for roughly four out of every 10 expressions of electoral preference.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami follows with a substantial share of approval-driven discourse, particularly in conversations framed around governance reform, moral authority, and protest politics. By contrast, sentiment surrounding the ruling Awami League skews markedly more negative, with approval signals lagging in the mid-teens and discussion often shaped by frustration, fatigue, and distrust.\n\nJust as powerful is expectation sentiment. A strong majority of online political discussion reflects the belief that the opposition is more likely to win the next election. That belief matters.\n\nWhen people think political change is coming, they speak louder, share more aggressively, and persuade undecided voters with confidence. Momentum becomes emotional before it becomes electoral.\n\nYet this landscape is volatile. Political propaganda and polls-related misinformation surge across Facebook, X, and TikTok, spreading faster than verified information.\n\nFabricated quotes, selectively edited videos, and exaggerated claims spike around key moments, court rulings, arrests, protests, speeches, intensifying fear, anger, and moral outrage.\n\nFact-checking patterns consistently show that politics dominates misinformation ecosystems, and that emotionally charged content travels farther than corrections. False narratives often land first. Clarifications arrive late.\n\nThe consequences are visible. Rumours move so fast that leaders are frequently forced to deny events that never happened. Silence is read as guilt. Delay as weakness. Nuance as evasion.\n\nWhat makes Bangladesh particularly sensitive to this dynamic is scale. For millions, especially outside elite urban circles, Facebook functions as a primary source of political information. Algorithms reward engagement, not deliberation. Sensational and emotional content outruns policy discussion every time.\n\nAs a result, the emotional tone of political discourse online is no longer just reflected in sentiment dashboards, it is shaped by them. Shifts in online mood increasingly function as proxies for political momentum. For parties racing toward the election, understanding these emotional undercurrents is no longer optional. It is now part of the terrain of power itself.\n\nThe US: The open-air sentiment battlefield\n\nIn the United States, nothing is quiet. Politics lives in the open, feeding algorithms that love conflict. On TikTok, Instagram, and X, political influencers now outrank traditional news outlets in reach.\n\nAnd here is the secret: Anger travels faster than facts.\n\nSentiment skews negative by design. Outrage gets likes. Sarcasm gets clicks. Fear spreads. Campaigns monitor this river of emotion not just to react but to target.\n\nWho is anxious? Who feels ignored? Who is unsure?\n\nEach group receives different messages, carefully crafted to press emotional buttons. This is where sentiment analysis meets psychology. The tools no longer study “the public.” They study you.\n\nNot to learn. But to persuade. Or sometimes, simply to discourage you from voting at all.\n\nBusiness learns the hard way\n\nIf politics uses sentiment to chase votes, companies use it to protect profits.\n\nWhen Bud Light partnered with a transgender influencer, sentiment algorithms detected a wave of negative emotion that didn’t fade. It hardened. Sales collapsed. The brand lost billions in market value. Silence made it worse. Online outrage escaped the internet and entered bars, grocery stores, and homes.\n\nThe lesson was brutal: In the age of sentiment, delay is death.\n\nBut sentiment can also save.\n\nWhen the Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer came out, audiences hated the character design. The data was overwhelming. Instead of ignoring it, the studio changed course. They redesigned the character. The movie became a hit.\n\nThis wasn’t a focus group. This was the internet as a co-creator.\n\nWhen Taylor Swift began appearing at NFL games, the emotional map of American football changed overnight. New fans flooded the conversation. Sentiment soared. The NFL embraced it. The result was a surge in viewership and hundreds of millions in brand value.\n\nEmotion, when harnessed, can print money.\n\nSo what happens when leaders check sentiment dashboards like weather apps?\n\nOn one hand, this feels democratic. Power hears the public instantly. People once invisible now appear on the radar.\n\nBut there is a darker side. Bots can fake outrage. Influencers can engineer trends. Campaigns can plant emotions like seeds.\n\nAnd because leaders fear negative waves, the loudest emotions often win -- not the wisest ideas. Long-term policies die because short-term anger spikes.\n\nAre we listening to the people? Or are we being trained by a machine that rewards outrage?\n\nHere is the most important shift:We once measured public opinion. Now we create it.\n\nPlatforms amplify posts not because they are true, but because they trigger emotion. Those emotions feed sentiment dashboards.\n\nLeaders react. Their reaction fuels more posts. The machine loops.\n\nThe observer and the observed now shape each other.\n\nThe machine does not just listen to the crowd.

Instead, they are widely viewed as rhetorical expressions used in political discourse rather than legal or ideological classifications grounded in party doctrine.\n\nIn theory, the termudarponthiimplies moderation, inclusiveness, and democratic values. However, critics argue that in the current political context the label has lost its positive connotation among many citizens.\n\nPublic perception, they say, is increasingly shaped by lived experience rather than political slogans.\n\nAllegations of extortion, suppression of dissent, and prolonged one-party dominance have led some voters to question whether claims of moderation align with actual governance practices.\n\nOn the other hand, the termugroponthihas long been used in Bangladesh’s political arena to describe or discredit right-leaning and Islamic political parties.\n\nPolitical commentators point out that such labeling has often occurred without clear definition or judicial basis, contributing to a culture of political stigmatization.\n\nMany citizens now view this practice as an attempt to delegitimize opposition voices rather than engage in substantive political debate.\n\nObservers also highlight growing public resistance to what they describe as “tagging and colouring” politics.

Economies are complicated places, there are many moving parts, so any one number can have more than one explanation.\n\nIt's also true that there are many economic models that we can use at any one time. The art of economics is to select the correct model to explain -- or investigate -- the particular thing we are interested in at the moment.\n\nAs a general rule but not a perfect one, all economic models explain something usefully, and none of them explain everything. Model selection is therefore everything.\n\nSo, a writer forthis newspapersays that even as the economy is growing, deposits in banks are not growing. We could, as the assumption is made, think that this is a bad thing.\n\nPeople have less to save -- less to deposit -- after paying for life. That's a perfectly respectable, entirely sensible, reaction to the number. But is it the correct one?\n\nTo walk away from this specific to something more general. Thomas Piketty, the French economist, has been complaining loudly for years that the ratio of capital or wealth to GDP has been rising. He then says this is going to send us all back to Jane Austen days where inheritance will be everything and no one will be able to work their way up.\n\nTherefore, tax rich people more. Just as an individual thing, I come from Bath and used to walk past Jane Austen's house regularly -- in fact, used to work next door to it. I've even worked -- as a teenage waiter -- in the ballroom she used to attend and in which nearly all of the movies are filmed.\n\nBack to Jane Austen days doesn't scare me all that much. Just to give out too much personal information, the opening scenes of Bridgerton (which is not, not, Jane Austen!) shows the outside of my apartment.\n\nIt is possible to run with the Piketty idea. It's also possible to explain the same number another way.\n\nWealth, capital, is the stock of society. GDP is the income we gain from that. So, if the wealth to GDP ratio is rising, then we're becoming less efficient at turning our assets into income.\n\nExplaining the same number that way leads to another conclusion: We should have less bureaucracy, less government, so that we increase efficiency. The same number that Piketty is using but the different model leads to an entirely different solution. Which is right? Well, that's the art of economics.\n\nOne of the odd truths of economic numbers is that when we measure by wealth -- wealth, not income -- there are more poor people in the US, and they are poorer, than there are in Bangladesh. This is because the US banking system -- the whole financial system -- allows people with no assets to borrow.\n\nSo, people can have negative wealth -- a student with college loans, someone with no assets, a job and a credit card balance -- and so that's just true. An efficient financial system can mean that because people can borrow then there are more people with negative wealth.\n\nAnother odd number. The Federal Reserve asks a regular question: If you had a $400 bill -- the heating system needed repair, say, -- thenhow would you pay for it? 37% say they wouldn't use cash, they would borrow.\n\nOK, we can think of this in two ways. One is that this is appalling, 37% of US households don't have enough cash to pay a $400 emergency bill. The other is that the US financial system is so efficient that people who might face a $400 emergency bill don't need to save cash to maybe pay it. If it does happen -- the emergency -- then they can borrow and pay that back later.\n\nWhich model we use, which story we tell about the number, makes a difference.\n\nDeposits in Bangladeshi banks are falling? Is that because Bangladeshi households have less money to save after meeting expenses? Or is that because the financial system is getting better so that Bangladeshi households need to have less cash savings because they can now borrow if they need to?\n\nI'd not even pretend to know, let alone insist, what is the correct explanation for household deposit savings falling in Bangladesh. But I do insist that which explanation is true matters enormously. Which model, which explanation, is the very heart of the whole subject of economics. Exactly what makes it so fun and so annoying in fact.\n\nTim Worstall is a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "opinion", "tokens": 776, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:34:18.373103"}

This is not to mention the political leaders’ fondness for high-sounding words and phrases, often accompanied by unrealistic or vague promises designed to captivate their audience.\n\nMost politicians generally shy away from dealing directly with economic issues, despite their relevance and practical implications, as such matters are often considered issues of “high thought,” supposedly beyond the grasp of common people.\n\nInstead, politicians tend to believe they are well-versed in their craft as full-time, unpaid professionals, though this is not always the case.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that political parties and leaders are compelled, particularly during elections, to make pledges aligned with popular demands for development. When choosing parties and candidates in parliamentary elections, voters sometimes prioritize economics over politics.\n\nFor them, “economics” means inflation, employment opportunities, local roads and physical infrastructure, education and healthcare services, social protection, and similar concerns.\n\nWill this be the case in Bangladesh’s upcoming parliamentary polls?\n\nIt is my conviction that politics and economics have, paradoxically, displaced each other, despite the critical importance of both for the next government to be elected shortly.\n\nThe Bangladesh economy has been devastated by corruption, mismanagement, and the oligarchic policies of Sheikh Hasina’s fascist regime. Democratic institutions were also undermined, depriving people of the opportunity to elect their leaders independently.\n\nNow that the country is once again preparing for elections, political parties and candidates are competing to make attractive promises related to economic policies and measures to be undertaken by the next government.\n\nIn doing so, however, the main contenders for power are inviting greater challenges for themselves. At the same time, the critical economic issues created under the Hasina regime, issues that may soon turn into full-blown crises, appear either to have escaped conventional political attention or to be deemed insufficiently attractive to sway voters.\n\nOtherwise, we might have seen concrete bailout programs, or at least serious discussions about them by now.\n\nThere is no clear estimate of how much money will be required to provide equitable opportunities for those deprived in recent years.\n\nWhich sectors will absorb more than two million new jobseekers annually? How will a universal healthcare system be ensured, quality education delivered to all, and liveable cities, towns, and villages created for a vast population?\n\nWe have little idea about the sources of revenue needed to channel Tk 500,000 crore to rescue banks and financial institutions plagued by defaulted loans and loan forgery. Is there any viable formula for servicing foreign debt that now exceeds $100 billion? Nobody knows whether the country will ever recover the billions of dollars siphoned abroad. Corruption has become a new normal in our lives, and an effective remedy is yet to be in our sight.\n\nIt is also clear that the government to be formed after the forthcoming elections will not enjoy the luxury of a “honeymoon period,” during which newly elected leaders are spared of harsh criticism.\n\nInstead, it will have to assess in advance the economic impact of its decisions and their political consequences, or demonstrate the courage to take politically difficult decisions in pursuit of economic goals.\n\nThe key crises facing Bangladesh’s economy today have arisen from immoral and illegitimate political decisions, actions, and maneuvers of the Hasina regime. This reality stands in stark contrast to Vladimir Lenin’s observation that “politics is the most concentrated form of economics.”\n\nIn Bangladesh’s case, the economic crisis has been a byproduct of repressive politics manifested in mass killings, enforced disappearances, attacks on the opposition, and the silencing of dissent. These policies were pursued to satisfy personal self-aggrandisement, to patronize goons and oligarchs, to install sycophants in key positions, and to serve India’s hegemonic interests in exchange for political support.\n\nThus we saw the consequences -- embezzlement of bank funds through loan forgery, plundering of public resources via large infrastructure projects, a heavy burden of foreign debt, looting of small investors’ money through stock market manipulation, extortion of ordinary citizens through fiscal and market interventions, and the implementation of discriminatory policies. All these have produced long-term negative political fallout that must be addressed by the next elected government, if democratic governance is to be restored.\n\nIn the 1970s, some global development planners described Bangladesh as a “test case of development,” implying that if this country could succeed, any nation could. The infamous characterization of Bangladesh as a “basket case” as attributed to Henry Kissinger nevertheless overshadowed an entire generation of policymakers.\n\nBangladesh has since proved such assessments both wrong-headed and heartless, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of challenges to life and livelihoods. Progress has largely been driven by the people themselves through individual effort and collective contribution often in spite of governance failures and political disruptions.\n\nWhen the country began reducing poverty at an accelerated pace, some commentators labelled this success a “development puzzle,” failing to anticipate obvious social and economic gains. This progress was most pronounced during periods of democratic governance, not under the autocratic regimes often mischaracterized as eras of growth. Political parties seeking electoral victory were therefore compelled to make economic pledges to woo the voters.\n\nHowever, after three consecutive rigged elections and the eventual fall of the Hasina regime, the conduct of a free and fair election has become the foremost national priority.\n\nVoting patterns may now change as political polarization has shifted following the collapse of one party, the now-banned Awami League, within what had long been a bipartisan system involving the BNP, despite decades of political rivalry. Also, the crisis the economy may face anytime soon, is actually the outcome of ill politics.\n\nThus, the next puzzle confronting Bangladesh is less about economics than about politics, given the ongoing transition. Why is this a political puzzle? Because, there are quite a few unknowns and invisible realities on the political front at present.\n\nEven ahead of the 12 February 2026 election, candidates may not fully grasp the preferences of female voters, the expectations of politically and economically marginalized groups, such as religious communities, the evolving outlook of the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s, or the demands of the new and first-time voters.\n\nThis is a historic turning point at which the identity of the election winner may matter less than the broader trajectory of Bangladesh’s politics.\n\nAs the aftershocks of the July 2024 revolution are yet to be fully felt, the country may see the beginning of the new politics some people talk about and dream of, after the elections.\n\nKhawaza Main Uddin is a journalist and writer.

In some countries, it slows services and breeds inefficiency; in others, it erodes institutions and, at its extreme, undermines entire states. Unchecked corruption damages both governance and public trust.\n\nIn Bangladesh, corruption remains a daily reality. From land administration and policing to utilities and licensing, bribery punctuates many citizen interactions with the state. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics’ 2025 Citizen Perception Survey found nearly one in three people paid bribes to access public services.\n\nBeyond individual transactions, corruption distorts policy implementation, weakens service delivery, discourages investment, and undermines confidence in the rule of law.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, debates over civil service pay take on heightened importance. Pay revisions are rarely seen as mere adjustments for living costs; they are signals of state capacity and intent. Higher salaries may attract skilled workers, reduce reliance on illegal income, and encourage professionalism. Economic theory offers cautious support: Better pay increases the costs of losing a job and may discourage misconduct.\n\nYet, these incentives depend on the surrounding institutions. In Bangladesh, weak enforcement, selective punishment, and extensive discretionary authority mean that higher wages alone are unlikely to deliver cleaner governance -- but they remain a critical piece of a broader reform puzzle.\n\nEvidence on whether higher public-sector pay reduces corruption is far from straightforward. Over the past 20 years, researchers have explored this link, and the results suggest it’s not a simple matter of “pay more, get less corruption.” The effects depend on a mix of factors.\n\nFor higher wages to really deter corrupt behaviour, officials need to believe they are likely to be caught, punished fairly, and have only limited discretion in their roles.\n\nIn Bangladesh, these conditions are often weak. Enforcement is patchy and sometimes seen as selective. Many government positions still give officials wide-ranging authority, and informal networks can erode accountability. In this environment, simply raising salaries may have only a modest impact.\n\nFor an official, the decision to engage in corruption comes down to weighing expected gains against expected risks -- and higher pay alone may not tip the balance.\n\nCross-country evidence offers a useful perspective: While better-paid bureaucracies are often observed in less corrupt countries, careful studies suggest that the direct effect of wages on corruption is typically modest. In low-income settings, even large increases in government pay relative to the private sector are associated with only small reductions in corrupt behavior.\n\nSome studies find improvements in administrative efficiency, such as shorter delays, without comparable changes in more serious forms of rent-seeking.\n\nMore detailed studies help explain these patterns. In Ghana, a major police pay reform in 2010 nearly doubled officers' incomes, yet both the frequency and size of bribes reportedly increased. In India, wage increases for customs officials in the late 1990s had little effect on bribery at ports.\n\nA particularly striking example comes from China, where repeated civil service pay increases over a decade raised official salaries to more than twice the GDP per capita. Yet corruption did not decline. Instead, the scale of corruption increased, with larger bribes and more high-level cases.\n\nBy contrast, Georgia's sharp reduction in police corruption in the mid-2000s followed pay increases that were embedded within sweeping institutional reforms that dismantled old networks and strengthened enforcement. Research on procurement in public hospitals in Buenos Aires shows that higher wages mattered little on their own. Corruption declined sharply only when monitoring improved.\n\nMonitoring itself, however, is not a cure-all. Oversight officials may also face corrupt incentives, and increased scrutiny can sometimes shift rather than eliminate rent-seeking. Even so, evidence suggests that raising the probability of detection can matter.\n\nIn an Indonesian experiment conducted by MIT economist Benjamin Olken on village road projects, villages informed that they would certainly be audited experienced corruption declines of about 30 percent. While audits did not always lead to punishment, the deterrent effect was, nonetheless, visible.\n\nThe implication is that wages tend to reinforce existing institutional strength rather than compensate for its absence. Paying public servants adequately can support efficiency and may contribute to reducing corruption, but only under particular institutional conditions.\n\nWages appear to work best as complements to enforcement and accountability, not as substitutes for them.\n\nRevising civil service pay may be justified on grounds of fairness, dignity, recruitment, and administrative efficiency. Whether it also leads to cleaner governance depends on factors that extend well beyond pay scales. Understanding those interactions is essential for informed public debate.\n\nBetter pay is welcome -- but without institutional reform, it will not deliver the clean governance that citizens rightly expect.\n\nMd Ahad Al Azad Munem and Samin Yasar Anabil are Research Associates at the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI), and can be reached at munemhere@gmail.com and saminyasaranabil@gmail.com.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "opinion", "tokens": 790, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:34:22.328584"}

So much snow fell during the first half of March in Stockholm that negotiating the icy roads became difficult, with piles of snow creating a white motif across the city. Orange weather alerts advised people to remain indoors unless travel was essential.\n\nSporting thick coats, hoods, and hats, I ventured out from the cosy warmth of my hotel room into the freezing conditions of Stockholm on one of those early March days to explore the city—particularly Gamla Stan, the colourful old town of the Swedish capital. The narrow, winding cobblestone streets, lined with buildings in varied hues, give Gamla Stan its distinctive character. It is home to the medieval Storkyrkan Cathedral and the Swedish Royal Palace—subjects I will probably write about in a separate episode.\n\nToday’s travelogue is dedicated to the beauty and elegance of the mute swans and ducks frolicking in the waterways near the Royal Palace. Winds blowing in from the archipelago stung my face, yet I stood mesmerized by the grace of a bevy of mute swans fluttering their white plumage in the Norrström River channel, a central waterway in Stockholm. Norrström, one of Europe’s shortest rivers, connects Sweden’s third-largest freshwater lake, Lake Mälaren, with the Baltic Sea.\n\nMute swans and ducks in Norrström, the river in central Stockholm, overlooking the Royal Palace and Swedish Parliament Building.Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nThis area is known for attracting large numbers of swans and other birds during the winter months. In the photographs, readers can see a bevy of swans and ducks gathered in the frigid water near a snow-covered bird-feeding station.\n\nThe city government has maintained a long tradition of feeding birds in this area every winter since 1955, ensuring they have access to food during the colder months when the water might otherwise freeze over. This practice has made the area a unique and popular spot for experiencing Stockholm’s winter cityscape alongside thriving birdlife.\n\nAs I walked past the Royal Palace and the Swedish Parliament House and stood by the stream, I noticed ducks and a bevy of mute swans in the water. Their plumage appeared remarkably white, soft, and silken. Swans maintain their feathers by spreading a special oily preen secretion, released from a gland at the base of their tails. This oil makes their feathers highly hydrophobic, allowing dirt and water to slide off easily. Their feathers also provide insulation, and they are often seen tucking their bills under their plumage to keep warm. Swans can be observed in the water while foraging, swimming, or tipping forward to reach underwater plants.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Stockholm, the Swedish King`s official residence - one of Europe`s largest palacesPhoto: Dhaka Tribune\n\nThere are six to eight known species of swans. The swans I saw near the Royal Palace waterways were of the mute swan variety. Curious about their name, I later learned that among swan species, mute swans are considered relatively quieter—though not truly “mute” in the literal sense. They are less vocal than other swans, hence the name. Despite this, they can make loud honks and snorts while flying.\n\nMute swans can also be highly aggressive when defending their nests and offspring, using their wings to strike perceived threats. They are capable of producing a hoarse, trumpet-like call to protect their territory. However, this sound does not carry as far as the calls of other swan species, which contributes to their “mute” designation.\n\nStanding by the bank of the channel, with ducks and mute swans foraging and frolicking in the water close by, the Baroque architecture of the Royal Palace’s eastern façade in the historic Gamla Stan remained visible in the distance. Amid the chilly Stockholm weather, a sudden break in the clouds allowed sunlight to peek through, bringing a welcome touch of warmth and making the moment even more enjoyable and memorable.\n\nThese birds are common and beloved in Stockholm, frequently seen in its lakes, fjords, and archipelago. They often use wind currents for swift travel and form close family groups, with young cygnets sometimes riding on their parents’ backs. These distinctive white swans, with their orange bills and black knobs, are native to Eurasia and are commonly found in lowland freshwater lakes, estuaries, bays, wetlands, and ponds across Europe and parts of Asia. In the Stockholm area, mute swans hold historical significance, having been protected by royal decree as early as the 17th century following intensive hunting during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe writer standing at bird feeding station in Stockholm.Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nThere are several species of swans, including the black swan, trumpeter swan, tundra swan, whooper swan, little swan, coscoroba swan, and mute swan. Swans are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae and rank among the largest flying birds in the world. The largest living species—such as the mute swan, trumpeter swan, and whooper swan—can grow over 1.5 metres in length and weigh more than 15 kilograms.

As humidity levels drop and cold, dry air replaces the familiar warmth, many people experience itching, flaking, cracked lips and worsening of existing skin conditions.\n\nFrom urban apartments in Dhaka to rural households in the north, winter skin problems are among the most common seasonal health complaints — yet they are often underestimated.\n\nBangladesh’s winter is short but sharp. During November to February, lower temperatures and reduced humidity weaken the skin’s natural moisture barrier. Frequent use of hot water, harsh soaps and indoor heaters further strip the skin of essential oils.\n\nChildren, the elderly and people with eczema or diabetes are particularly vulnerable.\n\nDermatologists say the most frequent winter complaints include:\n\nIn rural areas, exposure to cold air, dust and manual labour increases the risk of skin damage, while in cities, air pollution and air-conditioned environments add to the problem.\n\nExperts agree that regular moisturising is the single most important step in winter skin care. Thick, cream-based moisturisers work better than lotions, particularly for very dry skin.\n\nIngredients such as glycerin, ceramides, shea butter and petrolatum help lock in moisture.

One of my co-visitors, Zia Bhai, had already made his first few captures. With professional camera equipment and a powerful lens, he managed to take some beautiful photographs of red ghost crabs and hoopoes.\n\nRight from the shoreline, we could smell Sonadia’s famous dried fish being sun-dried in the open. There were stocks of dried fish (shutki) from many species, with Chhurimach (Ribbonfish), Shamudrik Chepa (Faissa), Baspata, and Chingri (shrimp) among the most in demand.\n\nSonadia is considered a hub of dried fish, where fish are preserved through sun-drying—a natural, chemical-free process—with markets in Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong, and beyond, across the country. Dried fish is a South Asian delicacy and a vital low-cost source of protein. However, hygiene remains a concern, as traditional sun-drying can expose fish to germs, pests, and pollution, and harmful pesticides are sometimes used.\n\nSonadia, a small island of about 9km² off the Cox’s Bazar coast, is part of Maheshkhali Upazila, located 15km northwest of the Cox’s Bazar district headquarters. Sonadia and Maheshkhali are separated by a waterway locally known as the Baddar Channel. Starting from Cox’s Bazar Jetty No-6, I stopped at Sonadia briefly before heading to Maheshkhali.\n\nWith its mangrove forests, diverse birdlife, red ghost crabs, marine turtles, and commercially important fish stocks, Sonadia is undoubtedly a biodiversity hotspot in Bangladesh and also acts as a natural shield against disasters. Its unique ecosystems clearly deserve better conservation.\n\nA Red Ghost Crab. Photo: Ziaur Rahman\n\nIn 1999, Sonadia was declared an Ecologically Critical Area (ECA) to protect the island’s biodiversity. However, later efforts to develop various infrastructures in the name of tourism parks severely compromised the ECA initiative. Fortunately, the government has recently revoked the park initiative.\n\nEven a short stay on Sonadia Island offers opportunities to spot birds such as sandpipers, plovers, herons, geese, and various waterfowl. Many migratory birds on long-distance flights also use Sonadia as a critical stopover.\n\nDuring our brief stay, we managed to spot several casts of red ghost crabs, a colourful hoopoe, and a sandpiper.\n\nWriter standing in front of fish sun dried at Sonadia Island. Photo: Ziaur Rahman\n\nRed ghost crabs are a vital part of Sonadia’s coastal ecosystem. Found crawling along sandy beaches, they are known for their long, stalked eyes and vibrant red coloration. Omnivorous by nature, they consume worms, small shellfish, fish, and detritus. Living in burrows dug into the sand, they are active both day and night, playing an important ecological role by aerating the sand and serving as prey for other animals.\n\nOne of my co-visitors, Ziaur Rahman, is a journalist specializing in stock market and economic analysis, as well as a wildlife photographer. As we admired the island’s natural endowments, Zia Bhai managed to capture an excellent shot of a stationary Eurasian Hoopoe on the ground.\n\nAn Eurasian Hoopoe. Photo: Ziaur Rahman\n\nIn our part of the world, hoopoes are also known as Mohonchura and Hudhud. Another common name, linked to Islamic tradition, is Suleiman Pakhi (Bird of Solomon), referring to its role as a messenger of Prophet Suleiman. It is a distinctive bird, with a tall, erectile crest, a cinnamon-coloured body, and black-and-white wings and tail.\n\nIn the Quran, the hoopoe is described as a messenger who brings crucial news about the Queen of Sheba to Prophet Suleiman. Across Arabic, Greek, and Persian cultures, the hoopoe appears as a mythological figure, often portrayed as a wise messenger or guide.\n\nA cast of Red Ghost Crabs.

Responding to this need is MMS Global Services, a study-abroad consultancy founded byMahmood Moosa Syed, which has steadily built a reputation for trust, honesty, and consistent student success.\n\nOver the years, MMS Global Services has positioned itself as a student-focused organization, helping applicants pursue higher education in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Sweden, and several European countries. What sets the firm apart, according to students and parents alike, is its clear communication, transparent processes, and realistic guidance throughout the application journey.\n\nMMS Global Services recently strengthened its approach by introducing a comprehensive “Study Abroad Roadmap”—a structured framework that guides students from initial assessment to post-arrival support. This model includes profile evaluation, course and university selection, documentation, visa preparation, pre-departure orientation, and career-focused guidance after arrival.\n\n“Many students fail not because they are unqualified, but because they receive incomplete or misleading information,” saidMahmood Moosa Syed, Founder of MMS Global Services. “We believe transparency is essential. Students deserve to know what is realistically achievable based on their profile, finances, and long-term goals.”\n\nAccording to the company, MMS Global Services maintains one of the highest student visa success rates in Bangladesh, a result it attributes to careful screening, honest counseling, and detailed documentation support. Rather than pushing students toward unsuitable destinations or institutions, consultants focus on aligning applications with genuine academic and financial readiness.\n\nThis approach has earned strong trust among students. Many describe the organization as honest, responsive, and supportive, particularly during critical stages such as SOP preparation, financial documentation, and visa interview readiness.\n\nA parent of a current international student shared that their child is now completing a master’s degree in Toronto, noting that MMS Global Services provided clear guidance at every step—from visa filing to accommodation planning—without hidden conditions or unrealistic promises.\n\nBeyond mainstream destinations, MMS Global Services has developed a strong footprint in Sweden and the United States, alongside several European countries—regions known for their strict visa scrutiny and detailed compliance requirements. The consultancy reports exceptionally high student visa success rates for Sweden and the USA, positioning it among the most trusted study-abroad consultancies in Bangladesh for these destinations.\n\nFor Sweden, where financial documentation and academic alignment play a critical role, MMS Global Services has earned a reputation for precise application handling and compliance-focused counseling. Similarly, for the United States, the firm provides in-depth guidance on university selection, SOP development, financial documentation, and visa interview preparation—areas where many applicants typically face challenges.\n\nStudents applying to European and US institutions receive destination-specific counseling, covering academic prerequisites, English proficiency standards, financial proof, visa interview readiness, and long-term career considerations. This structured and honest approach has helped many students secure successful outcomes in highly competitive education systems.\n\nWhile MMS Global Services operates from Bangladesh, its reach extends nationwide through online consultation and digital assessment services. Students can submit their profiles through the official website,mmsglobal.io, to receive free initial assessments and personalized guidance. The platform also publishes regular updates on admission timelines, document checklists, and scholarship opportunities.\n\nAs part of its digital expansion, MMS Global Services is currently working on a dedicated mobile application aimed at simplifying the study-abroad process for students. The upcoming app will allow users to track application progress, upload documents, receive real-time updates, and communicate directly with assigned counselors.\n\nAccording to the company, the app is being designed to improve transparency and accessibility, particularly for students outside major cities, ensuring they stay informed at every stage of their journey.\n\nTo further strengthen student support abroad, MMS Global Services is planning to introduce country-wise representatives in key destination countries. These representatives will assist students with local orientation, compliance guidance, and settlement-related challenges after arrival.\n\nFounder Mahmood Moosa Syed noted that this initiative aims to bridge the gap between admission and real-world adjustment. “Our responsibility doesn’t end with visa approval,” he said. “We want students to feel supported even after they reach their destination.”\n\nAs part of its future roadmap,MMS Global Servicesplans to organize study-abroad seminars across universities and colleges and launch a digital publication titled the “Global Scholarship Guide,” aimed at helping merit-based students better understand international funding opportunities.\n\nFor founder Mahmood Moosa Syed, the company’s long-term vision remains grounded in ethics and student success.\n\n“Studying abroad changes lives,” he said. “Our responsibility is to guide students honestly, transparently, and professionally—so they can build their future with confidence.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "feature", "tokens": 747, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:34:44.105733"}

Fortunately, those tensions were largely absorbed by our elders, not by us. Instead, I remember how we immersed ourselves in the writings of some of the great Soviet authors, which helped develop our mental faculties at a very formative age.\n\nI would collect magazines such as Soviet Nari, Soviet Desh, and Udayan from a neighbourhood library. They were a class apart—rich in stories, unforgettable illustrations, and striking photographs. Master storytellers Anton Chekhov and Lev Tolstoy were among our first after-school reads. Other greats such as Dostoevsky, Gogol, and Gorky—all towering figures in Russian literature—entered our lives gradually over time.\n\nFyodor Dostoevosky Monument. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nI was keen to find opportunities to connect with anything related to these literary giants, especially Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, during a visit to Moscow in late autumn 2014. One day, as I explored the city—on foot and by hopping on and off different subway lines—I ventured farther from my hotel, Novotel Moscow City, only to find myself standing in the shadow of a larger-than-life statue of Dostoevsky. I had not known that a prominent bronze statue of Fyodor Dostoevsky stood on Mokhovaya Street, and discovering it there was a moment of great joy for me.\n\nAs I walked past the area, I was admiring the grand building of the Russian State Library (formerly the Lenin Library) when, moments later, a bronze statue of Dostoevsky—seated on a bench in a contemplative pose, his hands resting on his lap—caught my eye. The statue was erected in 1997 as part of the city-wide celebrations marking Moscow’s 850th anniversary.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating part of my Moscow journey was visiting the former city residence of Lev Tolstoy, now preserved as the Lev Tolstoy Estate-Museum at Khamovniki. Khamovniki is a central district of Moscow, situated southwest of the city centre and south of the Arbat District, within a curve of the Moskva River.\n\nIn this photo Leo Tolstoy (centre, seated) is seen with his family members. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nLocated on a street now named after him, the house was purchased by Tolstoy in 1882 at the insistence of his wife, who wanted better schooling opportunities for their children in Moscow. It is said that after acquiring the house, Tolstoy spent every winter there until 1901, while continuing to spend his summers at his ancestral estate in Yasnaya Polyana, about 200 kilometres from Moscow. I wish I could also visit Yasnaya Polyana, now a museum as well—the place where Tolstoy wrote War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and where he is laid to rest.\n\nThe Tolstoy house I visited is a 19th-century estate featuring a beautiful wooden residential building, a courtyard garden, and a life-size statue of Tolstoy. By the time I collected my ticket and entered the estate-turned-museum, daylight was already fading under an overcast sky. It was late in the day, and there was likely little time left before closing. Thankfully, a kind attendant switched on the lights inside and ushered me into a warmly inviting space, filled with historic photographs and artefacts related to Tolstoy, his family, and his work.\n\nA room of the Tolstoy museum. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nTo me, the place felt deeply connected to the central theme of Anna Karenina—love. There was something profoundly moving about the Lev Tolstoy Estate-Museum in Moscow. One of its most remarkable aspects is that the interior has been restored to reflect how it looked during Tolstoy’s lifetime. I admired the rich displays of family photographs, sculptures, furniture, paintings, graphic works, and decorative art.\n\nMuseum staff told me that the estate houses more than 5,000 items belonging to the Tolstoy family. One photograph in particular struck me: Lev Tolstoy surrounded by his extended family, captured in a single frame. It was taken around 1900 by Karl Karlovich Bulla (also known as Carl Oswald Bulla), widely regarded as the father of Russian photojournalism.\n\nWriter with Tolstoy sculpture inside the museum. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nAs I took a few photographs of my own, I found myself absorbed in the thought that this was the very house where the great wordsmith penned works such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Resurrection, The Power of Darkness, What Is My Faith, and The Fruits of Enlightenment, among others.\n\nImage shows the 193rd birth anniversary of Tolstoy hosted by Russian House in Dhaka in 2021. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nDuring Tolstoy’s time, the Khamovniki house was one of the centres of cultural life in Moscow and Russia. It welcomed many distinguished guests, including the young Sergei Rachmaninov, who played the piano and once accompanied Chaliapin’s singing; the artist Ilya Repin, whose portrait of Tatyana, Tolstoy’s daughter, hangs in one of the rooms; and Maxim Gorky, who frequently visited and played chess with Tolstoy. Anton Chekhov also visited him here.\n\nLeo Tolstoy. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nWith its green courtyard and wooden structures, the museum feels like a quiet corner of rural charm in the heart of Moscow. Tolstoy’s Moscow estate carries an atmosphere that feels as though his spirit still lingers within its walls.\n\nI left the museum that autumn day with a deep sense of fulfilment, having seen up close the artefacts of a master storyteller whose works give voice to some of humanity’s deepest reflections. A meaningful life, lived authentically with love and compassion rather than an exclusive focus on career, status, and material possessions—is that not the central message of Tolstoy’s novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich, one of my personal favourites?\n\nWriter by the entry plaque of Tolstoy Museum.

The agreement was completed through an official Zoom meeting while the author was in the United States on a personal visit.\n\nPublishing officials confirmed that the contract features record-level author compensation, along with performance-based royalty structures designed to match the author’s proven sales record, steady reader demand, and established international distribution network.\n\nThe publishing agreement is widely seen as a result of the continued commercial success of RobinRafan’s earlier books, which together have sold more than 70,000 copies across multiple editions, demonstrating sustained reader engagement over time.\n\nThe titles have been presented and distributed through major international book fairs and publishing platforms in markets including Spain, Germany, Malaysia, and Singapore. At a time when traditional reading habits are declining globally, the books have maintained steady demand, a trend observers attribute to the author’s practical, application-focused approach to artificial intelligence, where complex tools are explained clearly and applied to real-world creative workflows, production efficiency, and long-term content sustainability.\n\nAlongside his publishing career, RobinRafan has built a strong international presence as an AI educator, with around 8,000 creators from various countries participating in his AI Masterclass programs focused on practical, production-oriented use of artificial intelligence. Industry observers note that his consistent book sales, large-scale educational reach, and international recognition have collectively positioned him as a prominent voice in AI-driven creative education. Under the agreement, Borshadupur will handle both print and digital publication of the forthcoming book for local and global markets, with clearly defined timelines, marketing coordination, and provisions for future editions.\n\nThe publishing agreement was concluded under the leadership of Mohammad Masfiqullah Tonmoy, Chief Executive Officer of Borshadupur, a third-generation publishing house with a continuous legacy dating back to 1975 through its affiliated imprint, Student Ways. The publisher stated that RobinRafan’s previous three books were all released under their imprint and achieved best-selling status, demonstrating consistent reader demand. This sustained commercial performance, according to Borshadupur, was a primary factor behind entering into a high-value agreement for the author’s fourth book, reflecting confidence in his proven sales record, long-term market relevance, and ongoing impact in AI-focused creative education.\n\nThe publisher further noted that the forthcoming book will center on practical applications of artificial intelligence for content creators, including workflow optimization, enhanced production quality, and the development of sustainable creative and earning systems. The decision to move forward with the project was based on the author’s documented publishing history, international educational reach, and professional standing in AI-based content creation.

Retailers have demanded a reduction to between 5–20%, aligning with global practices, asserting that the current rate still makes authorized phones prohibitively expensive and jeopardizes their ability to sell competitively.\n\nRetailers also want simplifications in import documentation and vendor registration.

My visit to Moscow’s Pushkin Museum some 11 winters ago remains fresh in my memory, with seminal works by Old Masters like Goya, Botticelli, Rembrandt, and Rubens leaving a lasting impression on me. The power of art lies in its ability to evoke strong emotions, transport us through time, and become indelible parts of our soul and memory.\n\nOctober weather in Moscow is distinctly autumnal, rapidly transitioning to early winter conditions by the end of the month. It is generally cool, damp, and marked by limited sunshine. I remember it was drizzling, and the weather felt unusually cold for a mid-October day in 2014. Wearing a full-sleeved black woollen sweater, I stood under an umbrella in a long queue after collecting my entry ticket to the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nA plaster cast of Michelangelo`s David at Italian Courtyard at Pushkin Museum.

As a plaster cast of Michelangelo’s David greeted me at the very first step inside one of the museum’s prized halls, I felt warmth—both literal and metaphorical. It is one of several renowned plaster casts of David, alongside those at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels. The David at Pushkin closely resembles the original Michelangelo masterpiece and is among the oldest casts, ordered and produced in an authentic Florentine workshop around the same time the Moscow museum itself was being constructed. Pushkin’s David continues to serve its original purpose: allowing students of fine arts to study the sculpture, while also remaining on display for inspection and admiration by millions of art connoisseurs each year.\n\nSome artifacts at Troy Gold section of Pushkin Museum.

Its glass roof ensures ample daylight in the first-floor galleries and the two atrium courtyards.\n\nRich in masterpieces by globally renowned artists—especially its extraordinary collection of French Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early 20th-century modernists such as Van Gogh, Cézanne, Renoir, Matisse, Picasso, Monet, and Gauguin—the Pushkin Museum ranks among the world’s top 50 most visited fine art galleries. Art connoisseurs can also admire works by Russian greats like Chagall and Kandinsky.\n\nA bronze work by Finnis sculptor Wäinö Valdemar Aaltonen. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nFounded in 1912, the museum is located in the historic centre of Moscow, not far from the Kremlin. As far as I can recall, it was also relatively close to Novotel Moscow City, where I was staying. I took the metro from Vystavochnaya station, almost next door to my hotel, visited the Kremlin, and then headed towards Kropotkinskaya station, from where it was just a few minutes’ walk to the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nThe museum possesses one of the world’s largest art collections, spanning from Ancient Egypt and Greece to modern times. Today, its holdings comprise around 7,00,000 works of art from different epochs. The jewel of the collection is French art of the 19th and 20th centuries—one of the most celebrated collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings in the world.\n\nThe main building houses artworks from various countries, covering periods from antiquity to the early 19th century. This includes an extensive collection of plaster casts of sculptures from antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, as well as original paintings, sculptures, graphics, and decorative arts.\n\nVenus after Bath, a bronze made sculpture by Bologna Giovanni, an Italian Rennaisaunce sculptor. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nOf particular interest are the ancient Egyptian collections, including Priam’s Treasure—a collection of 259 items comprising jewellery, vessels, hammer-axes, and artefacts fashioned from rock crystal, also referred to as “Trojan Gold.” The treasure was discovered by Heinrich Schliemann during excavations at the site of Troy between 1872 and 1890.\n\nThe Pushkin Museum also displays significant works by leading European artists such as Rubens, Rembrandt, Botticelli, El Greco, Poussin, and Watteau. Some 26 of the museum’s galleries are dedicated to a wide-ranging collection of works by master painters of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIt is impossible for anyone to thoroughly inspect all the fascinating paintings, sculptures, and artefacts that make up the Pushkin Museum’s rich treasure trove, though I tried to visit as many galleries as possible in a single afternoon.\n\nI was particularly fascinated by the gems from master painter Pablo Picasso, including some of his most notable works: Old Blind Man with Boy, The Two Acrobats, Portrait of Ambroise Vollard, and Woman with a Fan. One simply cannot resist spending time in silent reflection before the masterstrokes of legendary French visual artist Henri Matisse, renowned for his use of colour and original draughtsmanship.\n\nHarlequin and his Companion (Les deux saltimbanques - The Two Acrobats) by Pablo Picasso.

Created around 1816 as part of Goya’s Disparates series but published posthumously in 1864, Carnival depicts masked figures in chaotic, dreamlike revelry, reflecting societal absurdity and human irrationality through Goya’s signature blend of social commentary and dark fantasy.\n\nVisitors can also admire masterpieces such as Bacchanalia by Peter Paul Rubens, the most influential artist of the Flemish Baroque tradition. The bacchanalian theme refers to ancient Greco-Roman festivals honouring Bacchus (Dionysus), the god of wine, characterised by wild, ecstatic, and often drunken revelry, fertility rites, music, and dancing. Rubens painted several works depicting bacchanalian themes, but Bacchanalia (also known as Dionysian Rhapsody), dated around 1615 and housed in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow, remains the most famous among them.\n\nWriter at one of the Pushkin Museum galleries.

This is true even for a country like Bhutan, where nature is stunning, heritage is rich, and the public perception of prosperity is not confined to economic growth alone. Here, prosperity is less about gross domestic product (GDP) and more about gross national happiness (GNH).\n\nWhile GDP measures a nation’s economic output, GNH is a holistic alternative pioneered by Bhutan. It assesses overall well-being by incorporating psychological, environmental, cultural, and governance factors beyond mere financial indicators, aiming for sustainable and equitable development rather than pure economic growth. Essentially, GDP asks: “How much wealth are we making?” while GNH asks: “Are we living well, sustainably?”\n\nArtefacts at Simply Bhutan. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nIdeally located in the heart of the national capital, Thimphu, Simply Bhutan is a highly interactive living museum that offers an immersive introduction to traditional Bhutanese life. A visit to Simply Bhutan can serve as a rewarding prelude for tourists, offering a glimpse of what to expect from this landlocked Himalayan kingdom—the “Land of the Thunder Dragon”—its deep-rooted Buddhist culture, dramatic landscapes of monasteries and fortresses, and its commitment to GNH by balancing tradition with modernity.\n\nDuring my business trip to Thimphu earlier this year, when the cool February breeze was pleasant and the Bhutanese sky wore an unusually vivid blue, I stepped into Simply Bhutan one afternoon and was greeted with a shot of ara (rice wine). A guided experience allowed me to explore various cultural aspects firsthand—from dressing in traditional Bhutanese attire and learning how ara is distilled, to being introduced to dragon masks of different denominations, traditional kitchen utensils, culinary practices, and even dancing to the tunes of Bhutanese folk songs sung by local artists.\n\nDance to the tune of a greeting song at Simply Bhutan. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nAs a novice, I also tried my hand at archery and khuru (a local dart game), observed the construction techniques of traditional Bhutanese houses, and learned how Bhutanese preserve dried chili peppers—a major component of their cuisine. Near the museum entrance, artists performed a welcoming song accompanied by a dance choreographed to depict the process of rice distillation used to make high-quality ara.\n\nFurther inside the museum, a wide array of artefacts is on display, allowing visitors to witness and admire the artisan skills of the Bhutanese people, particularly the intricate woodwork seen in traditional kitchen utensils.\n\nTraditional Bhutanese kitchen utencils at Simply Bhutan.

The museum’s architecture reflects traditional Bhutanese design, featuring repurposed timber, doors, window frames, and other materials salvaged from demolished houses. This sustainable approach ensures that Bhutan’s architectural heritage remains alive for future generations.\n\nLater, I enjoyed performances of traditional songs and dances that have been passed down through generations and are now performed by young Bhutanese artists with remarkable skill and eloquence. They also encouraged visitors to participate in a few dance steps, which were simple yet graceful.\n\nArtefacts at Simply Bhutan. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nOnce the dance and musical performances concluded, I was offered a traditional Bhutanese dinner. It was sumptuous and deeply satisfying, to say the least. While Bhutanese cuisine bears influences from neighbouring countries such as India, China, and Nepal, its defining hallmark is spiciness, with chilies at the heart of nearly every dish.\n\nA Bhutanese meal. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nDatsi—a locally available cheese with a texture and taste similar to feta, but without the salt—is used abundantly in many dishes. The Bhutanese diet is rich in meat, poultry, grains, and vegetables. Both dried and fresh chilies are used generously, either to spice up stew-like curries or as the main ingredient, usually accompanied by steamed rice, the primary source of carbohydrates. My personal favourite is red rice, valued for its nutritious qualities, delicate texture, and nutty, earthy flavour—especially when served with tender chicken pieces stir-fried with bell peppers.\n\nDried chillies at Simply Bhutan. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nWhen I first noticed rows of dried chili peppers hanging along the sidewalls inside the Simply Bhutan museum, I could already imagine how central chilies must be to Bhutanese cuisine. Later, I discovered that chilies are almost a staple in many Bhutanese delicacies. Central to Bhutanese cuisine, the humble chili—known locally as ema—is not merely a spice but a defining feature of the nation’s gastronomic identity.\n\nVisitors in traditional Bhutanese dress at Simply Bhutan.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/tech/399175/apple%E2%80%99s-new-mie-security-feature-worth-your-peace", "title": "Apple’s new MIE security feature worth your peace of mind?", "body": "Apple released their new iPhone 17 series a few months ago, but aside from the new features and improvements, the most exciting security feature of these new phones was not even mentioned in its keynote or really advertised at all.\n\nAnd I think it significantly raises the bar in terms of security for everyone.\n\nWith Apple’s new A19 chip being based on the ARMv9A architecture, iOS now supports the memory tagging extension feature. And this comes from an announcement on the Apple security research blog in September.\n\nApple calls their implementation “Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) and published a technical breakdown on their security blog.\n\nIt combines some existing memory safety features in iOS with ARM's Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), which has been seen in some Android smartphones for a few years now.\n\nLet’s explore how it aims to make cyberattacks on iOS devices significantly more difficult.\n\nMTE is a hardware feature introduced by ARM as part of the ARMv8.5-A architecture in 2019. ARM built it as a debugging tool for software developers.\n\nApps need to store data in your phone's memory (RAM), and they reserve this space through a process called memory allocation.\n\nUnfortunately, if these allocations are not strictly validated, apps can inadvertently or maliciously access memory outside of what they were assigned.\n\nWhat MTE does is essentially tag every single memory allocation with a secret code.\n\nThe hardware then ensures that every future request to access that memory is only granted if the request contains that same secret.\n\nIf the request does not contain the secret code, for example, because it came from an app other than the one that was allocated in the first place, then the app that is making the request crashes and the event is logged by the operating system.\n\nThe goal behind this was to help developers identify these fatal errors immediately. Why is this a big deal for security?\n\nAccording to reports from both Microsoft and Google, over 70% of security vulnerabilities identified in their products are attributable to issues related to memory safety.\n\nAnd many of the high-profile vulnerabilities that we have seen over the years were caused by a lack of memory safety.\n\nSecurity researchers identified that MTE could function as a continuous tool for monitoring and preventing security exploits, in addition to its use as a debugging tool.\n\nThe Google Pixel has actually been using MTE in some capacity since the Pixel 8.\n\nMost exploits against iOS devices rely on memory corruption bugs. These are bugs where, because of faulty system logic, an attacker can write to out-of-bounds memory or type-confuse objects to corrupt important parts of the process data and ultimately take control of the system.\n\nMemory corruption bugs have been around forever and are unlikely to go away completely. Even with the latest iOS versions, we see many bugs of this category being fixed in patch updates regularly.\n\nIt would be infeasible to aim for a bug-free iOS. So instead, Apple has focused on making these bugs as difficult as possible to exploit.\n\nThey have already done a great job at this in their software and hardware enhancements over the years, with features like pointer authentication codes to mitigate control flow hijacking, zone sequestering, and other proprietary hardware mitigations like Kernel Text Read and Write (KTRR) and Page Protection Layer (PPL).\n\nApple's MIE is supposed to be the final nail in the coffin, potentially ending memory corruption exploitation in iOS completely.\n\nApple uses MIE to secure the kernel and over 70 userland processes in its operating system.\n\nThey also make MIE available as an opt-in feature for app developers, meaning that it is very likely the apps you use, which need the highest levels of security, hopefully as instant messengers or web browsers, will probably enable it on their own soon.\n\nThis usage is a step above the typical MTE configuration on Android, which uses it less substantially across the operating system itself.\n\nIt works much like an address sanitizer, a common software debugging tool.\n\nThe problem with software-based address sanitizers is that they have a significant overhead due to the inefficiency of performing extra logic on every single memory access. It would not be a good idea to ship a production device with a software-based address sanitizer active because performance would take too much of a hit.\n\nThe cool thing about the MTE feature is that it leverages new hardware instructions available in the ARMV9A architecture that implement the functionality of a software address sanitizer, but in a hardware-backed way.\n\nThese new CPUs have built-in circuitry to handle the sanity checks. So, performance takes no real hit.\n\nIf you inspect the kernel itself on the iPhone 17 running the latest iOS version, you can see these new MTE instructions present in the kernel cache binary.\n\nThe first new instruction you will see is the IRG instruction, which inserts a random tag into a pointer.\n\nNow, much like pointer authentication codes, the IRG instruction generates a random 4-bit tag and inserts it into the top, unused bits of a given pointer.\n\nThe STG instruction takes that tag and writes it into a special private shadow memory region that holds tags for every 16-byte chunk of memory.\n\nOnce a pointer and its corresponding memory are tagged, any subsequently executed memory access instruction will trigger an exception if the tags are ever found to be mismatched.\n\nChecking for mismatched tags does not require any new logic to be implemented in software. The typical ARM 64 load and store instructions have new circuitry hard-coded in these latest ARM CPUs, which validates the pointer and memory tags almost instantly with no noticeable performance overhead.\n\nSo, in practice, how would this prevent exploitation? For typical use after freeing bugs, a program mistakenly uses a pointer to already freed memory.\n\nBut with MIE enabled, as soon as a memory access is made, the ARM hardware will recognize the tag mismatch and trigger an exception. Similarly, for buffer overflows, the very first out-of-bounds write will fail due to the address and memory tag mismatch.\n\nOne small caveat is that since these memory tags are only four bits, separate allocations can have the same tag, but this still provides a strong defence since the reliability of an exploit will drop to a 1 in 16 chance of success.\n\nProtection vs performance\n\nWith all that power built into the hardware, you are probably wondering, why is MIE not enabled everywhere on iOS. It comes down to a choice between protection and performance, which are defined by the two modes in which MTE operates.\n\nMTE comes in two modes, synchronous and asynchronous.\n\nSynchronous mode is optimized for protection over performance, and it is the only mode the Android open-source project claims can act as a true security mitigation.\n\nAsynchronous mode offers higher performance but does not necessarily crash the application immediately, and it does not record some information about the memory that is being improperly accessed.\n\nIf you look at how MTE is used in GrapheneOS, for example, they enable MTE on the kernel in synchronous mode.\n\nBut for userland apps, they use a hybrid approach where they use synchronous mode when apps are writing to memory, but they use asynchronous mode when apps are reading from memory.\n\nAnd the Android open-source project refers to this as asymmetric mode. They claim that this provides a balance, but it is still not as robust as purely operating in synchronous mode.\n\niOS, on the other hand, uses synchronous mode exclusively in all the areas where it uses MIE.\n\nAccording to Apple, in asynchronous mode, memory corruption does not instantly trigger an exception, which may result in a period during which exploitation is possible.\n\nEven though Apple has made synchronous MTE more efficient thanks to the new hardware, the performance impact of enabling it is why they have enabled it selectively.\n\nMTE also makes existing memory safety bugs much more visible to users. The likelihood that an existing bug causes an app crash increases when MTE is enabled.\n\nFor this reason, many would probably be unlikely to put up with broadly enabled MTE across the entire system right now.\n\nBut hopefully, this becomes less of an issue over time as developers improve their apps thanks to this new debugging ability.\n\nWhy this new feature matters\n\nGetting back to cybersecurity on mobile devices, all of this is of particular relevance to people who are being targeted by mercenary spyware like Pegasus.\n\nAttackers rarely use a single exploit; they chain many smaller exploits together.\n\nIf an attacker gains even a limited access through a vulnerable application, they can leverage that privilege to compromise additional applications, potentially reaching the highest levels of your operating system.\n\nSince the majority of problems are memory-related, many of the links in these chains are memory corruption bugs—bugs which could potentially be stopped by MTE.\n\nAs Apple puts it, \"inevitably, attackers must face memory integrity enforcement at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving very few viable avenues for exploitation.\" Breaking just one step invalidates the entire attack strategy.\n\nThe protections MIE gives against malware and spyware that rely on these exploit chains are enormous because they dramatically reduce the probability of a successful chain of attacks.\n\nOn Apple's own research blog, they state that they believe memory integrity enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems and that even with substantial effort, their internal research team could not rebuild any of their sample exploit chains to work around this mitigation on iOS.\n\nAs an iPhone user, this should be a very comforting statement, and for the hacker community, it presents a daunting challenge.\n\nMIE vs. Lockdown Mode\n\nSo, how does this compare to lockdown mode?\n\nLockdown mode is very effective at preventing exploit chains, just like MTE is. But the approach that it takes is very different.\n\nUltimately, what lockdown mode is doing is reducing your attack surface dramatically by disabling apps and features that you are unlikely to need in the name of security.\n\nIf there were an exploit in the iMessage link preview generator, it could now be blocked by MIE, and it would happen without needing to disable link previews because MIE is always enabled.\n\nIf MIE blocks an exploit attack, it is detected immediately. MIE crashes the exploited app and logs the details, making it more likely you will receive a threat notification quickly.\n\nIf an exploit is blocked simply because you didn’t use link previews, that could be harder to spot after the fact.\n\nFor the highest levels of security, these features should be working in tandem.\n\nThat is the basics of defence in depth to dramatically reduce the likelihood of an exploit.\n\nI hope Apple soon introduces a feature that lets Lockdown Mode enable MTE system-wide for both the OS and apps.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, MTE is only enabled selectively outside the kernel on iOS for both performance and stability reasons.\n\nLockdown Mode users are far more likely to accept app crashes and performance drawbacks for improved security. If they added per-app toggles like GrapheneOS, where you could decide which apps this gets enabled on or not, that would be even better for these advanced users with very high-risk threat models.\n\nThis is a massive leap forward in terms of security for iPhone users, and frankly, it is the first time in a long while that I have been genuinely thrilled about an Apple product.\n\nWhile MTE is a hardware feature that is exclusive to the iPhone 17 series, some of the other improvements that Apple includes in MIE are implemented in iOS 26, and they will be accessible to older devices.\n\nThe other thing is that most casual users aren't exploited by Pegasus. However, the likelihood that you could face a threat like mercenary or commercial spyware should not be understated.\n\nIf your work puts a target on your back—MIE is not a feature; it is an insurance policy that considerably raises the bar on your personal security posture.\n\nTake a moment to breathe on that. Your digital safety just got a massive upgrade.\n\nThe writer is a contributor and a tech enthusiast.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "feature", "tokens": 2035, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:35:00.639700"}

The socket is the physical slot where your CPU goes.\n\nThis is your primary filter when narrowing down motherboard options.\n\nRight now, AMD gives you two main choices, and one is the clear winner for your money.\n\nAs AM6 approaches, AM5 remains the current-generation standard. It supports all the fastest Ryzen CPUs like the 7000, 8000, and 9000 series, along with DDR5 memory, providing higher bandwidth and lower latency for demanding workloads.\n\nThe motherboard and DDR5 RAM initially cost more. At Computex 2024, AMD announced support for the platform until 2027 and beyond.\n\nThis means any AM5 motherboard you purchase now will still be relevant for future AMD CPU launches, without the need to buy a new motherboard. You pay more now, save later.\n\nAM4 is the budget champion. Supports older, but still great, CPUs like the Ryzen 5000 series and still cheaper DDR4 RAM. AM4 is a legacy platform—still capable but nearing its sunset.\n\nBut, if you buy AM4 today, you will have to replace the entire motherboard (and RAM!) the next time you want a major CPU upgrade.\n\nOnly choose this if your budget is absolutely hit rock bottom.\n\nIf you can stretch the budget for one component, make it an AM5 motherboard. It’s the gatekeeper to all future performance.\n\nRule 2: Selecting the right chipset\n\nThe chipset is the motherboard’s control centre.\n\nThis is what enables advanced features like blazing-fast SSD, CPU overclocking, and high-speed connectivity. While all AM5 chipsets share the same powerful foundation, they differ in how much “infrastructure” they offer—from PCIe lanes to USB bandwidth.\n\nAnd here is the truth: paying more does not always mean you get the best deal.\n\nYou are choosing between three main types; each tailored for a different kind of user.\n\nOnce you understand what each tier unlocks, the decision becomes surprisingly simple.\n\nX-Series: Luxury overkill\n\nThis is the neighbourhood where prices start to make your eyes water. You only need to be here if your PC is your full-time job or your identity.\n\nAt the top, you have the X870E and X670E, the “Maxed Out” Elite. These dual-chipset boards deliver everything: the highest port count, multiple USB 4.0 connections, and massive bandwidth.\n\nThese boards have the most robust, highest-phase-count VRMs to support extreme overclocking and the highest-end CPUs under sustained load.\n\nIf you are planning to run everything at ultra-pro-max—and you have the budget to match—this is your playground. But for 99% of people, it’s overkill.\n\nJust below that sit the X870 and X670, the “Prosumer” class. They offer nearly all the bells and whistles of their “E” counterparts, with slightly reduced connectivity.\n\nThese boards are ideal for high-end gamers and content creators who want serious overclocking headroom and more than just a couple of fast ports.\n\nB-Series: King of the hill\n\nThe B-Series chipset tier delivers the speed and features you can actually feel. It is the chipset that balances performance, price, and future-readiness like no other.\n\nAt the centre is the B850 chipset, the new benchmark for mainstream excellence.\n\nIt offers all the essentials: CPU overclocking for manual tuning, PCIe 5.0 lanes for your GPU and M.2 SSDs, and a generous spread of USB ports.\n\nIt lets you build a powerful, future-proof PC at a truly reasonable price. And the money you save can go toward a better GPU, cooler, or PSU.\n\nMeanwhile, the B650 and B650E represent the previous generation’s crown.\n\nThe B650E guarantees PCIe 5.0 for your GPU slot, while the regular B650 is still capable—but the B650 chipset has reached its end of life.\n\nThey are similar to the B850 in many ways but often lack newer I/O standards like Wi-Fi 7 or consistent 20Gbps USB ports.\n\nThe B650 chipset will be discontinued in the market once existing inventory from motherboard manufacturers is sold.\n\nBottom line? If you find a great deal on a B650 board, it is still a solid pick. But for a new build, the B850 is the smarter choice, especially with Zen 5 support baked in.\n\nB840 & A620: Basics Only\n\nIf your goal is simply to build the cheapest PC that powers on, this is where you land. But be prepared to sacrifice key features.\n\nB840 and A620 are entry-level chipsets designed for bare-minimum functionality.\n\nYou lose CPU overclocking, and more critically, you miss out on PCIe 5.0 speeds—both for your GPU and your primary SSD slot. Fast USB ports? Also absent.\n\nThese boards are only worth considering if you are building a basic office PC, a computer for a student, where price is the only factor.\n\nFor serious gaming (do not fall for any scam) or productivity, steer clear.\n\nYou will hit performance roadblocks in no time, and upgrading later will likely mean replacing the entire system.\n\nRule 3: Don't skimp on the essential features\n\nOnce you have chosen your chipset, the next step is to examine the motherboard’s individual features.\n\nThis is where the real difference between an average build and a great one begins to emerge.\n\nPower, Stability, and Cooling:Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs) act as precision power converters, transforming the 12V from your power supply into the ultra-low voltage (typically between 1.0 and 1.4 volts) required by your CPU cores, all while managing intense current demands.\n\nThe effectiveness of VRM depends on two key factors: phase count and amperage rating.\n\nPhase count determines how evenly electrical load and heat are distributed across the board. More phases generally mean better thermal balance and improved stability under load.\n\nAmperage rating, on the other hand, reflects the quality of the individual components—the higher the rating, the more power each phase can handle before overheating. That is why always check both phase count and amperage together.\n\nThe quality and phase count of the VRMs are directly related to the chipset tier. X870E/ X670E boards have 18+ phases of the highest quality (up to 110A per stage) to handle unlocked high-core CPUs under extreme stress.\n\nIn contrast, entry-level boards like the A620 come with minimal VRM, which limits their ability to support sustained high-performance tasks.\n\nAlso note that VRMs generate significant heat, and without proper cooling, performance suffers. It is the difference between peak performance and silent throttling.\n\nBeyond power delivery, a well-designed BIOS makes it easy to tune RAM profiles, adjust fan curves, and troubleshoot issues.\n\nOnboard diagnostic LEDs (CPU, DRAM, VGA, BOOT) are invaluable—they pinpoint issues instantly if your system fails to boot.\n\nThese small features save hours of guesswork and frustration and make a big difference in user experience.\n\nExpansion, connectivity, and audio:When evaluating a motherboard, start with the PCIe expansion slots—they house your GPU and other expansion cards.\n\nThe chipset determines how many PCIe lanes you get and what generation they support (like PCIe 4.0 vs. 5.0), which directly impacts bandwidth.\n\nMemory compatibility is equally crucial: check whether the board supports DDR4 or DDR5, and what speeds it can handle.\n\nBuying high-frequency RAM is pointless if your motherboard’s memory controller can’t keep up—especially with AMD’s EXPO profiles, where tighter tuning can unlock real-world gains.\n\nRear I/O and internal headers shape your daily experience: how many USB ports do you need? Do you need USB-C for fast charging or high-speed data? Are there enough fan headers for your cooling setup?\n\nFinally, do not overlook onboard audio.\n\nWhile discrete sound cards exist, a premium onboard chip like the Realtek ALC1220P or 4080—paired with shielded circuitry and quality capacitors—can deliver clean, immersive sound without interference.\n\nLong-term value & support:Build quality matters more than most people realize. A solid motherboard with a thick PCB and reinforced PCIe slots is less likely to bend or crack, especially when supporting heavy GPUs.\n\nPremium features like onboard power/reset buttons and metal shielding not only enhance durability but also make the build more satisfying.\n\nBeyond hardware, the vendor’s ecosystem plays a crucial role.\n\nReliable brands like Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, and ASRock offer stable BIOS updates, functional control software for RGB and fan tuning, and dependable driver support.\n\nGood customer support is priceless when something goes wrong.So do not just chase the lowest price—consider long-term value.\n\nA slightly more expensive board with better VRMs and a newer chipset could save you from costly upgrades or a full rebuild down the line.\n\nAre We Paying “Asus Tax”\n\nNow, let's talk about the motherboard market of Bangladesh.\n\nYou have got to ask yourself: am I buying a motherboard, or a logo? This is where the story gets really interesting, and honestly, a little frustrating.\n\nTake the two titans of the industry, MSI and Asus, for example.\n\nBoth brands offer motherboards with nearly identical core specs and VRM designs. Yet, time and again, the Asus boards typically demand a premium over their MSI counterparts.\n\nTake the mid-range sweet spot, for example, from the house of MSI: MAG B850M MORTAR and MAG B850 Tomahawk Max, versus from the house of Asus: ROG Strix B850-G and ROG Strix B850-A.\n\nAll these boards run the B850 chipset and offer almost similar specs.\n\nBut if you compare apples to apples, you will see both MSI boards come with a Realtek (8126-VB) 5G LAN and full-bandwidth Wi-Fi 7 (320MHz) offer double the wireless throughput (up to 5.8Gbps!) and faster wired performance compared to Asus’s older Intel 2.5G LAN and halved Wi-Fi 7 bandwidth.\n\nWhich industry reports often cite the Realtek 5G chip as providing better stability and fewer driver issues than the Intel 2.5G version—a critical factor for long-term reliability. Yet, you are paying 5,000 taka more for the Asus Strix (38,500 vs 33,500).\n\nRemember, LAN is not just about the internet—it is your internal expressway for file transfers, backups, media streaming, and real-time collaboration.\n\nLook at the display output: the MSI boards support HDMI 2.1 FLR, capable of pushing 8K at 60Hz. Asus boards, by contrast, top out at 4K at 60Hz via HDMI 2.1. Asus appears to be limiting bandwidth on this tier.\n\nOn the overclocking front, the ATX models illustrate the point perfectly.\n\nThe MSI Tomahawk Max has a better theoretical maximum memory speed of 8400 MT/s (OC) compared to the Asus Strix B850-A's 8000 MT/s (OC).\n\nBoth have virtually identical high-end VRMs (14+2+1 vs. 14+2+2, both 80A SPS), but MSI is still 4,500 Taka cheaper (38,500 vs. 43,000).\n\nThat saved 4,500–5,000 Taka is not just sitting in your wallet—it’s buying you an essential upgrade: a faster SSD, a better CPU cooler, a more reliable PSU, or even a nice dinner out.\n\nSo, ask yourself again: is your build driving the brand, or is the brand driving your build?\n\nMSI is doing something incredible: delivering premium design with aesthetics, rock-solid boards with feature sets without forcing you to pay a brand tax.\n\nI am not saying go get every MSI and ditch Asus. I am just telling you, do your need assessment, choose your chipset, compare the board specifications, look at the price tag and then make your investment decision.\n\nA fanboy attitude will not earn you anything, but a smart choice will surely do.\n\nFocus on these three rules, and you will walk away with a motherboard that is smarter, more reliable, and a far better long-term deal.\n\nYour future self (and your wallet) will thank you for being a wise buyer.\n\nThe writer is a contributor and a tech enthusiast.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "feature", "tokens": 1976, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:35:02.764695"}

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/lifestyle/397645/cracked-heels-in-winter-causes-care-and-remedies", "title": "Cracked heels in winter: causes, care and remedies", "body": "With winter comes a common yet often uncomfortable problem for many — cracked heels. The condition may start with mild roughness, but in severe cases, cracks can deepen, sometimes causing bleeding. The pain while walking, loss of appearance, and risk of infection make cracked heels more than a cosmetic concern; they are a genuine health issue. With a little care and regular maintenance, however, cracked heels can be effectively managed.\n\nThe primary cause of cracked heels is excessive dryness of the skin. Cold, dry winter air, insufficient water intake, wearing open sandals, prolonged exposure to water, frequent use of soap, vitamin deficiencies, and conditions such as diabetes can all increase the risk. Often, the skin on the feet becomes so dry and thick that the pressure from walking causes it to split.\n\nThe first and most crucial step toward relief is regular foot care. Soaking the feet in lukewarm water for 10–15 minutes every night helps soften the skin. Adding a little salt or liquid soap can enhance the effect. After soaking, gently remove dead skin with a pumice stone or foot file — lightly, not harshly — then pat the feet dry.\n\nMoisturizing is the next essential step. Apply a good-quality moisturizer, glycerine, petroleum jelly, or foot cream thoroughly, especially on cracked areas. Wearing cotton socks afterwards allows the cream to work overnight. Regular care over a few days can significantly reduce cracking.\n\nSeveral natural remedies also provide relief. Massaging pure coconut or mustard oil into the feet nightly reduces dryness. Honey acts as a natural moisturizer; applying it to the heels for 20 minutes before rinsing helps soften the skin. A scrub made from rice flour, honey, and a little milk can be used once or twice a week to remove dead skin. Aloe vera gel is another effective natural treatment.\n\nCaring for the skin internally is as important as external treatment. Drinking sufficient water daily helps prevent dryness, and a diet rich in vitamins A, C, E, and zinc — including carrots, oranges, lemons, nuts, leafy vegetables, and eggs — supports healthy skin. For people with diabetes, maintaining proper blood sugar levels is crucial, as cracked heels can become infected more easily.\n\nA few precautions can help prevent cracked heels. Avoid wearing very hard or open sandals for long periods. Apply moisturizer after bathing or before bed. Also, avoid soaking the feet in excessively hot water for too long, as this can worsen dryness.\n\nIf cracks become deep, cause bleeding, severe pain, pus, or show any signs of infection, it is safer to consult a specialist rather than rely solely on home remedies. Without timely care, even simple cracked heels can lead to complications.\n\nWith awareness, regular care, and healthy habits, this painful winter problem can be managed easily.

(For comparison, Y- Combinator takes over 100 startups per batch.)By securing a place at HF0, Tasbin and Farhan join a select fraternity of technical founders deep-diving into the next frontier of AI innovation. The team already got direct resources and advice from top companies like OpenAI, Midjourney etc.The journey of Markopolo AI is a testament to the power of resilience and vision. From their roots in Dhaka, Tasbin and Farhan have successfully scaled a product that is now recognized by the world’s most discerning investors and founders. Both founders are determined to make “Made in Bangladesh” software a reality to the whole world.The HF0 acceptance validates this ambition: in a landscape where most high-tech startups are based in Silicon Valley or major Western hubs, Markopolo AI stands out as a first ever Bangladeshi startup scaling at world-class pace. The founders’ selection into HF0 signals not just recognition but a bridge between local roots and global horizons.Markopolo AI’s new AI Revenue Agent aims to solve e-commerce’s biggest problem: customer disconnect. For two decades, marketers have called it personalization when they merely insert a customer’s name into an email: the famous “Hi {FirstName}” approach. Markopolo challenges this idea entirely.The new product is designed to move beyond simple automation to deep intelligence, capable of understanding a billion humans as individuals. Instead of sending a generic message to \"Hi Sarah,\" the AI Revenue Agent sees and communicates with \"Hi Sarah-who-browses-at-lunch-compares-prices-and-buys-on-mobile-after-reading-reviews.\"True personalization, Markopolo argues, means understanding the customer’s unique journey, the hesitation at checkout, the channel they prefer, their communication rhythm.Markopolo’s mission is simple yet ambitious: in five years, every e-commerce transaction will be guided by an AI revenue agent. And merchants will soon have to choose between adopting a sophisticated AI agent like theirs or struggling to build their own.Markopolo is already three years ahead of the competition.

His main goal was to create a secure system that doesn’t rely on the cloud. Unlike popular password managers such as Bitwarden or LastPass, EnigmaKeep stores all credentials directly on the user’s device, keeping them safe from online breaches and server leaks.\n\nThe software uses AES-256-GCM encryption and PBKDF2 key derivation with 600,000 iterations, providing the same level of protection used by major financial institutions. It also includes biometric authentication for fingerprint and Face ID login and functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA), making it accessible on any device without needing an internet connection.\n\n“I wanted to create something that gives people complete control over their data,” said HM Alvee. “Most password managers depend on cloud storage, but privacy should never require trust in a third party.”\n\nHe added, “EnigmaKeep is built to be fully offline so users can have total confidence that their information stays only with them. That’s what true digital privacy means.”\n\nThese features make EnigmaKeep a powerful option for individuals and professionals who value security but prefer not to depend on cloud services or paid subscriptions.\n\nEnigmaKeep is completely free and open-source, released under the MIT License on GitHub. This transparency allows developers around the world to inspect, audit, and contribute to the project.\n\n“Cybersecurity should be available to everyone,” said Alvee. “You shouldn’t have to pay a company or rely on a server to keep your passwords safe. Open-source projects like EnigmaKeep prove that privacy and accessibility can go hand in hand.”\n\nAlvee’s success highlights the growing influence of Bangladeshi innovators in international technology. His work on EnigmaKeep reflects a growing movement toward privacy-first software, at a time when data protection has become a global concern.\n\nProfessors and peers in the US have praised the project for its ethical approach and technical quality, describing it as an example of how cybersecurity tools should be built — secure, transparent, and user-controlled.\n\n“Winning the hackathon was an incredible moment,” Alvee said. “It showed that meaningful innovation can come from anywhere, and that Bangladeshi students can compete globally in technology and cybersecurity.”\n\nEnigmaKeep is a zero-knowledge, offline password manager that secures user data through advanced encryption and biometric access. It runs on all major devices, functions entirely offline, and supports importing and exporting data from leading password management platforms.\n\nWebsite: https://enigmakeep.com\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/hmalvee/EnigmaKeep", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "entertainment", "tokens": 460, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:35:24.234739"}

More than two centuries ago, when the educated population in the subcontinent was very limited, the Bangla newspaper was born. Its journey began with courage, a confident outlook, and ideals. Which serves as an inspiration forall Bangla newspapertoday.\n\nAround 1818, under the patronage of Raja Rammohan Roy and edited by Gangakishore Bhattacharya, the first Bangla newspaper, \"Bengal Gazette,\" started its journey. According to Brajendranath Bandyopadhyay, it was first published between 14th May and 9th July, and its existence can be found in the writings of Bhawanicharan Banerjee, Ishwar Chandra Gupta, and others. The newspaper was published for a year, but no printed or handwritten copy of it has been found.\n\nOn 23rd May 1818, the newspaper 'Samachar Darpan' was published from the Serampore Missionary Center in West Bengal. Many experts and researchers recognize it as the first Bangla language newspaper. John Clark Marshman was the editor of the newspaper. On 25 December 1841, Samachar Darpan was closed forever.\n\nAfter this start, some other Bangla newspapers were published quickly. In 1822, the conservative Hindu community newspaper \"Samachar Chandrika\" was published; its editor was Bhuvanmohan Mukherjee. In 1829, \"Sambad Bhaskar,\" representing social reformist and secular thought, was published. In 1843, the newspaper \"Tattvabodhini\" was published; its editor was Debendranath Tagore.\n\nAt this time, setting up a printing press and making printing letters was a big challenge in Bangla. Printing technology in Bangla script was established through William Carey and the Serampore Mission. This made the publication and distribution of newspapers easier.\n\nThe first newspaper in Bangladesh (then East Bengal) was 'Dharmattav,' published in 1848 from Dhaka, a monthly newspaper. According to many historians, it was the first significant printed publication published in East Bengal. However, it was a religious newspaper. However, the first Bangla language newspaper published in this region for the purpose of publishing regular news was \"Dhaka Prakash,\" published in 1861; its publisher was Radharman Ghosh.\n\nIn present-day Bangladesh, or in the former East Pakistan in 1971, several powerful newspapers were established, the most notable of which were Dainik Azad (published in Dhaka: 1948), Dainik Ittefaq (first issue: 1949), and Dainik Sangbad (published in 1951).\n\nAfter Bangladesh gained independence through the Great Liberation War in 1971, several notable newspapers were Dainik Bangla, Dainik Ittefaq, Dainik Sangbad, Dainik Janapada, Ganakanth, Sangbadpatra, etc.\n\nSince the 90s, several other popular and reputable newspapers have been established in Bangladesh, including Prothom Alo, Janakantha, Kaler Kantha, Jugantor, etc. All these newspapers have initiated a new trend of investigative journalism.\n\nCurrently, newspapers in this digital age have gone beyond printed paper and reached the reader's mobile screen through the Internet; these are called online news portals, which are basically the modern version of newspapers. The first online news portal of Bangladesh, bdnews24.com, started its journey in 2005. Apart from this, there are several other popular online news portals in Bangladesh at present.\n\nThe history of Bangla newspapers is not only the history of news reporting; it is the history of our identity, protest, reform, and change. Newspapers, this entire journey, starting from the Bengal Gazette to today's mobile screen, are the holders and carriers of our language, culture, and consciousness.

Through his innovative demand-based production model, known as the 70/30 Production Model, he is tackling waste management in the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector while ensuring premium fashion at affordable prices.\n\nToday, Live Shopping has gained momentum, with nine outlets across Bangladesh and a fast home delivery network nationwide. His production model ensures that fabric waste is minimized, costs are reduced, and workers are treated fairly, making it a groundbreaking shift in the country’s fashion industry.\n\nAt the core of this transformation is the 70/30 Production Model, a method that optimizes raw materials and production efficiency. Instead of mass-producing garments without demand, Live Shopping starts with 70% of the available raw materials, keeping 30% in reserve. As demand grows, another 70% is produced from the remaining stock, while 30% is again set aside. This cycle continues, ensuring that materials are never wasted, production costs remain low, and inventory is efficiently managed.\n\nThis smart waste management system has allowed Live Shopping to offer high-quality products at unmatched prices. One of its most popular offerings, a premium blazer set, starts at just 2,800 BDT, a price rarely seen for such quality.\n\nBeyond affordability, the cost savings from waste reduction have also enabled Live Shopping to offer better wages and working conditions for employees. This ethical approach sets a new benchmark for Bangladesh’s fashion industry, proving that sustainability can benefit both businesses and workers alike.\n\nHowever, Ashik Khan's impact extends beyond his brand. As an adjunct faculty member at a reputed private university in Bangladesh he has taught the 70/30 Production Model to over 500 students.\"Sustainability isn’t just about reducing waste; it’s about building a responsible fashion ecosystem. With our 70/30 Production Model, we’re making premium fashion accessible while ensuring fair treatment of workers and efficient resource management,\" said Ashik Khan.\n\nFrom being a software engineer to leading a sustainable fashion revolution, Ashik Khan’s journey is a testament to how innovation, adaptability, and determination can reshape an industry. With a growing number of outlets, an expanding customer base, and a strong commitment to educating future entrepreneurs, Live Shopping is at the forefront of a new era in Bangladesh’s fashion industry.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/lifestyle/396026/is-our-kitchen-making-us-sick", "title": "Is our kitchen making us sick?", "body": "We often think foodborne illnesses come from unhygienic street food or expired food items. But a recent study in Dhaka tells a far closer, more surprising story—the real danger might be right inside our kitchens.\n\nImagine stepping into a typical Dhaka home and inspecting daily kitchen utensils. A recent microbiological test of 100 households revealed shocking results: more than 90% of dish sponges and 81% of bar soap cups were contaminated with E. coli and coliform bacteria. Cutting boards, knives, refrigerator handles, and even stove knobs harbored harmful bacteria. In some cases, these surfaces were as risky as a toilet door handle.\n\nThis is not simply a local issue. Globally, research demonstrates a similar pattern: 89% of kitchen towels contain coliform germs, with 25% testing positive for E coli. Sinks, sponges, and dishcloths left damp become perfect breeding grounds for Salmonella and Listeria. Microbiologists insist that simple changes such as washing hands carefully, keeping raw and cooked foods separate, sanitizing surfaces, and avoiding rinsing raw meat can dramatically reduce risk.\n\nOne of the most surprising findings was about bar soap used for dishwashing. When left in wet soap holders with food residue, bar soaps become a bacterial swamp. Using the same bar soap to wash multiple items can cause cross-contamination, and leftover soap residues on plates and utensils pose further microbial and chemical risks.\n\nOn the other hand, liquid dishwashing solutions are sealed, completely hygienic, and easy to rinse off. They also work much better in rural areas, where hard water, rich in minerals like calcium and magnesium, makes cleaning more difficult.\n\nThe danger isn’t limited to dishes and sponges. Vegetables, fish, and meat from local wet markets often carry pesticide residues, heavy metals, and bacterial contamination. Without proper cleaning at home, these hazards end up directly on our plates, posing a long-term health risk.\n\nDr Latiful Bari, an eminent food microbiologist and safety researcher at the University of Dhaka, stated: “Presence of harmful Bacteria on vegetables in Bangladesh is a serious concern, yet most studies focus only on pesticides or chemicals. Our research shows harmful bacterial contamination in vegetables, kitchens, on sponges, and dishwashing utensils should equally be a matter of grave concern. The Regulatory Authority / NGO must raise awareness about kitchen bacterial contamination and cleanliness procedures to improve food safety.\"\n\nSo, is our kitchen making us sick? The evidence suggests it could be. The remedy, however, is simple and inexpensive: adopt smarter, safer habits. Replace sponges frequently, switch from bar soap to liquid dish soap, keep surfaces dry, clean refrigerators and utensils on a regular basis, and store food properly.\n\nIn a country where the kitchen is the heart of the home, it must also serve as the first line of defense for health. Kitchen hygiene is not a luxury; it’s a public health necessity. A few minor improvements today could protect many families from preventable diseases tomorrow.\n\nChowdhury Naim Ahmed Mujibis a consultant at an NGO in Bangladesh.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 492, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:04.259173"}

Photo: Collected\n\nThere’s a growing resale market for high-end or discontinued scents, and popular perfumes often increase in value over time.\n\nBut for most collectors, the price is justified by the joy.\n\n“Each bottle is a little world I get to visit,” says Tasnuva Azad, another collector.\n\nAlso, if you have unused or partially used perfumes, communities are ideal for buying, selling or trading.\n\nThey help you refresh your collection while finding new favorites as budget alternatives.\n\nAlways verify authenticity and condition before making a deal for a smooth experience.\n\nInstagram, Reddit forums and YouTube reviewers have transformed perfume collecting from a solitary activity into a lively global conversation.\n\nOnline fragrance reviewers, often called “fragheads,” have cult-like followings.\n\nCollectors share “shelfies” (photos of their collections), unbox new finds, review scents and even swap rare samples.\n\nTheir detailed breakdowns and storytelling abilities often influence a collector’s decision as much as the scent itself.\n\nWhat draws someone into perfume collecting?\n\nFor many, it starts with a memory – a scent worn by a loved one long ago.\n\nScent is one of the strongest triggers of memory, and collectors often describe their shelves as libraries of emotion – each bottle holding stories, places and people.\n\nFinding the right fragrance. Photo: Collected\n\nBut collecting isn’t just about memory.\n\nIt’s the skill and creativity behind making perfume that excites them.\n\nAnd then there’s the packaging, beautiful bottles, crystal caps and heritage designs – that often make a perfume look like a piece of art to display.\n\nSometimes the rarity of limited-edition releases creates an addictive mix of art and alchemy.\n\nPerfume collecting is evolving, now driven by sustainability, personalization and emotion.\n\nFrom refillable bottles to custom scents, it’s no longer just about owning fragrances, but curating memories and identity, one note at a time.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 566, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:10.277708"}

These are often stronger than mists at first but fade faster.\n\nUnderstanding fragrance notes is very important while choosing the scent.\n\nEvery fragrance has three layers.\n\nTop notes: The initial burst you smell when you first spray.\n\nMiddle notes (heart): They develop after a few minutes. These are the soul of the fragrance—often fruity, floral or spicy.\n\nBase notes: The scent that lingers. Think woods, musks or vanilla-warm and deep.\n\nFinding the right fragrance. Photo: Collected\n\nLongevity is about how long the fragrance lasts on your skin.\n\nSillage tells about how far your scent travels, like does it stay close or leave a trail?\n\nParfum (extrait de parfum) has the highest fragrance oil concentration at 20–30%, lasting 8 to 12 hours or more.\n\nEau de parfum (EDP) has 15–20% and stays for 6 to 8 hours, making it a popular daily choice.\n\nEau de toilette (EDT) is lighter at 5–15%, lasting 3 to 5 hours. It is great for daytime.\n\nEau de cologne (EDC), with 2–5%, lasts 2 to 3 hours and is often fresh and citrusy.\n\nThe lightest is eau fraîche with just 1–3%, lasting 1 to 2 hours, perfect for a quick refresh.\n\nPerfumes have the highest longevity, but many mists and body sprays can last longer if layered correctly.\n\nTry pairing a matching lotion or oil underneath.\n\nFragrances are often grouped into families based on their scent profile. Recognizing which you naturally gravitate toward can narrow down your options.\n\nFloral scents are romantic and feminine, featuring notes like rose, jasmine or peony.\n\nFresh or citrus fragrances feel clean and energizing, with hints of lemon, bergamot or green tea.\n\nWoody perfumes are warm and earthy, built around cedar, sandalwood or patchouli.\n\nOriental scents are rich and spicy, blending amber, vanilla or cinnamon.\n\nLastly, gourmand fragrances evoke sweetness and comfort with edible notes like caramel, coffee or chocolate.\n\nPay attention to what you’re drawn to when smelling others or testing on yourself.\n\nPerfume oils are alcohol-free and contain a high percentage of pure fragrance, usually between 20–40%.\n\nThey tend to last longer on the skin and offer a softer, more personal scent experience.\n\nBecause they don’t evaporate quickly, the fragrance unfolds slowly and stays close to the skin, making them ideal for all-day wear.\n\nFinding the right fragrance. Photo: Collected\n\nPerfumes react differently depending on your body chemistry. What smells amazing on someone else may not work the same way on you.\n\nAlways spray on your wrist or inner elbow and wait 15–20 minutes before making a decision.\n\nAvoid testing more than three scents at once, as your nose will get overwhelmed.\n\nTo choose wisely, don’t rely on the first whiff.\n\nLet the fragrance settle and see how it evolves on your skin.\n\nEach scent has its place in your routine.\n\nPerfumes for special occasions or lasting impact, mists for day-to-day freshness and sprays for gym bags or on-the-go.\n\nFor humid climates or hot days, lighter mists or sprays work better. In winter, stronger perfumes tend to last longer and feel comforting.\n\nIn the end, the perfect scent is one that makes you feel like yourself or a version of you that you love.\n\nTrendy perfumes come and go, but the right scent is the one that truly reflects your personality.\n\nWhether it’s a luxurious designer perfume or a budget-friendly body spray, it should lift your mood, spark a memory or boost your confidence.\n\nSo take your time, explore and let your nose lead the way.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 696, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:12.270949"}

People return home to be with their loved ones. Like every year, at least 25 million people will have traveled to different parts of the country on the occasion of Eid.\n\nEid ul Fitr is an Arabic word, meaning happiness or festivity, which originates from the Arabic word “Aud” and Fitr, translating to the breaking or conclusion of fasting.\n\nEid-ul-Fitr means the festival of fast-breaking, which will return after a year.\n\nEid-ul-Fitr is celebrated on the first day of Shawaal, the tenth month in the Muslim calendar, to mark the end of a month-long fast during the month of Ramadan.\n\nAccording to a Hadith attributed to Anas ibn Malik, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the two festivals of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Azha were instituted by the Prophet after his journey from Mecca to Medina.\n\nThe importance of Eid-ul-Fitr is purely spiritual. It is the day when Muslims thank Allah for giving them the will, the strength, and the endurance to fast and obey his commandment during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nEid is supposed to purify us physically, mentally, and spiritually while we look inside ourselves and reflect and give back to the community. It is also meant to eliminate the feeling of hatred among us.\n\nOnly if this happens will our celebration of Eid be considered successful.\n\nHistorically, it has been seen that despite the crowds in trains and buses and the disruption of schedules, the unquenchable joy of the people has not faded. Everyone is filled with joy and happiness in celebrating Eid.\n\nEid is undoubtedly the biggest religious festival in Bangladesh. It creates an atmosphere of unity and harmony in all walks of life through the exchange of joy and greetings between individuals. Rich, poor, high, and low, everyone participates in the joy and festivities of Eid with their families and relatives as much as they can.\n\nJust as we practice self-restraint in the teachings of fasting in Ramadan, we must also practice social responsibility during Eid. The flow of greetings, harmony, and cordiality that is present in the atmosphere during Eid festival increases the joy of the individual many times over, and a portion of personal joy is transformed into the vastness of social joy.\n\nIn Bangladesh, a lot of harshness, selfishness, and bad behavior has been developing over the years. Instead of human values, brutality is also seen in personal and professional life. Instead of thinking about the welfare of people, some people are engaging in bribery, corruption, adulteration, and price gouging. Some people are displaying brutality like murder, rape, and violence against women and children.\n\nOne must consider the real message of Ramadan and Eid. It carries the message of friendship, harmony, and joy at the end of Ramadan, giving us an opportunity for self-realization. It encourages us to understand social responsibility as human beings.\n\nAs a result, instead of excessive excess of personal joy and enjoyment during the Eid festival, it is everyone's duty in the existing context to be as humane and considerate as possible. It is everyone's duty to understand the suffering of the oppressed, distressed, and neglected people in society. Because festivals and joy are meaningful and successful only when they can bring smiles to everyone's faces.\n\nGreatness lies in being able to be happy and joyful with everyone. Nothing can be greater than eradicating the fear, panic, and despair among all and spreading the unbridled fruits of harmony and joy.\n\nOn the occasion of Eid celebrations, a large number of people from the capital and other big cities go to their villages. May their Eid journey be smooth and comfortable.\n\nIt is our duty to ensure that everyone can enjoy the joy of Eid equally. May the world be free from all forms of violence, hatred, and strife.\n\nMay the horrors of religious extremism and terrorism be eradicated. May the bonds of inter-religious harmony and brotherhood be strengthened. May the coming days be beautiful and adorned with beauty. May every soul be filled with laughter, happiness, and the joy of Eid. May an atmosphere of moderation, brotherhood, and harmony prevail in individual, family, society, and national life—this is the sincere wish of the Eid festival.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 723, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:16.123567"}

Wrapped in colorful envelopes and adorned with shimmering calligraphy, Eid cards were once the tangible embodiment of warmth in an era where emotions traveled by hand, not by pixels.\n\nThere was something magical about selecting the perfect Eid card. Stationery shops in Bangladesh, particularly in places like Nilkhet, New Market, Eraki Maath and various roadside stalls, fields, would gleam with an array of beautifully crafted cards, each adorned with intricate patterns, crescent moons and golden embellishments. Some cards had featured photos of our favorite cartoon characters, Barbie princesses, heroes, heroines and popular figures from sports, among others. Prices varied based on design and quality—simpler cards were available for as low as Tk5 to 10, while premium ones with embossing, glitter and pop-up elements could cost up to Tk50 or more.\n\nThe excitement of flipping through them, feeling their texture and choosing one that best expressed emotions was a cherished ritual. Some bore poetic verses, while others held simple yet profound words—each a reflection of the sender’s affection.\n\nSometimes, we even took the time to craft Eid cards ourselves. With colorful paper, sketch pens and a sprinkle of creativity, we poured our hearts into handmade cards. A carefully drawn crescent moon, a heartfelt message in our own handwriting and a personal touch made these creations even more special. The joy of making and receiving a handmade card was unparalleled, reflecting the effort and sincerity of the giver.\n\nBut with the dawn of the digital era, Eid cards faded into the background, replaced by instant messages and virtual greetings. Eid cards started to vanish in the early 2000s, as mobile phones and the internet became more accessible. The touch of embossed paper, the scent of fresh ink and the anticipation of tearing open an envelope have been lost to the swiftness of screens. Today, people mostly send Eid Mubarak messages via WhatsApp, Facebook and other digital platforms, making the once-essential Eid card a rare relic of the past. When a card arrived, it was treasured like a keepsake, slipped between book pages or tucked into memory boxes to be revisited in quiet moments of reminiscence. For those who cherished this tradition, some still keep old Eid cards stored as tokens of memory, preserving the emotions attached to handwritten wishes and intricate designs.\n\nUnlike fleeting digital messages, Eid cards held permanence. The journey of these cards was one of patience and anticipation, as they traveled across cities, sometimes even borders, to reach the hands of loved ones. The joy of receiving a card was unparalleled, its weight in hand symbolizing the sender’s effort and sincerity, making distances feel shorter and hearts grow fonder. Handing it over to our loved ones was also a delightful experience.\n\nYet, for those who remember, the memory of Eid cards lingers like an old melody, a reminder of a time when emotions were penned down with love, not typed in haste. Perhaps, in reviving this lost tradition, we can rediscover the joy of heartfelt expressions—where wishes are not merely sent but felt, where greetings are not just received but held close, just like in the golden days of Eid cards.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 560, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:18.094817"}

These joyous occasions mark moments of unity, gratitude, and celebration with loved ones.\n\nFrom attending the early morning Eid prayers to relishing grand feasts, the festive spirit is evident in every home.\n\nAmong the various cherished customs of Eid, one tradition stands out across generations—giving and receiving salami.\n\nAs a child, one of the most exciting moments for me was waking up early on Eid, getting dressed in new clothes, and rushing to my dadi (grandmother) to receive salami from her.\n\nThis was always the first stop before eagerly collecting salami from my parents and relatives. My cousins and I followed this ritual religiously on every Eid, cherishing the joy it brought us.\n\nEven now, as an adult, I still eagerly await salami—not for the money itself, but for the love and blessings it represents.\n\nCultural significance of salami\n\nThe tradition of salami has deep cultural roots in Muslim communities.\n\nThe act of giving salami is more than just a monetary exchange; it serves as a token of appreciation and a thoughtful gift.\n\nIt is a symbol of warmth from elders, and a beautiful reminder of the joy that has been passed down through generations\n\nHistorically, salami has been a way to teach children the concept of generosity.\n\nJust as they receive during childhood, they later grow up to give, continuing the cycle of kindness.\n\nShift from receiving to giving\n\nReceiving salami on Eid is a timeless tradition, deeply woven into the celebration. Children eagerly await their father’s return from the mosque after the Eid prayer, bowing down and touching his feet as a sign of respect before receiving their salami.\n\nThough this practice has faded in some families over the years, it has not disappeared entirely.\n\nWhile some continue to uphold the tradition, others have adapted it to modern expressions of respect.\n\nAs I grew up collecting salami and stepped into adulthood, the time came for me to take on a new role—the transition from receiving to giving salami.\n\nThere is a unique joy in handing over salami and witnessing the excitement on the faces of younger family members.\n\nSpirit of generosity and unity\n\nBeyond salami, Eid is synonymous with acts of giving. Charity, or zakat, is a fundamental part of Eid-ul-Fitr, ensuring that the less fortunate can also partake in the celebrations.\n\nFamilies prepare lavish meals and invite neighbors and friends, strengthening the bonds of community.\n\nEid-ul-Azha, on the other hand, emphasizes sacrifice and sharing, where meat from the sacrificed animal is distributed among the poor, relatives, and friends.\n\nThese acts of generosity highlight the core values of Eid—kindness, sharing, and gratitude.\n\nPreserving the tradition\n\nAs times change, traditions evolve, but the essence of salami remains a beloved part of Eid.\n\nWhether given in cash, through a bank transfer, or as a thoughtful gift, it is a gesture of love that transcends generations.\n\nWhat makes salami special is the emotions tied to it—the anticipation, the exchange of blessings, and the continuity of a heartwarming practice.\n\nWhether you are a child eagerly waiting for salami or an adult happily passing it on, the tradition brings a unique joy that makes Eid even more memorable.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 538, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:20.124488"}

Digital messaging cannot compare to the feeling of writing greetings on your own handmade Eid cards and telling your friends \"Eid Mubarak\". In the current era of social media, the traditional custom of distributing Eid cards has been lost.\n\nI remember that I used to start making Eid cards three to four days before Eid. Sometimes I would use watercolors, crayons, or cut out glossy paper to make these Eid cards. I would try to make cards that were more beautiful than my friends'.\n\nOn the morning of Eid, these cards were exchanged among friends. Which doubled the joy of Eid.\n\nAfter a few years, these Eid cards started being sold in various shops. These shops were available in cities, neighborhoods, and even villages. Many boys and girls would make Eid cards themselves and set up shops to sell them. After staying up all night to make Eid cards and selling them in the afternoon to get the money, the joy of Eid seemed to double.\n\nThen came the Eid cards printed in the press. These Eid cards would have \"Eid Mubarak\" written in large letters with greetings. There would also be natural scenes, birds, mosque domes, pictures of Makkah Sharif, etc. On the cards, there would be a commemorative moon and star on the domed mosque. Or \"Eid Mubarak\" written in the middle of a bouquet of red roses.\n\nWith Eid in sight, there was a booming business in cities and villages everywhere.\n\nAfter that, the popularity of handmade Eid cards gradually stopped. Now, school and college boys and girls no longer come in groups to buy Eid cards for friends and relatives like before.\n\nHowever, although the trend of exchanging Eid cards at the individual level has decreased, the popularity of group-based Eid cards has increased. Starting from government and private institutions, various organizations are now using Eid cards to express their wishes.\n\nThen, the touch of technology came to Eid greetings. SMS and MMS took over the place of Eid cards. We used to try to write greetings as beautifully as possible. I would type these greetings on my button mobile phone. Then I would send them one by one to my friends' mobile numbers. Different greetings would also come from my friends' numbers. The joy that came from taking the time to think about writing SMS greetings is now not available in anything else.\n\nThis tendency to write SMS with difficulty also decreased to a large extent later. Smartphones and social media came along. Most people now fulfill their obligations by sending greetings on Facebook, Messenger, email, e-cards, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and WhatsApp. These social media are being used as an alternative means of greetings instead of cards made with difficulty by hand.\n\nCurrently, more than a hundred online card-making websites have been developed for Eid cards. When you go to these websites, you can see thousands of Eid card samples.\n\nYou can choose the card of your choice from these samples and add your own design to it to create an Eid card. There are also separate websites for sending status or greeting messages on social media. You can easily copy the message of your choice from these websites and send it to your friends.\n\nShopkeepers said that earlier, Eid cards could not be sold from the beginning of Ramadan. Each shop sold one to five lakh taka of Eid cards every day. Everyone used to wait for this time. Now, a handful of organizations order a small number of cards.

It was the same way his father must have handed him one, decades ago.\n\nGrowing up, the tupi never felt like a necessity to me. I saw it as an accessory, something optional, something that didn't quite fit into my idea of personal style. My elders wore it with an effortless grace, as though it was a part of them, but I struggled to understand why it held such importance.\n\nYet, on that particular morning, standing before my father, watching him smooth out the creases in his own tupi, I saw something I hadn't noticed before—a quiet reverence, a silent ritual of continuity.\n\nThe tupi or a prayer cap—is an understated yet significant part of Eid attire for many Muslim men. For some, it completes their panjabi, a final touch to the ensemble worn for prayers. For others, it holds deeper meaning—cultural, religious, and familial.\n\nIt is a symbol of modesty, an unspoken declaration of faith, and in many ways, a bridge between generations.\n\nIn the days leading up to Eid, the markets are alive with vendors calling out to customers, their stalls stacked with tupis of every variety—embroidered, crocheted, plain, colorful, imported, locally made.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the classic white cotton tupi remains the most popular, a staple in many households. Yet, others opt for ornate designs, intricate patterns.\n\nBut beyond the bustling commerce of these markets lies a quieter, more personal tale.\n\nI remember seeing my grandfather’s tupi as a child, a soft, worn-out piece of cloth that had lost its original shape. It had been washed so many times that its white had turned an almost ivory shade. But to him, it was never something to replace. It held memories of countless prayers, of Eid mornings spent side by side with loved ones who were no longer here.\n\nWhen I think about it now, I realize that for him, that tupi was not just a tradition—it was a reminder. A piece of the past, held close.\n\nYet, not everyone wears a tupi with ease. As a child, I often felt it was an imposition, something insisted upon by elders, something I wore out of respect rather than conviction. I would see young boys at the Eid prayer, their tupis slightly oversized, constantly adjusting them, as if trying to find comfort in something they had yet to fully understand. Perhaps they, like me, would grow into it—not just in size, but in meaning.\n\nComing back to the morning of last Eid-ul-Fitr, as I stood in the vast expanse of the Eid prayer, surrounded by hundreds of men—some with pristine white caps, others with worn and fraying ones—I understood something: the tupi is not about uniformity, nor is it merely about religious conformity. It is a symbol of standing shoulder to shoulder with a community that stretches across generations.\n\nA man to my left adjusted his son’s tupi, making sure it sat properly on his head. The boy, no older than five or six, fidgeted impatiently, not yet aware of the significance of this moment. And yet, years from now, perhaps he too will recall this morning—the touch of his father’s hands fixing his cap, the sea of white before him, the collective murmur of takbirs filling the air.\n\nTradition has a way of finding us, even when we do not seek it. Some embrace it willingly; others take time to understand its weight. But certain things—like a tupi passed from father to son—carry stories too precious to be left behind.\n\nThis Eid, as I once again pick up my tupi, I do so not out of obligation, but out of understanding.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "lifestyle", "tokens": 632, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:24.094663"}

One of the components of this happiness is new clothes. Rich, poor, and middle-class people try to wear new clothes as much as possible on the day of Eid-ul-Fitr. And in any family, children have priority when it comes to new clothes. All parents try to give their children the clothes they like the most.\n\nOn the day of Eid, the turn of wearing new clothes begins with going to prayer in the morning. Then, walking around in new clothes all day. However, with the development of technology, there has been a change in the way people hide or go overboard with Eid clothes.\n\nThere was a time when people tried to hide new clothes before Eid. The custom was that if someone outside the house sees the clothes before Eid, then they will become old. That is, people will see the Eid clothes on the day of Eid.\n\nAlthough children were ahead in this competition of hiding Eid clothes, adults were not far behind. Even among adults, there was a tendency to hide new clothes from friends and relatives until Eid. It was not uncommon for children to burst into tears if someone saw the new clothes before Eid!\n\nIt is quite difficult for others to experience or express this “secret joy” except for those who have had the experience of hiding these clothes.\n\nHowever, over time, our lifestyles have changed. This has also affected Eid clothes. It can be said that a kind of “show-off” competition has started. This show-off tendency is especially seen on social media. Who bought how many expensive shoes, clothes, jewelry? What is whose Eid budget, who bought how many clothes? We have a negative obsession with seeking self-satisfaction through publicity.\n\nIf anyone has the ability, they can spend more, buy more clothes. There is nothing wrong with that. But I call this “negative” in the sense that; your friends, colleagues or relatives may not have the ability that you have. This “show-off” of yours may be causing her emotional pain without her knowing it. Maybe her child is making a demand on you; which she cannot afford to meet. As a result, it is becoming painful for her and her family.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that you should not show your ability to people. But at the same time, you should also remember that it should not go to the extreme. Your joy should not be the cause of other people's secret pain.

An undersized AC will struggle to cool your space, while an oversized unit can lead to unnecessary energy consumption and higher electricity bills. In Bangladesh’s sweltering summers, choosing the correct AC capacity ensures optimal comfort, efficiency, and cost savings. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you make the best choice.\n\nThe cooling capacity of an air conditioner is measured in British Thermal Units (BTU). Simply put, BTU indicates how much heat the AC can remove from a room in one hour. The higher the BTU, the more powerful the AC. For instance, an AC with 5,000 BTU is suitable for small spaces like compact bedrooms, while a unit with 12,000 BTU or more is ideal for larger rooms or open-plan areas.\n\nIn Bangladesh’s intense heatwaves, understanding BTU is essential. An undersized AC will run continuously without effectively cooling, while an oversized unit will cool too quickly, leaving the room humid and uncomfortable. To avoid these issues, it’s crucial to calculate the exact BTU requirement for your space. To help you with that, theStar Tech AC Ton Calculatorwill come in handy. This user-friendly application considers factors like room size, insulation, and environmental conditions to recommend the ideal AC capacity.\n\nThe first step in choosing the right AC capacity is measuring the area of the room you want to cool. Start by calculating the square footage of the space by multiplying its length and width. Once you have this figure, you can estimate the required BTU based on general guidelines. For example, a small bedroom measuring 10 feet by 15 feet (150 square feet) typically requires an AC with 5,000–6,000 BTU. A slightly larger bedroom or study room, around 200–250 square feet, would need an AC with 7,000–8,000 BTU, while living rooms or combined spaces spanning 350–550 square feet may require units with 12,000–14,000 BTU or higher.\n\nHowever, these figures are just starting points. Several factors can influence the required BTU. For instance, high ceilings can trap more heat, necessitating a higher-capacity AC. Similarly, poorly insulated walls or large windows can increase the cooling load, requiring additional BTU. Open-plan spaces, such as combined living and dining areas, often demand a more powerful AC to ensure even cooling throughout. By carefully assessing your room size and layout, you can narrow down the range of AC capacities that will work best for your needs.\n\nThe purpose of the room affects the required AC capacity. Bedrooms, typically smaller and occupied by one or two people, need lower-capacity units. Living rooms, which host more people, require higher BTU. Kitchens, with added heat from appliances, also need slightly higher-capacity ACs.\n\nAdditionally, consider how often the room is used. Spaces occupied throughout the day, like home offices, need ACs that can handle continuous operation. Less frequently used rooms, like guest bedrooms, can work with lower-capacity units.\n\nBangladesh’s climate, marked by high humidity and soaring temperatures, can significantly affect an AC’s performance. Rooms with large windows or west-facing walls absorb more heat from direct sunlight, requiring a higher BTU AC to counteract the warmth. Similarly, poor ventilation or inadequate insulation can trap heat, increasing the cooling load.\n\nHigh humidity adds another layer of complexity. While most ACs also function as dehumidifiers, models with advanced dehumidification features are ideal for areas with extreme humidity. These not only cool the space but also improve indoor air quality, benefiting households with allergies or respiratory concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, well-insulated rooms or spaces shaded by trees may allow for a slightly lower-capacity AC. By considering these environmental factors, you can ensure your AC operates efficiently without overworking itself.\n\nWhile selecting the right capacity is crucial, energy efficiency should also be a top priority. Look for inverter ACs, which adjust their cooling output based on the room’s temperature. Unlike traditional ACs, which operate at full capacity until the desired temperature is reached and then shut off, inverter models maintain a consistent temperature by modulating their power usage. This not only reduces electricity consumption but also extends the lifespan of the unit.\n\nEnergy efficiency is often indicated by the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) or star rating of the AC. A higher EER or more stars signify better efficiency, meaning the AC consumes less electricity for the same amount of cooling. While these models may have a higher upfront cost, they save money on electricity bills over time, making them a cost-effective choice in the long run. Retailers like Star Tech Ltd. offer a wide range of energy-efficient ACs, including inverter models from brands like LG, Samsung, and Gree.\n\nChoosing the wrong AC capacity can lead to a host of problems, both in terms of performance and cost. One common mistake is oversizing the AC. While it might seem logical to opt for a more powerful unit, an oversized AC will cool the room quickly but shut off before adequately removing humidity. This leaves the space feeling damp and uncomfortable, negating the purpose of the AC. Additionally, frequent cycling increases wear and tear, shortening the unit’s lifespan.\n\nUndersizing the AC is equally problematic. A unit with insufficient BTU will struggle to cool the room, running continuously and consuming excessive electricity. This not only leads to skyrocketing energy bills but also causes the AC to overheat and break down more frequently.\n\nAnother pitfall is ignoring future needs. For example, if you plan to use the room for different purposes—such as converting a study into a guest bedroom—you should factor in potential changes when selecting the AC capacity. Planning ahead ensures your investment remains relevant and effective over time.\n\nIf you’re unsure about calculating BTU or selecting the right AC, don’t hesitate to seek professional advice. Many retailers, includingStar Tech Ltd., offer free consultations to help customers choose the best AC for their needs. Star Tech AC Ton Calculator also plays a vital role in selecting the right air conditioner for your room. Their experts can assess your space, take into account factors like room size, usage patterns, and environmental conditions, and recommend the ideal capacity and model.\n\nBased on typical room sizes in urban areas like Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet, there are some popular AC capacities. Small bedrooms, which are common in apartments and compact homes, typically measure 100–150 square feet and require an AC with 1.0 Ton (12,000 BTU). Medium-sized bedrooms or study rooms, ranging from 150–250 square feet, usually need a 1.5 Ton (18,000 BTU) unit. Larger living rooms or combined spaces, spanning 300–500 square feet, often call for a 2.0 Ton (24,000 BTU) AC to ensure even and efficient cooling. These capacities align with the needs of most households, but always tailor your choice to your specific requirements.\n\nChoosing the right AC capacity is a balancing act between room size, usage patterns, environmental factors, and energy efficiency. By understanding BTU requirements and avoiding common mistakes, you can ensure your AC delivers optimal cooling without breaking the bank.\n\nAs Bangladesh braces for another hot summer, investing in the right AC capacity will not only keep you comfortable but also save you money in the long run.

The political landscape is buzzing with rallies, courtyard meetings, and campaign announcements as parties and candidates intensify efforts to secure support ahead of the polls.\n\nThe upcoming national election in Bangladesh has witnessed a notable shift in campaigning strategies, with candidates increasingly turning to social media to reach voters. Video messages, infographics, and live sessions have become key tools to engage young voters, adding a new dimension to the festive atmosphere surrounding the polls.\n\nThe Chief Election Commissioner announced the national election schedule on December 11. With the ruling Awami League barred from contesting, the election is primarily a contest among alliances led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nAccording to the Election Commission, Bangladesh now has 127.6 million registered voters, including over 40 million first-time voters.\n\nShamim Bin Rafiq, a student at Dhaka University, said: “Although I was eligible to vote in 2018, I couldn’t. At that time, ordinary people were not very enthusiastic about participating. This time, I am going to vote for the first time.”\n\nHe added: “However, the usual excitement on the ground is still missing. The banners, posters, rallies, and public gatherings that once created an election buzz are largely absent. I hope that on election day, people will participate actively and the festive mood of voting will return.”\n\nRony Ahmed, a businessman from Sherpur in Bogra, said voters are eager to cast their ballots, but the traditional sights of elections—like posters—are absent. As a result, the election atmosphere is much calmer.\n\nAhmed also pointed to a digital divide in campaign outreach, noting that online campaigning has failed to reach rural communities. “Ordinary villagers, especially older people, don’t use social media much. In previous elections, political discussions were common at tea stalls, but that is not happening this time,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, BNP Chairperson Tarique Rahman addressed a rally in Rangpur on January 30. Local BNP activist Rafiqul Islam said party workers have been engaging with voters directly. “We go to people every day and talk to them. Everyone tells us they haven’t been able to vote for a long time, and now they want to vote,” he said.\n\nParul Haque from Kurigram, who last voted in 2008, expressed similar sentiments. Speaking over the phone, she said: “We haven’t been able to vote in the past 17 years. This time, we will vote. We want a fair and smooth election.”\n\nShe added: “We trust the Election Commission. The government and the Commission have said that this time the election will be fair. We will cast our votes for whoever we want.”\n\nIn Dhaka’s Dhanmondi area, rickshaw driver Rahman Ali said: “Online campaigns fail to reach people like us.”\n\nHe noted that posters once helped voters identify candidates in their local areas, but without them, it is unclear who is contesting nearby. Ali added that election posters also created a distinct atmosphere, which he feels is now missing.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "science-tech", "tokens": 526, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:36:45.646161"}

Trade analyst Taran Adarsh said the film earned Rs 32.10 crore net in India on its opening day, with strong performance in mass belts and single-screen theatres, while footfall in urban centres picked up later.\n\nDespite heavy rainfall affecting collections in parts of north India, trade observers expect positive word of mouth and the Republic Day holiday to boost earnings further.

Directed by Aditya Dhar, the film emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time, surpassing Pushpa 2: The Rule, and is planned as a two-part franchise, with its sequel set for release on March 19, 2026.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 232, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:38:08.816488"}

আছে পরিবার ও তাদেরকে ভালো রাখার প্রয়াস।\n\nএকটি সমাজে বিভিন্ন মানুষের বিভিন্ন পেশা থাকে তার মেধা, যোগ্যতা, ও অন্যান্য পরিস্থিতি বিবেচনায়। সবাই যেমন একই রকম মেধাবী ও যোগ্যতা সম্পন্ন হয় না, তেমন সবার সামগ্রিক পরিস্থিতিও এক হয় না। এ কারণেই বিভিন্ন মানুষ বিভিন্ন ভাবে শিক্ষিত হয় ও বিভিন্ন পেশায় নিয়োজিত হয়। এর অর্থ অবশ্য এটা নয় যে, মানুষ হিসেবে কেউ কারও চেয়ে কম বা বেশি সম্মানিত হবেন।  মানুষ সাধারণত, পেশা হিসেবে পছন্দ করে যেসব পেশায় সুযোগ, সুবিধা বেশি সেগুলোকে। আর সকল প্রতিষ্ঠান চায় তার প্রতিষ্ঠানে সবচেয়ে মেধাবী ও যোগ্যতাসম্পন্ন কর্মী থাকুক। তাহলে , সেই প্রতিষ্ঠানের সাফল্য ও উন্নয়ন নিশ্চিত করা যায়। একইভাবে, একটি সমাজ বা রাষ্ট্রের সামগ্রিক উন্নয়ন নির্ভর করে সেই সমাজ বা রাষ্ট্রের মেধাবী ও যোগ্যতাসম্পন্ন মানুষদের সর্বোচ্চ ব্যবহার করা যাচ্ছে কিনা তার উপরে।\n\nএকটি মুক্ত-অর্থনীতি ভিত্তিক সমাজে সবাই স্বাধীন তার পেশা ও অন্যান্য পছন্দের ব্যাপারে। তাই, অধিক মেধাবী ও যোগ্যতাসম্পন্ন মানুষদের দেশের সামগ্রিক উন্নয়নের জন্য জরুরী কাজগুলোতে আকৃষ্ট করার জন্য বিভিন্ন সুযোগ-সুবিধা দেয়ার চেষ্টা করা হয়। এ কারণেই উন্নত ও উন্নয়নশীল দেশগুলোতে শিক্ষক, ডাক্তার, প্রকৌশলী ও বিজ্ঞানীদের অন্যান্য পেশার তুলনায় বেশি সুযোগ সুবিধা দেয়া হয়। কারণ, তারাই রাষ্ট্রকে উন্নয়নের দিকে নিয়ে যেতে নেতৃত্ব দিয়ে থাকেন। কিন্তু,  কোন পেশার সাথে অন্য পেশার তুলনা হয় না। একজন অভিজ্ঞ কৃষক যেমন একটি জাতির জন্য জরুরী, তেমনি একজন শিক্ষকও জাতি গঠনের জন্য জরুরী। আমি অর্থনীতিবিদ নই, তবে বাস্তবতা দেখি এবং বুঝার চেষ্টা করি। সেই দেখা ও বুঝার আলোকে কিছু বিষয় তুলে ধরতে চাই।\n\nপাশের দেশগুলো দেখলেই বোঝা যায় বাংলাদেশের জাতীয় পে স্কেল অনেক পুরোনো। বাংলাদেশে সর্বশেষ আপডেট হয়েছিল ২০১৫ সালে, যেখানে সর্বনিম্ন বেতন ৮,২৫০ টাকা (প্রায় ৬৭.৫ ডলার)। অথচ ভারতে ২০১৬ সালে ন্যূনতম বেতন দাঁড়ায় ১৮,০০০ রুপি (১৯৯.৪ ডলার), পাকিস্তানে ২০২২ সালে ১৩,৫৫০ রুপি (৪৮.১ ডলার), শ্রীলঙ্কায় ২০২৫ সালে ৪০,০০০ রুপি (১২৯.৩ ডলার), ফিলিপাইনে ২০২৬ সালে ১৪,৬৩৪ পেসো (২৪৬.৯ ডলার) এবং ভিয়েতনামে ২০২৪ সালে ২,৩৪০,০০০ ডং (৮৯ ডলার)।\n\nবাংলাদেশের প্রথম শ্রেণির সরকারি কর্মচারীরা—এমপি, সচিব, পুলিশ সুপার, সরকারি ব্যাংকের কর্মকর্তা, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষক, চিকিৎসক, প্রকৌশলী—যাঁরা আইন বানান, রাষ্ট্রের হাজার কোটি টাকার সিদ্ধান্তে সই করেন, জননিরাপত্তা সামলান, মানুষের জীবন বাঁচান, অবকাঠামো দাঁড় করান, আর জ্ঞান তৈরি করেন—তাঁদের বৈধ আয়ে যদি একটি “মর্যাদাপূর্ণ, মানসম্মত” জীবনযাপন সম্ভব না হয়, তাহলে দেশ নীরবে নীরবে প্রলোভনের বাজার তৈরি করে। এটা “খারাপ মানুষ” বনাম “ভালো মানুষ”—এমন কোনো সিনেমার গল্প নয়। এটা বাস্তব জীবনের নিষ্ঠুর চাপ: বাড়িভাড়া বাড়ে, সন্তানের পড়াশোনার খরচ থামে না, অসুস্থতা হঠাৎ এসে সঞ্চয় গিলে খায়, আর সামাজিক মর্যাদার জায়গায় এসে মানুষকে বারবার ছোট করে দেয়। বিশ্বব্যাংকের এক গবেষণায় দেখা যায়, যখন দুর্নীতির প্রত্যাশিত লাভ বেতনের চেয়ে বেশি হয়, তখন ঝুঁকি বাড়ে। সত্যিটা বলি: অধিকাংশ দুর্নীতি সিনেমার মতো বড় নয়। এটা ছোট, নিত্যদিনের, প্রায় “স্বাভাবিক” হয়ে যাওয়া—ফাইল তিন দিনে হওয়ার কথা, তিন মাস লাগে—যদি না “স্পিড মানি” থাকে। অন্যদিকে, বিনিয়োগকারীরা রাস্তা-বিদ্যুৎ দেখে, ঠিকই। কিন্তু তারা আরও দেখে—আইন-কানুন কি স্বচ্ছ? অনুমোদন প্রক্রিয়া কি পরিষ্কার? নাকি “ট্র্যাপ”?\n\nএই কারণেই বাংলাদেশের নবম সরকারি বেতন কাঠামো (৯ম পে স্কেল)  শুধু কাগুজে একটা সংশোধনী নয়। এটা নৈতিক ও অর্থনৈতিক—দুই দিক থেকেই অত্যন্ত জরুরি। নবম পে স্কেল নিয়ে চলমান কমিশনের প্রক্রিয়া সম্পর্কে প্রতিবেদনে বলা হয়েছে, ২০২৩ সালের মার্চ থেকে ৯ শতাংশের ওপরেই রয়েছে। ফলে যে বেতন একসময় পরিবার চালাত, আজ তা ভাড়া, স্কুল, চিকিৎসা, যাতায়াত—সব সামলাতে গিয়ে হাঁপিয়ে ওঠে। এদিকে সরকার ২০২৫ সালের জুলাইয়ে নবম পে স্কেলের জন্য পে কমিশন গঠন করেছে, রিপোর্ট পাওয়ার পর ধাপে ধাপে বাস্তবায়নের কথাও আলোচনায় এসেছে—এবং লক্ষ্য রাখা হচ্ছে যেন মুদ্রাস্ফীতি সমন্বয়ের পর প্রকৃত বেতন ২০১৫ সালের বাস্তব মূল্যমানের নিচে না নামে। অর্থাৎ রাষ্ট্র নিজেই বুঝছে চাপটা সত্যি। এখন প্রশ্ন—এটাকে আমরা টেকনিক্যাল ফাইল হিসেবে রাখব, নাকি জাতীয় অগ্রাধিকার বানাব?\n\nএটা বোঝার জন্য পাশের দেশগুলোকে দেখলেই চলে। একই ধরনের অর্থনীতি ও জনতাত্ত্বিক বাস্তবতার তুলনায় বাংলাদেশের “শেষ বড় আপডেট” তুলনামূলকভাবে পুরোনো—বাংলাদেশে জাতীয় পে স্কেল-২০১৫ কার্যকর হয় ১ জুলাই ২০১৫, যেখানে সর্বনিম্ন মূল বেতন ৮,২৫০ টাকা, আনুমানিক ডলারে প্রায় ৬৭.৫। ভারতে ৭ম কেন্দ্রীয় বেতন কমিশন ১ জানুয়ারি ২০১৬ থেকে কার্যকর হয়ে ন্যূনতম বেতন ১৮,০০০ রুপি, আনুমানিক ১৯৯.৪ ডলার। পাকিস্তানে Revised Pay Scale ২০২২ (BPS) ১ জুলাই ২০২২ থেকে, ন্যূনতম ১৩,৫৫০ রুপি, আনুমানিক ৪৮.১ ডলার—যেখানে ভাতা/রিলিফ আলাদা করে যোগ হয়। শ্রীলঙ্কায় পাবলিক সার্ভিস বেতন সংশোধনের সিদ্ধান্ত (Circular 10/2025) ১ জানুয়ারি ২০২৫, যেখানে স্কেল শুরু হয় ৪০,০০০ রুপি থেকে, আনুমানিক ১২৯.৩ ডলার এবং পরিশোধ ধাপে ধাপে। ফিলিপাইনে Executive Order 64-এর বেতন সূচির তৃতীয় ট্রাঞ্চ কার্যকর ১ জানুয়ারি ২০২৬; Salary Grade 1 হলো ১৪,৬৩৪ পেসো, আনুমানিক ২৪৬.৯ ডলার। ভিয়েতনামে Decree 73/2024 অনুযায়ী ১ জুলাই ২০২৪ থেকে বেস/স্ট্যাচুটরি পে রেট ২,৩৪০,০০০ ডং, আনুমানিক ৮৯ ডলার—এটি বেস রেট, যার গুণিতকে টেবিলভিত্তিক বেতন দাঁড়ায়। এই তুলনাই বলে দেয়—অন্যরা নিয়মিত আপডেট করছে, আর আমরা একই কাঠামো টেনে নিচ্ছি যেন রাষ্ট্রের সেবাদাতাদের বাস্তব জীবনযাত্রা থেমে আছে। বাংলাদেশকে কারও মডেল অন্ধভাবে কপি করতে হবে না; কিন্তু নীতিটা মানতেই হবে—আপনি যদি বিশ্বমানের সেবা চান এবং টেবিলের নিচে লেনদেন কমাতে চান, তাহলে পেশাদার সরকারি জীবনকে এমন এক ত্যাগের নাম বানিয়ে রাখা যাবে না, যা শুধু ধনীদের পক্ষে বহন করা সম্ভব।\n\nযাঁরা বলেন “এটা তো খরচ”—তাঁরা রাষ্ট্রকে শুধু হিসাবের খাতায় দেখেন। অথচ আধুনিক বেতন কাঠামো রাষ্ট্রের “পাইপলাইন”; পাইপলাইন ভেঙে গেলে ভোগে সবাই—বিশেষ করে দরিদ্র মানুষ, যাদের কাছে “প্রাইভেট” বিকল্প সবসময় থাকে না। সঠিকভাবে করা পে স্কেল একদিকে সৎ কাজকে “শাস্তি” হওয়া থেকে বাঁচায়—কারণ বেতন জীবনযাত্রার খরচের সঙ্গে না মিললে রাষ্ট্র নীরবে প্রতিভা হারায়; অন্যদিকে বেতন মানসিক স্থিতি দেয় বলে সেবার মান ও উৎপাদনশীলতা বাড়ে। আর সবচেয়ে বড় কথা, এটি আস্থা ফিরিয়ে আনে—যা অর্থনীতির অদৃশ্য মুদ্রা।\n\nপে স্কেল নিয়ে আলোচনা অনেক সময় সংখ্যা হয়ে যায়—কত শতাংশ বাড়বে, কত গ্রেড, কত ভাতা। কিন্তু সেই নার্সের কাছে নবম পে স্কেল মানে অন্য জিনিস: “আমি কি রোগী দেখার সময় মাথার ভেতর বাজারের লিস্টটা থামাতে পারব?” একজন শিক্ষক ভাবেন—“আমি কি পরীক্ষার খাতা দেখার সময় টিউশনের চিন্তা ছাড়াই মন দিতে পারব?” একজন সৎ পুলিশ ভাবেন—“আমি কি মাস শেষে কারও কাছে হাত পাততে বাধ্য হব না?” এই প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর যদি ‘হ্যাঁ’ হয়, তাহলে সেবা বদলাবে। সেবা বদলালে মানুষ রাষ্ট্রকে বিশ্বাস করবে। বিশ্বাস বাড়লে কর দেওয়ার মানসিকতা বাড়ে, নিয়ম মানার সংস্কৃতি বাড়ে, বিনিয়োগের আস্থা বাড়ে—এভাবেই অর্থনীতি ভেতর থেকে শক্ত হয়। পে স্কেল দরকার উন্নয়নের জন্য।  উন্নয়ন মানে শুধু ভবন নয়; উন্নয়ন মানে মানুষের মর্যাদা। মর্যাদা ছাড়া রাষ্ট্র থাকে, কিন্তু দেশ থাকে না।\n\nএকটা ন্যায্য ও মানসম্মত পে স্কেল তিনভাবে কাজ করে- প্রথমত, অসহায়ত্ব কমায়- নিম্ন গ্রেডের কর্মচারীরা বাস্তব জীবনের খরচ সামলাতে পারলে, “বাঁচার জন্য” ছোট দুর্নীতির চাপ কমে। দ্বিতীয়ত, শুদ্ধাচার বাস্তবায়নযোগ্য হয়-বেতন বাড়লে রাষ্ট্র বিশ্বাসযোগ্যভাবে বলতে পারে: “তোমাকে সেবা দেওয়ার জন্য বেতন দিচ্ছি—এখন মানদণ্ড থাকবে, এবং দুর্নীতি ধরা পড়লে শাস্তি হবে।” ন্যায্য বেতন ছাড়া কড়াকড়ি অনেক সময় নিছক নিষ্ঠুরতা মনে হয়। তৃতীয়ত, সিস্টেম পরিষ্কার করে- নতুন পে স্কেল মানে গ্রেড পরিষ্কার করা, ভাতা যুক্তিসংগত করা, ডিজিটাল পে-রোল, ফাঁকফোকর বন্ধ করা—আর দুর্নীতি জন্মায় ঠিক এই ফাঁকফোকরেই। মানুষকেন্দ্রিক, উন্নয়নমুখী নবম পে স্কেলের লক্ষ্য হওয়া উচিত-মুদ্রাস্ফীতির বাস্তবতা, নিম্ন গ্রেডে তুলনামূলক বেশি বৃদ্ধি, স্বচ্ছ ও সরল ভাতা কাঠামো, ডিজিটাল পে-রোল ও অডিট ট্রেইল, পারফরম্যান্স ও সেবা মানদণ্ড, হুইসেলব্লোয়ার সুরক্ষা ও বাস্তব শাস্তি। বেতন বাড়িয়ে জবাবদিহি না বাড়ালে এটা ব্যর্থ হতে পারে; আবার, জবাবদিহি বাড়িয়ে বেতন না বাড়ালে নিষ্ঠুরতা হয়ে যায়। তাই, বেতন যুগোপযোগী করে জবাবদিহিতাও উন্নত করতে হবে।\n\nক্লান্ত শরীর আর অপমানিত মর্যাদার ওপর দাঁড়িয়ে “স্মার্ট বাংলাদেশ” গড়া যায় না। শিক্ষক, চিকিৎসক, প্রকৌশলী, পুলিশ, সচিব বা এমপি—যদি ন্যায্য বেতন ও সম্মান না পান, তবে দায়িত্ববোধ, মানবিকতা ও সেবার মান ক্ষয়ে যায়। বেতন কাঠামো বাস্তবসম্মত না রেখে শুধু নৈতিকতার বক্তৃতায় দুর্নীতি কমানো সম্ভব নয়। সঠিক বেতন, নিয়ম ও নজরদারির সমন্বয়েই সেবা ও সিস্টেম বদলাতে পারে। নবম পে স্কেল শুধু কর্মচারীদের দাবি নয়—এটা সেবাদাতাদের মর্যাদা ও মানুষের অধিকার নিশ্চিত করার প্রতিশ্রুতি। রাষ্ট্রকে বিশ্বাসযোগ্য করতে এখনই বাস্তবায়ন জরুরি।\n\nবর্তমান অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের সামনে নবম পে স্কেল বাস্তবায়নের যুক্তি শুধু “জনপ্রিয়তা” নয়—এটা রাষ্ট্র সংস্কারের সুযোগ। কারণ অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার তুলনামূলকভাবে স্বল্পমেয়াদি রাজনৈতিক প্রতিদ্বন্দ্বিতা থেকে দূরে থেকে কাঠামোগত সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে পারে—এবং নতুন নির্বাচিত সরকার যাতে বাস্তবায়নের রোডম্যাপ পায়, সেই ভিত্তিটা এখনই তৈরি করা জরুরি। এই সরকারের প্রধান উপদেষ্টা মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস আন্তর্জাতিকভাবে স্বীকৃত নোবেল শান্তি পুরস্কারপ্রাপ্ত ব্যক্তি এবং বৈশ্বিক অর্থনীতি ও উন্নয়ন আলোচনায় গ্রহণযোগ্য মুখ—ফলে বড় ধরনের রাষ্ট্র সংস্কারে দেশি-বিদেশি আস্থা তৈরির সক্ষমতা রাখেন। অর্থ উপদেষ্টা ড. সালেহউদ্দিন আহমেদ বাংলাদেশের সাবেক কেন্দ্রীয় ব্যাংক (বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক) গভর্নর হিসেবে আর্থিক খাত ও রাজস্ব-ব্যয়ের বাস্তবতা বোঝেন—পে স্কেলের মতো সংস্কারকে বাজেট শৃঙ্খলা ও মুদ্রাস্ফীতির ঝুঁকির সাথে মেলাতে তাঁর অভিজ্ঞতা কার্যকর হতে পারে। পরিকল্পনা উপদেষ্টা অধ্যাপক ওয়াহিদউদ্দিন মাহমুদ দেশের খ্যাতিমান অর্থনীতিবিদ—নীতির “লং টার্ম” প্রভাব, মানবসম্পদ ও উৎপাদনশীলতার সম্পর্ক নিয়ে তাঁর মতো মানুষের উপস্থিতি পে স্কেলকে কেবল বেতন বৃদ্ধি না রেখে রাষ্ট্র সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির নীতিতে রূপ দিতে পারে। আর আইন উপদেষ্টা অধ্যাপক আসিফ নজরুল একজন আইন শিক্ষক/বিশ্লেষক হিসেবে জবাবদিহি, শুদ্ধাচার, অভিযোগ নিষ্পত্তির মতো প্রতিষ্ঠানগত বিষয়কে বেতন সংস্কারের সাথে বাঁধতে সাহায্য করতে পারেন—কারণ দুর্নীতি দমনে শুধু টাকা নয়, নিয়মও লাগে। এই সমন্বয়টাই অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় শক্তি হতে পারে: ন্যায্য বেতন, শক্ত নিয়ম ও ডিজিটাল স্বচ্ছতা।\n\nশেষ কথা, ক্লান্ত শরীর আর অপমানিত মর্যাদার ওপর দাঁড়িয়ে “স্মার্ট বাংলাদেশ” গড়া যায় না। একজন স্কুলশিক্ষক যদি বাজার খরচ তুলতে রাতভর টিউশনি করেন, পরদিন ক্লাসে কী থাকে? একজন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষক যদি গবেষণার বই কেনা, কনফারেন্সে যাওয়া, ছাত্রদের থিসিস দেখানো—সবকিছুর খরচ নিজের পকেট থেকে টানতে টানতে ক্লান্ত হয়ে পড়েন, জ্ঞান তৈরির সেই আগুনটা কত দিন জ্বলে? একজন হাসপাতালকর্মী যদি ভাড়াই দিতে না পারেন, দশ ঘণ্টার ডিউটির শেষে করুণা কোথায় থাকে? একজন সরকারি চিকিৎসক যদি একদিকে রোগীর চাপ, অন্যদিকে পরিবারের ন্যূনতম খরচ—এই দুই চাপে প্রতিদিন ভেঙে পড়েন, তখন মানবিকতা টিকে থাকে কীভাবে? একজন প্রকৌশলী যদি রাত জেগে ব্রিজের নকশা, সড়কের মান, ভবনের নিরাপত্তা—এসবের দায় কাঁধে নিয়ে ঘরে ফিরে সন্তানের স্কুল ফি নিয়ে হিসাব করতে বসেন, তখন দায়িত্ববোধকে বাঁচিয়ে রাখতে কতটা লড়াই লাগে? একজন পুলিশ সুপার যদি জননিরাপত্তা, রাজনৈতিক চাপ, মিছিল-মিটিং, মামলা—সবকিছুর ভার বইতে বইতে দেখেন তার বৈধ আয়ে পরিবারকে সম্মান নিয়ে রাখা কঠিন, তখন প্রলোভন আর ‘প্রয়োজন’ একাকার হয়ে যায়। একজন সচিব যদি হাজার কোটি টাকার প্রকল্পের সই করেন, নীতির সিদ্ধান্ত নেন, রাষ্ট্রের সবচেয়ে ঝুঁকিপূর্ণ চাপে থাকেন, অথচ তাঁর অফিসের চারপাশে সুবিধাবাদী চক্র দিনের পর দিন ফিসফাস করে—“সবাই তো নেয়”—তখন একজন সৎ মানুষের মাথার ভেতরেও যুদ্ধ শুরু হয়। আর একজন এমপি যদি এলাকার হাজারো মানুষের চিকিৎসা, চাকরি, শিক্ষা, সংকট—সবকিছুর দরজা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হন, কিন্তু তাঁর কাজের স্বচ্ছ ব্যয় কাঠামো ও সম্মানজনক পারিশ্রমিক বাস্তবতার সঙ্গে না মেলে, তখন রাজনীতিও ধীরে ধীরে সেবার বদলে লেনদেনের ভাষা শিখে ফেলে। একজন কর্মচারীর বেতন যদি মুদ্রাস্ফীতিতে ভেঙে পড়ে, তখন কারও জমির খতিয়ান, পেনশন, প্রতিবন্ধী ভাতা—এসব নিয়ে ফাইল কীভাবে এগোয়? এটা সরকারি ব্যয়ের “অঙ্ক” নয়। এটা মানুষের অধিকার পাওয়ার পথ—অপমান ছাড়া, ভয় ছাড়া—এটা নিশ্চিত করার প্রশ্ন। বেতন কাঠামোকে বাস্তবসম্মত না রেখে শুধু নৈতিকতার বক্তৃতা দিয়ে দুর্নীতি কমানো যায় না। বরং সঠিক বেতন, সঠিক নিয়ম এবং সঠিক নজরদারি—এই তিনটির সমন্বয়েই দুর্নীতি ও সেবা—দুইয়েরই মান বদলাতে শুরু করে। সঠিকভাবে প্রণীত ও বাস্তবায়িত নবম পে স্কেল হতে পারে এক মোড় ঘোরানো সিদ্ধান্ত: সেবার মান বাড়বে, সিস্টেম পরিষ্কার হবে, ক্ষুদ্র দুর্নীতির চাপ কমবে—এবং রাষ্ট্রকে মনে হবে জনগণের, শোষকের নয়। নবম পে স্কেলকে আমরা যদি “কর্মচারীদের দাবি” হিসেবে দেখি, তাহলে অর্ধেক সত্য দেখব। পূর্ণ সত্যটা হলো—সেবাদাতাদের মর্যাদার প্রশ্ন, আর সাধারণ মানুষের সেবা পাওয়ার অধিকার। রাষ্ট্রকে যারা মানুষের দোরগোড়ায় এনে দেয়, তাদের জীবন যদি অনিশ্চিত থাকে, তবে মানুষের জীবনও অনিশ্চিত থাকে। আজ নবম পে স্কেল মানে শুধু বেশি বেতন নয়—এটা মানুষের চোখে রাষ্ট্রকে আবার বিশ্বাসযোগ্য করে তোলার প্রতিজ্ঞা। আলোচনা যথেষ্ট হয়েছে, হাসপাতালের সেই করিডোরের লাইন এখনও অপেক্ষা করছে…\n\nমোঃ নিয়াজ আলমগীর, সহকারি অধ্যাপকআধুনিক ভাষা ইনস্টিটিউটজগন্নাথ বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, ঢাকা", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1988, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:38:11.758989"}

রাখতে হবে। তবে শুধু আইন প্রয়োগ করলে হবে না, জনসচেতনতা জাগানোও অপরিহার্য। পরিষ্কার দেয়াল শুধু চোখের আরাম নয়, এটা নাগরিক শৃঙ্খলার প্রতীক।\n\nঢাকার আরেকটি বড় সমস্যা হলো পর্যাপ্ত পার্কিং সুবিধার অভাব। সড়ক ও ফুটপাথে যেমন-তেমনভাবে গাড়ি পার্ক করায় যানজট বাড়ে হু-হু করে এবং পথচারীদের চলাচল ভীষণভাবে ব্যাহত হয়। অনেক সময় ওবার বা পাঠাও ট্যাক্সিগুলো যাত্রী না পেয়ে শুধু শুধু রাস্তায় ঘোরাঘুরি করে বা ব্যস্ত রাস্তায় ডেকে দাঁড়িয়ে থাকে, ফলে জ্বালানি পোড়ে এবং বায়ুদূষণ বাড়ে।\n\nমেট্রোরেল সম্প্রসারণের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে মেট্রো করিডোরের গা ঘেঁষে নিরাপদ বহুতল পার্কিং ব্যবস্থা গড়ে তোলা জরুরি। এতে ‘পার্ক অ্যান্ড রাইড’ ব্যবস্থা চালু হবে এবং মূল সড়কের জটলা কমবে। নির্দিষ্ট এলাকায় সাইকেল চালানোর সুযোগ ও মেট্রো স্টেশনের কাছে নিরাপদ সাইকেল পার্কিংয়ের ব্যবস্থা পরিবেশবান্ধব যাতায়াতে বড় সহায়ক হতে পারে।\n\nঢাকায় হাঁটাচলা অনেক সময় আসল বিপদ, বিশেষ করে নারী, শিশু ও বয়স্কদের জন্য। ফুটপাত বেদখল হয়ে যাওয়ায় মানুষকে নিরুপায় হয়ে ব্যস্ত সড়কে নামতে হয়। মেট্রো স্টেশন, বড় অফিস পাড়া, বিপণিবিতান ও বাস টার্মিনালকে যুক্ত করে আলাদাভাবে উড়াল হাঁটার পথ (ফুটওভার ব্রিজ) তৈরি করলে পথচারীদের নিরাপত্তা ও চলাচল দুটোই অনেক স্বচ্ছন্দ হবে।\n\nএ ক্ষেত্রে কাঠমান্ডুর একটা উদাহরণ দেওয়া যেতে পারে। সেখানকার অনেক এলাকায় দেয়ালে পোস্টার লাগানোকে সামাজিকভাবেই খুব খারাপ চোখে দেখা হয়। এমনকি জাতীয় নির্বাচনের সময়ও সরকারি দেয়ালে একটা পোস্টারও দেখা যায় না। আইন প্রয়োগ তুলনামূলকভাবে কম হলেও মানুষ সরকারি ও বেসরকারি স্থাপনার প্রতি বড় সম্মান দেখায়। এই সংস্কৃতি গড়ে উঠেছে ধারাবাহিক নাগরিক উদ্যোগ, প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা স্তর থেকে নাগরিক শিক্ষা এবং দীর্ঘমেয়াদি জনসচেতনতার প্রচারের মাধ্যমে। পরিষ্কার দেয়াল সেখানে নাগরিক গর্বের প্রতীক। একইভাবে অযথা হর্ন বাজানোও সেখানে বিরল। রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছার সঙ্গে জনসাধারণের সহযোগিতা থাকলে ঢাকাতেও এমন সংস্কৃতি গড়ে তোলা সম্ভব।\n\nঢাকার গণপরিবহন ব্যবস্থা এখনো বড় এক পরীক্ষার মুখে। বাসগুলোর বাহ্যিক চেহারা যেন রেসলিং টিমের মেম্বারের মতো—আঁকাবাঁকা, ঠোকাঠুকি খাওয়া এবং উদ্ভট রঙের ছটা। বাসের ভেতরের নোংরা আসন ও অতিরিক্ত ভিড় এবং তাদের অনিয়মিত চলাচল মানুষকে বাধ্য হয়েই ব্যক্তিগত গাড়ির দিকে ঝুঁকতে উৎসাহিত করছে, যা যানজট ও দূষণ দুই-ই পাল্লা দিয়ে বাড়াচ্ছে।\n\nপরিষ্কার-পরিচ্ছন্ন ও নিয়মমাফিক বাসের সংখ্যা বাড়ানো এবং সময়সূচি নিশ্চিতভাবে মেনে চলা অতীব জরুরি। বাস সেবাকে একটি নিয়ন্ত্রিত ও গোছানো কাঠামোর মধ্যে আনার উদ্যোগ বাস্তবায়িত হবে এটা সবার এক সুদীর্ঘ প্রত্যাশা।\n\nশব্দদূষণ ঢাকার আরেকটি মারাত্মক সমস্যা। লাগাতার হর্ন এবং সাইরেনের অপব্যবহার জনস্বাস্থ্য ও নগর শৃঙ্খলার জন্য খুবই ক্ষতিকর। কঠোর নজরদারি ও সচেতনতা ছাড়া এই সমস্যা দূর করা সম্ভব নয়।\n\nঢাকার রূপান্তর শুধু সরকারের একার পক্ষে সম্ভব নয়। নাগরিকদের দৈনন্দিন দায়িত্বশীল আচরণও জরুরি। এই ছোট ছোট অভ্যাসগুলোই এক হয়ে একটি শহরের চরিত্র গড়ে তোলে।\n\nরাজনৈতিক নেতৃত্ব ও নাগরিক দায়িত্ববোধ যখন হাতে হাত রেখে কাজ করবে, তখন ঢাকা সত্যিকার অর্থেই বদলে যেতে পারে। তখন ঢাকা হবে আধুনিক, পরিচ্ছন্ন ও মর্যাদাপূর্ণ একটি শহর, যা তার বাসিন্দাদের জন্য গর্বের বিষয় এবং অন্য শহরগুলোর জন্য উপযোগী উদাহরণ।\n\nকবিরউদ্দিন,জিআইএস ও রিমোট সেন্সিং বিশেষজ্ঞ\n\nবাংলাদেশ কান্ট্রি ফোকাল পয়েন্ট, ইসিমোড, নেপাল", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens":

However, Indian police have yet to locate the two main accused—Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh—delaying the repatriation process. Once their whereabouts are confirmed, the extradition process will begin.\n\nPolice said 11 people have been arrested so far in connection with the murder. Of them, six have given confessional statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, while four others have recorded statements as witnesses under the same provision.\n\nInvestigators have also recovered two foreign pistols, 52 rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, fake number plates, and cheques worth Tk218 crore linked to 53 bank accounts, according to the DMP.\n\nAdditional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam disclosed the information at a press conference at the DMP Media Centre on Sunday. He said two individuals—Purti and Sami—were arrested for helping Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh flee to India.\n\nThose arrested include Faisal’s father, mother, wife, friend and brother-in-law. Others include rent-a-car businessman Mufti Md Nuruzzaman Nomani alias Ujjal, Faisal’s associate Md Kabir, and two individuals accused of facilitating the escape to India—Sibun Dew and Sanjay Chisim.\n\nNazrul Islam said arresting the prime accused would provide greater clarity about those who orchestrated the killing. “We have some information, but we will not disclose names at this stage for the sake of the investigation,” he said.\n\nHe added that Hadi had become increasingly vocal after August 5, with clear political views and ideological positioning.\n\n“We suspect that those opposed to this ideology, or those who were affected by developments after August 5, may be behind the murder,” he said.\n\nVarious organisations, including Inqilab Mancha, along with students and members of the public, continued protests at Shahbagh in Dhaka, demanding justice for Hadi’s murder. As part of a pre-announced road blockade program, demonstrators gathered at Shaheed Osman Hadi Chattar at 2pm on Sunday.\n\nInqilab Mancha’s Dhaka University spokesperson Fatima Tasnim Jhuma told Dhaka Tribune that the protest would continue until justice is served.\n\n“We no longer have confidence in law enforcement agencies. We will announce our next course of action today,” she said.\n\nNazrul Islam said the killing was premeditated. After the incident, Faisal and Alamgir travelled from Dhaka to Aminbazar in a CNG-run auto-rickshaw, then by car to Kalampur, and later to the Haluaghat border in Mymensingh.\n\nAt the border, they were assisted by Philip Pal and Sanjay, who allegedly engage in illegal cross-border movement.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/388315/how-digital-communication-is-redefining", "title": "How digital communication is redefining school-parent communication", "body": "Two parties play the most instrumental role in a child’s learning journey at school: the parents and the school authorities, particularly the teachers. Establishing a clear and consistent line of communication between these two is crucial to ensuring a child’s academic progress and overall development.\n\nFor decades, communication largely relied on paperwork: report cards, homework sheets, and various notices that students carried home in their backpacks. But this system was prone to gaps. Important messages, like teacher feedback or test dates, were often missed, leaving parents confused or uninformed about key developments.\n\nToday, with digital transformation sweeping through every sector, education is no exception. Communication between teachers and parents is rapidly shifting from traditional methods, handwritten notes, phone calls, and in-person meetings, to more streamlined, digital platforms that cater to the pace and needs of modern families.\n\nThis shift not only facilitates faster communication but also helps build stronger partnerships between home and school.\n\nMore and more parents now prefer digital updates over physical meetings, reflecting a change in expectations from schools. This is a positive trend: as studies suggest, informed parents are better positioned to support their children’s growth. According to educational psychologists, when parents stay engaged and monitor their child’s progress regularly, it leads to stronger academic outcomes and emotional well-being.\n\nIn light of this, many progressive schools are embracing digital platforms for parent communication. One such initiative is being implemented at Glenrich International School, where we have recently launched a dedicated parent communication app. This platform offers parents real-time access to their child’s academic updates, class schedules, and feedback—all in one place, without needing to call or visit the school.\n\nThe advantages of such tools are multifaceted. Parents receive instant notifications about attendance, academic performance, behavior, and upcoming school events. Teachers can share photos, videos, and summaries of classroom activities, giving parents a window into their child’s learning day. Real-time messaging allows urgent information, like schedule changes or emergencies, to be shared without delay, ensuring that parents can respond immediately when needed.\n\nMoreover, these digital tools foster a collaborative environment. Two-way communication, through instant messaging, direct feedback, or group announcements, builds trust and transparency. This helps create a strong sense of community between educators and families, all united in supporting the student’s success.\n\nResearch from Southeast Missouri State University has found that digital communication tools enhance student learning by encouraging collaboration, quick access to information, and personalized support. Increased parental involvement, enabled by these platforms, directly correlates with improved learning outcomes.\n\nWhen digital tools are proving effective in improving communication, engagement, and student performance, it’s worth asking: Why hold on to outdated methods? It’s time for all schools to reconsider their approach and embrace the digital shift that supports every child’s growth journey.\n\nAnit Arora is theprincipal of Glenrich International School, Satarkul.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 465, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:39:40.331022"}

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/health-wellness/181408/menstrual-hygiene-%E2%80%93-a-necessity-not-a-luxury", "title": "Menstrual hygiene – a necessity, not a luxury", "body": "Proper management of menstrual hygiene is extremely important for every woman, not only due to their health concerns, but also when it is about giving birth to a healthy child. If menstruation hygiene is not properly maintained, it would have a long term impact on the number of patients having complications due to unhealthy practices during menstruation, that would consequently have an adverse effect on the entire health system.\n\nMaintaining hygiene by reusing old cloths and rugs is a complicated process. Using disposable items, such as sanitary pads, assures proper hygiene followed by an easy usage. Nazneen Akhter, who is a Public Health and Policy Planning expert, said, “There always remains a question of the affordability of such products. Is it possible for everyone to avail it? No. Sad, but true - they are not getting it.” According to the Bangladesh National Hygiene baseline report in 2014, using old cloths or rugs instead of a sanitary napkin was the predominant menstruation management material for nearly 89percent  of menstruating girls and women.\n\nWho suffers the most?\n\nStarting from the raw materials to a finished product, a number of taxes are imposed on a commodity, including supplementary duty, custom duty, ATV, regulatory duty and value added tax. By the time the product reaches the customers, it costs Tk120 to 160, which may seem reasonably priced to well-off families, but the scenario isn’t exactly the same for lower income people.\n\nIt is difficult for Amina Khatun to provide these sanitary pads for her daughter. The mother of three said, “my husband is a security guard and I work as a cleaner. Our earning doesn’t allow us to afford such products for our daughters. And during those days, they often remain absent at school.”\n\nAccording to a cross-sectional survey named ‘Menstrual hygiene management among Bangladeshi adolescent school girls and risk factors affecting school absence,’ 41percent  of school girls who have reached menarche were reported to miss school, with an average of 2.8 missed days per menstrual cycle.\n\nAddressing the initiative of exempting VAT and SD as a fruitful initiative, Nazneen said, “If the price increases by even Tk1 because of VAT, many women from lower income families would stop using it and go back to their old practice. From that perspective, exempting VAT and SD on such products is something that I believe would be beneficial.”\n\nShefali, who’s working at a garment factory in Rampura as an operator for nearly four years now, is the only earning member of her family. “I have to produce at least 100 to 150 pieces of products every day. Apart from lunch break, I hardly get time to move from my seat.” The mother of an 11 year old has attended various sessions on menstrual hygiene management but still prefers to use a cloth. “I know using a cloth isn’t hygienic, but I have no other option but to use it,” she says. According to Baseline study of RMG workers, 2015, WwW project, Disposable pads or sanitary napkins were used by about 41percent  of RMG workers.\n\nJamal Uddin, Inclusive Business Advisor at the Working with Women project, shared the current scenario of workers at the RMG sector. At present, 90percent  of the female workers are aware about menstrual hygiene and 70percent  of them use sanitary pads. “Many garment industries, for example Ecotec, Renaissance Garments Limited and AKH group are subsidizing their workers, with the amounts ranging from Tk10 to Tk36.” The inclusive business advisor believes, a minimum increase in the price of sanitary products may cause threat to people earning within the borderline, and discourage new users. It may also generate additional costing load for the organization.\n\nWhy are subsidies important?\n\n“Maintaining menstrual hygiene plays an integral role in achieving the SGD goal of Sexual and Reproductive Health. Moreover, as the government is working actively on women empowerment for all economic classes, incentives are required to accelerate this growth in order to achieve bigger impact,” said Jamal Uddin. The issue is being looked after by the government, along with the National Board of Revenue (NBR)’s prompt action, and he believes this will have a good impact in the long run.\n\nAnother Bangladesh National Hygiene baseline report also states that 40percent  of school girls are reported to miss school during menstruation for around three days a month. “Looking at the statistics, it is quite clear why school girls and working women at the lower level in the society need the government’s support the most,” mentioned Ariful Forquan, initiator of Sokhipad, a social business venture with a vision to facilitate affordable and quality sanitary napkins among school girls and lower income working women.\n\nDiscussing the topic of stipend for female students, Ariful, who is the chief operating officer, said, “many school students cannot afford sanitary napkins. Furthermore, there is an issue of inadequate school facilities contributing to the absence of these girls during menstruation. In my opinion, female students should be provided with a packet of sanitary napkins, along with the stipend to ensure no abruption from education and a healthy life.”\n\nSanitary pads are not a luxury product. The market should consider the issue keeping their social responsibilities in mind, instead of having the tendency to generate more profit.\n\nReferring to a report by the Dhaka tribune, the annual market size of sanitary napkins is about Tk400 crores, which is growing at 20percent  per year, according to the industry officials.\n\nThe decision to exempt the supplementary duty was taken in an effort to give local manufacturers an opportunity to expand and meet the demands of local consumption at an affordable price.\n\nTerming it as a classified item, Nazneen said, “it is crucial to make sanitary pads available for every woman. However, making such products available and affordable depends on strong supervision of the market so that the prices cannot go beyond the ability of people earning within the border or lower than that.”\n\nIt is an essential product for women and the market need of it requires proper scrutinization by the government. Preferred to be anonymous, the spokesperson of a local manufacturer said, “if life saving items like saline and condoms can be sold under subsidy and strict price range under the surveillance of the government, then why not sanitary napkins? A fair price tag needs to be introduced by the government, and it should be mandatory for every local manufacturer to follow it.”\n\nRepresentation of health experts in policy making\n\nUrging the government to look for new avenues in order to make sanitary pads available for women at every level of the society, Nazneen, a Public Health and Policy Planning expert, believes, experts from medical backgrounds need to be involved in policy making. “Representation from public health experts can illustrate the medical information and sensitize the respectable authority.”\n\nIt is expected that the price of sanitary pads can be lowered by 40percent  if this exemption is factored in manufacturing sanitary napkins. Thus, it is time for the citizens to wait and aspire that this decision would bring change to the price.\n\nThe concept of keeping everything about menstruation behind the doors still exists in Bangladesh. The recent concern among citizens by being vocal on social media and arranging events by students is certainly an indication of the fact that the level of awareness is increasing slowly, but surely.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1220, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:39:48.667695"}

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people are now living in limbo as refugees across Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Myanmar Government says that Rohingya people are not Burmese citizens – but the Rohingya have been living in Myanmar for generations. Today, they are a people with no home or citizenship. Even their name (the very word ‘Rohingya‘) is denied them in Myanmar.\n\nRohingya people are being widely abused and exploited. They are one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.\n\nIn May 2015, thousands of Rohingya people were forced to cross the dangerous Bay of Bengal, off the coast of south-east Asia, in search of a safe place to live. Many people became stranded at sea and it is estimated that hundreds died.\n\nBoats containing desperate Rohingya refugees were pushed back by Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nAlmost 20,000 Amnesty supporters urged our government to call for, and assist with, immediate search and rescue operations and champion new, humane solutions for refugees in the region.\n\nThough few Rohingya people can afford the boat journey to Australia, some have little option left but to travel here. After a dangerous and desperate journey, they face some of the harshest policies towards asylum seekers in the world, with a number of Rohingya held on Manus Island and Nauru.\n\nThe most recent bout of violence began in August 2017 and in the last four weeks alone more than 400,000 Rohingya people havefled Myanmar to nearby Bangladesh. Amidst reports of killings by Myanmar security forces, satellite images suggest entire villages have been burned to the ground.\n\nAgain, Rohingya people are forced to risk everything for a chance at safety.\n\nImagine you were denied an identity and a place to call home. Your rights to study, work, travel, marry and practice your religion didn’t exist – because you belong nowhere.\n\nYou’re not given any way to prove who you are or where you’re from, so gaining citizenship status anywhere is almost impossible. Wherever you go, you’re locked in detention – simply because of who you are.\n\nThis is the life of a Rohingya person.\n\nRohingya women and children are at particularly great risk, both when travelling and once they arrive in neighbouring countries.\n\nYasmine, a Rohingya woman, was forced to flee Myanmar with her young children, Amina (six) and Tasmin (three). They boarded a fishing boat late one night, hoping to register as refugees in Malaysia and be allowed to stay. Instead the family endured 16 days of seasickness and overcrowding before they were taken to Thailand.\n\nYasmineknew the dangers of escaping, but felt she had no choice. Her only form of identification, a household registration card, was taken away by authorities and never replaced. No identification means no rights. The family’s only option was to leave.\n\nNow, trapped in a tiny room on the outskirts of Bangkok, they live in constant fear that the Thai authorities will arrest and deport them.\n\nImran Mohammad, a 22-year old Rohingya man, fled from Myanmar at the age of 16 after his life was threatened. Arriving on Christmas Island by boat, Imran was then moved to Manus Island, where he has been imprisoned for more than three years.\n\n“I’m a refugee who refuses to surrender my hope”, says Iran. “I hold on to my belief in humanity and freedom. I never got the chance to attend school or university; these words in English are my own – painstakingly studied with limited resources.”\n\nImran recently wrote anopen letter to Malcolm Turnbullcalling for freedom and safety for Rohingya refugees in offshore detention.\n\nThe Myanmar Government should immediately end the violent crackdown on the Rohingya and amend or repeal the 1982 Burma Citizenship Law to provide the Rohingya people with full citizenship in the country.\n\nBangladesh and other governments in Southeast Asia must grant access to those fleeing violence and seeking protection; guaranteeing they will not be pushed back or arbitrarily detained and instead that all their rights will be respected.\n\nJoin ustoday in calling on the Australian government to help end the violence against the Rohingya people.\n\nWith your support, Amnesty International has the global reach and ability to shine a light on the suffering of asylum seekers and demand action.\n\nAmnesty advocates for those who urgently need safety and push governments to do their bit and put people first. We need to continue to be relentless in our fight for the fair and just treatment of refugees looking to Australia for help.\n\nA more expansive humanitarian intake would make it possible for more families who have been split up by conflict and persecution to reunite.\n\nHelp us defend refugee rights:\n\nAmnesty International is a global movement of 10 million people standing up for justice, freedom and equality.

In 1953, he and Francis Crick opened a new horizon in the history of science by discovering the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule. In recognition of this groundbreaking discovery, he, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. His work was so fundamental that it is often described as the beginning of the modern age of biology. He was born on April 6, 1928, in Chicago, USA, and died at the age of 97 on November 6, 2025, in East Northport, New York.\n\nToday, the world of science bids farewell to Dr James D Watson. He was one of the pioneering minds behind the discovery of the DNA double-helix structure, which permanently changed the course of biology and medicine. However, Watson’s influential life of 97 years was not limited to the brilliance of scientific success. His controversial remarks and ethical stances repeatedly called his extraordinary legacy into question. Nevertheless, James Watson, or “Jim,” remains an extremely influential and significant scientist of the century. His impact on the development of human civilization and the future of science will continue to be widely discussed and debated. With deep respect for the work of this great scientist, this article highlights James Watson’s major contributions to science and examines some of his controversial statements and ethical positions.\n\nFrom an early age, James Dewey Watson was interested in science and the liberal arts. He grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended South Shore High School. As a precocious student, he was a contestant on the 1940s radio series “Quiz Kids.” Due to the liberal policies of Robert Hutchins, he was admitted to the University of Chicago at the young age of 15. It was there that he encountered a popular science book about biology written by quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger. The book, What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell, confirmed for the young Watson that genes were the fundamental components of the living cell. He received his Bachelor’s degree in Zoology in 1947.\n\nAfter graduating in 1947, he went to graduate school at Indiana University, where he met two legends in the field—Herman J Muller (who won the Nobel Prize in 1946) and Salvador E Luria. Dr Watson received his doctorate in 1950 under the supervision of Dr Luria. He then traveled to Cambridge—and toward fame.\n\nOne of the most important chapters of his career began at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, where he met Francis Crick. At just 25, Watson and Crick proposed the elegant double-helix model of DNA. They jointly published a groundbreaking, single-page research paper titled “A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid” in the journal Nature on April 15, 1953—a date now celebrated annually as World DNA Day.\n\nThey proposed that DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder, whose outer “rails” are made of sugar and phosphate molecules. Each rung of the ladder is formed by two of the four chemical bases of DNA: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. They explained that enzymes inside the cell can cut this twisted ladder down the middle and use bases inside the cell to create two new DNA molecules from one. This discovery revealed how genetic information is encoded, replicated, and transmitted. It opened a new dimension in biology, enabling an understanding of genetic inheritance, protein synthesis, and revolutionary developments such as monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment. For this discovery, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Their findings laid the foundation for modern genetics, genomics, and computational biology. At the time, they famously said, “We have discovered the secret of life.”\n\nAlthough DNA was discovered in 1869, scientists learned that it forms the genetic material of cells only in 1943. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery until 1953. Watson’s discovery paved the way for technologies such as identifying disease-causing genetic mutations, engineering genetically modified crops (GM crops), and today’s highly precise genome-editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. Jim’s contribution to laying the foundations of the ongoing revolution in industry, medicine, and agriculture—through genomics, genome editing, systems biology, and the application of artificial intelligence to the code of life—is unforgettable.\n\nDr Watson eventually moved from Cambridge, England, to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he accepted an appointment as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Harvard in 1955. He had a sharp eye for talent among undergraduate and graduate students and helped many of them, including several women such as Dr Hopkins, launch notable research careers. According to Dr Hopkins, Dr Watson was an inspiring teacher, although he tended to mumble at the blackboard with his back to the class. She said, “It was a lot of fun to be with him,” but noted that “he was easily annoyed, and if annoyed he would turn and walk away mid-sentence.”\n\nFrom 1956 to 1976, he advanced molecular biology research in Harvard University’s Biology Department. Beginning in 1968, he spent nearly 35 years as Director, President, and Chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), playing a key role in elevating the institution’s funding and scientific output to world-class levels. Dr Watson first visited CSHL in 1948 for meetings with colleagues on bacteriophage genetics. When he was appointed to lead the institution in 1968, the lab had lost much of its earlier reputation. Bruce Stillman, President of CSHL, evaluated Watson’s work by stating, “The explanation of the double-helix structure is one of the three greatest discoveries in biology, alongside the discoveries of Mendel and Darwin.”\n\nAfter discovering the structure of DNA, Watson wrote the molecular biology textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965) and his bestselling book The Double Helix (1968), which highlighted his personal experiences and conflicts. The book was immediately acclaimed as a classic in science literature. The Library of Congress placed it on its list of America’s most important literary works.\n\nWatson is known not only for the discovery of DNA’s structure but also for his role in initiating and advancing the Human Genome Project (HGP). He was instrumental in establishing the project between 1988 and 1992, and the full mapping of the human genome was completed in 2003. In 2000, a “working draft” containing the three billion letters of the human genetic code was completed. This achievement was celebrated in televised announcements from the White House by President Bill Clinton and from 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nDr Watson left the project in 1992 due to disagreements over the patenting of genes. He was strongly opposed to patenting the blueprint of life. One of his sons was diagnosed with schizophrenia at a young age, which further motivated Watson to pursue genetic research in the hope of helping him.\n\nIn sharp contrast to James Watson’s—Jim’s—scientific brilliance are the serious ethical questions and controversial remarks that marred his public image. In explaining the structure of DNA, Watson and Crick used data and concepts collected by Rosalind Franklin and her colleagues at King’s College London. It is widely alleged that Watson and Crick used this data—particularly Franklin’s “Photo 51” and her research progress reports—without her permission or proper acknowledgment. Franklin was not eligible for the Nobel Prize because she had died of ovarian cancer four years earlier at the age of 37. In The Double Helix, Watson portrayed Franklin negatively and downplayed her contributions. His misogynistic treatment of Franklin raised deep questions about his ethical stance in science and society.\n\nWatson’s acclaimed life was further tarnished by racist and classist remarks. In 2007, he told London’s The Sunday Times Magazine that he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa because all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is not the same as ours.” He insisted that differences in average IQ between Black and White populations were due to genetic causes. Following these comments, the CSHL Board of Trustees suspended him in 2007, and he resigned as Chancellor. When he repeated his racist views in a 2019 documentary, CSHL revoked all his honorary titles and severed all ties with him. The institution called his comments “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science.” Such total isolation of a scientist from an institution he helped build is rare and unprecedented.\n\nIn addition, Watson advocated for genetic “treatment” of personal characteristics such as obesity and beauty. He once said, “Whenever you interview fat people, you feel bad because you know you’re not going to hire them.” These statements sparked widespread global condemnation. Claiming that the controversies had made him an “unperson” and hoping to raise funds for research, Watson auctioned his Nobel medal in 2014. He was the first living Nobel laureate to do so. The medal was sold for $4.8 million. In an unexpected gesture, the buyer—Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov—later returned the medal to Watson.\n\nWhen judging James Watson, a sharp dichotomy emerges between his monumental scientific contributions and his deeply flawed ethical conduct. He was one of the architects of modern genetics, whose work forever changed the course of medical science and biology. Yet his arrogant, controversial, and especially discriminatory comments about race and gender were harmful to society. His remarks are seen as a reprehensible effort to use science to legitimize social inequality.\n\nWatson’s life shows how an individual can reach extraordinary heights in science while failing profoundly in ethical responsibility. James Dewey Watson will remain immortal as the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix. But it is impossible to judge his legacy solely by scientific achievement. A scientist’s social responsibility, ethics, and humanity are also part of his overall legacy. Modern science must learn from Watson’s mistakes so that ethics and empathy are never sacrificed in the pursuit of excellence.\n\n(Tofazzal Islam is a Professor and Founding Director, Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Gazipur Agricultural University and Fellow, Fulbright, Bangladesh and the World Academy of Sciences)", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1659, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:41:34.909435"}

Watson’s 1953 discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA not only earned him a Nobel Prize seven years later but also revolutionized the field of genetics and transformed modern biology forever.\n\nYears later, American geneticist and biophysicist James D. Watson would involve himself in one of mankind’s biggest, costliest, and most provocative biomedical research projects in history—the Human Genome Project. Watson was selected to lead the project, which began in 1990 with the goal of mapping all the genes in the human body. However, he resigned in 1992 due to a disagreement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over patenting specific DNA sequences. He strongly advocated for free public access to all genome data and opposed the patenting of DNA sequences, arguing they should be freely available to the public.\n\nBorn James Dewey Watson on April 6, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, USA, he earned his PhD in Zoology from Indiana University in 1950.\n\nJames Watson’s scientific achievements are numerous, but he is best known for his collaboration with Francis Crick, which led to the 1953 publication inNaturerevealing the molecular structure of DNA. For this groundbreaking discovery, Watson, along with English molecular biologist Francis Harry Compton Crick and New Zealand-born British biophysicist Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.\n\nScientists from many countries, representing several scientific disciplines, were trying to understand the mysteries of life and heredity in the decades around 1900. Studying organisms ranging from grasshoppers to bacteria, they made new discoveries about the chemistry of living cells and the transmission of hereditary information. By the 1950s, many scientists were convinced that the particles carrying this information from one generation to the next were made of DNA, and several began attempting to unravel its chemical structure. The work of Watson and Crick, among others, ultimately contributed to the 1953 announcement that DNA was a double helix.\n\nAs the Nobel Prize committee later recognized, knowledge of the double helix held immense “significance for information transfer in living material.” Understanding the molecule’s structure helped explain how it could copy itself, passing on instructions from one generation to the next.\n\nJames D. Watson’s legacy is complex—marked by his co-discovery of the DNA double helix but also overshadowed by controversies and racist remarks he made in later years. Despite his early contributions, his later career was marred by widely criticized comments about race and intelligence, which led to his suspension and the stripping of his honorary titles from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nWatson married Elizabeth Lewis in 1968. Together, they had two sons, Rufus and Duncan, and shared a life deeply rooted in science and education. Elizabeth, an alumna of Harvard University, was an active supporter of Watson’s scientific and academic endeavors.\n\nBeyond his Nobel-winning work, Watson had a distinguished career as an educator, author, and science administrator. He taught at Harvard University from 1956 to 1976, where he inspired generations of molecular biologists. He later served as Director—and subsequently President—of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, transforming it into one of the world’s leading centers for genetic research.\n\nWatson authored several influential books, includingThe Double Helix(1968), a candid and sometimes controversial memoir detailing the race to uncover DNA’s structure. The book remains one of the most widely read scientific autobiographies of the 20th century.\n\nHis other works includeMolecular Biology of the GeneandDNA: The Secret of Life, both of which shaped science education worldwide.\n\nOver his lifetime, Watson received numerous honors and awards, including the Copley Medal from the Royal Society, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the National Medal of Science. Despite the controversies that marked his later years, his scientific contributions remain foundational to molecular biology, genetics, and biotechnology.\n\nWatson’s legacy lives on through the institutions he led and the countless scientists inspired by his discoveries. His lifelong fascination with the genetic code reshaped humanity’s understanding of life itself—from the structure of DNA to the vast frontier of modern genomics.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Lewis Watson, and his sons, Rufus and Duncan Watson, who continue to uphold his commitment to education, inquiry, and scientific discovery.\n\n(Ashiana Reaz is a biochemistry and biotechnology graduate and a contributor to Dhaka Tribune)", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 741, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:41:36.936251"}

In January 2025, the Tender Evaluation Committee (TEC) declared the offers “technically non-responsive” and recommended re-tendering among the same bidders. Teletalk’s board approved the move, and the Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) confirmed it was compliant with Rule 34 of the Public Procurement Rules 2008.\n\nYet CPTU added an unusual clause requiring ERD consultation — a step not mandated for GCL projects. ERD insisted on expanding the shortlist to five to eight bidders, effectively overriding China’s nomination authority and, according to insiders, violating concessional loan protocols.\n\nA senior government official wishing to be anonymous, told Dhaka Tribune: “This move contradicts the bilateral framework. It risks eroding China’s trust and could jeopardize future cooperation projects.”\n\nInsiders also alleged that quarter with vested interests are lobbying to hand control of Teletalk’s network supply to a single manufacturer, potentially distorting fair competition.

The asteroid is named as 2025 PN7.\n\nThe asteroid is estimated to be between 18 and 36 meters wide — about the height of a modest building.

Scientists liken it to “a friendly runner matching your stride on the same track — close enough to notice, but never touching.”\n\nResearchers say 2025 PN7 has likely followed Earth for around six decades and could continue doing so until roughly 2083, before wandering off into deeper space. Its distance varies dramatically — sometimes coming within 4 million kilometers, or ten times farther than the Moon, and at other times drifting as far as 17 million kilometers away. These shifts result from the tug-of-war between the Sun’s gravity and that of nearby planets.\n\nThe University of Hawaii team first detected the object during a telescope scan earlier this year. What initially appeared to be a dim, slow-moving dot turned out to mirror Earth’s orbit exactly. After several weeks of tracking, Nasa confirmed it as a temporary cosmic companion.\n\nTo date, astronomers have confirmed just eight quasi-moons like this one.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/314379/how-mayoral-elections-are-reshaping-the-political", "title": "How mayoral elections are reshaping the political landscape", "body": "In May-June, the country witnessed significant city corporation elections that bear great importance for Bangladesh's future political landscape. These elections served as a pivotal test for both the government and the Election Commission, as they provided valuable insights leading up to the twelfth parliamentary elections scheduled for January 2024.\n\nSeveral friendly nations of Bangladesh, eager to witness a fair and inclusive upcoming parliamentary election, closely monitored these city corporation elections. The primary objective was to ascertain the validity of the opposition party's claim that conducting a fair election under the existing government and Election Commission was an impossibility.\n\nCommencing with Gazipur City Corporation, followed by Barisal and Khulna, and culminating with Rajshahi and Sylhet, each city corporation election has been marked by fairness and robust competition.\n\nWhile some may contest this assertion due to the boycott by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), it is essential to examine the level of competitiveness in the absence of their participation.\n\nThe reality remains that if a political party chooses to abstain from the electoral process continuously, they, too, bear responsibility for their disengagement. Placing the burden of ensuring participatory elections solely on the Election Commission and the government cannot grant them impunity.\n\nIndeed, none of the mayoral candidates from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) participated in the five city corporation elections. However, it is noteworthy that numerous BNP party leaders and supporters actively participated in the councillor positions during each election.\n\nDespite being expelled from the party, they remained engaged in the electoral process, and a significant number emerged victorious. This indicates that while the central leadership of the BNP chose to boycott the elections, local-level BNP leaders and workers displayed considerable interest in the electoral proceedings.\n\nUpon closer examination of each city corporation election, it becomes evident that numerous expelled BNP candidates succeeded in securing councillor positions.\n\nThis signifies a vibrant and celebratory atmosphere surrounding the city corporation elections. The most significant aspect is the remarkable turnout of over 50% of voters in each election.\n\nDespite the opposition party's decision to boycott the elections and abstain from fielding a candidate, the message conveyed by the majority of the population through their active participation is clear: The people of Bangladesh have begun to place their trust in the electoral system. Their exercise of the right to vote serves as a powerful statement affirming their confidence and faith in the democratic process.\n\nThe prolonged boycott of elections by the BNP has, to some extent, engendered a sense of electoral disinterest among the populace. However, there is a glimmer of hope as people have begun re-engaging with the electoral process through local government elections.\n\nThis development not only signifies a rekindled participation in elections but also reflects the people's growing trust in the current Election Commission's efforts to ensure fairness and competitiveness.\n\nThe decisions undertaken by the Election Commission have successfully motivated citizens to return to the polling stations and exercise their right to vote. This resurgence in civic participation sends a highly positive message for the future political landscape of Bangladesh.\n\nThe significance of the five city corporation elections in shaping the future politics of Bangladesh is currently a subject of serious discussion. Undoubtedly, the importance of these elections cannot be overstated.\n\nThey have effectively conveyed a resounding message to nations with bilateral relations with Bangladesh, especially those that have held differing perspectives regarding the forthcoming elections in Bangladeshi politics.\n\nThose advocating for fair and participatory elections in Bangladesh in the days to come will undoubtedly extend their support to such an electoral system. Simultaneously, this election has further emphasized the possibility of conducting fair elections under the existing government, conveying a powerful message.\n\nThe local government elections have witnessed a remarkable display of enthusiasm and festivity among the populace. With the ability to elect representatives at the grassroots level, these elections have transformed into a celebratory occasion, drawing active participation from the people.\n\nConsequently, if a political party persistently boycotts elections over the years, it can lead to a sense of frustration among its local-level leaders and workers. Such disappointment can potentially weaken the party's organizational structure and detrimentally impact its prospects in future political struggles.\n\nThe local government elections presented the opposition parties with a golden opportunity to gauge their strength at the grassroots level. Unfortunately, they missed out on seizing this chance. Had their candidates emerged victorious in the five city corporation elections, it would have provided them with a favourable platform for conducting future anti-government protests within the city corporations.\n\nHowever, being out of power for an extended period has generated a negative perception of the opposition among the populace. Consequently, it cannot be assumed that their party would have secured victory solely through participation in the elections.\n\nNonetheless, by abstaining from the electoral process, they have been deprived of the opportunity to validate their standing and demonstrate their influence.\n\nOn a contrasting note, the active participation of party leaders from various factions within the Awami League in the five city corporation elections, following the central leaders' direction, stands as a positive aspect for the party. This showcases the party's organizational strength, which is poised to bolster its chances in the upcoming parliamentary elections in January 2024.\n\nIt is worth acknowledging that conflicts between party leaders and workers have arisen at the local level in numerous instances. The disappointment of not receiving nominations has led many leaders to adopt negative roles.\n\nNews reports have shed light on conflicts within the Awami League during the Rajshahi and Barisal City Corporation elections. However, the commendable manner in which the local Awami League, guided by the central leadership, efficiently organized themselves and secured victories in the city corporation elections deserves praise.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent five city corporation elections are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the political landscape of Bangladesh. The confidence exhibited by voters in the electoral process will serve to fortify the integrity of the overall system.\n\nNumerous discussions have revolved around concerns of voter apathy, highlighting the significance of active participation in elections. Therefore, the positive message the populace conveys through exercising the right to vote in these elections holds immense importance for the future.\n\nFurthermore, the Election Commission has showcased its competence by effectively organizing fair elections, resulting in a notable absence of significant incidents. The absence of allegations of vote tampering and the vibrant atmosphere in which people cast their ballots signify a positive shift in politics. I firmly believe that this development will usher in a favourable transformation in the political landscape of Bangladesh.\n\nAll political parties must approach the election process with an open mindset and collaborate to foster a harmonious democratic process, thus avoiding the pitfalls of revealing political bankruptcy through election boycotts.\n\nInstitutionalizing a robust democratic process rests not solely on the government's shoulders but also on the opposition's. Both the government and the opposition share a collective responsibility in this regard. Therefore, by working together and actively participating in elections, democracy can flourish and thrive harmoniously.\n\nPranab Kumar Panday is a Professor in the Department of Public Administration at the University of Rajshahi.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1183, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:43:24.878156"}

A potpourri of issues -- some close-knit, others seemingly unconnected -- produce the gravy that people are offered.\n\nPost-poll studies can be fascinating, and invasive media delight over the factors that apparently convinced choices made. Western democracies usually have abysmal turnouts. Developing countries either have astonishing turnouts, or at least figures that suggest so. What is rarely in doubt is a combination of unsavoury influences on voters.\n\nThe hushed-up allegations of long-distance \"interference\" and subtle, behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, to the more obvious use of muscle-power, brow-beating, and simple buying of votes provide some indicators of how and why vote results don’t necessarily reflect opinion.\n\nPre-poll surveys have often been proven wrong and wanting. That may well be due to a fed up survey group bombarded with a plethora of research beyond mere election predictions or analysis.\n\nPoliticians such as Winston Churchill have waved such imperfections aside in stating upfront that till better isms evolve, democracy is the best bet. Socialism, essentially a dubious cocktail of limited franchise, has tilted so hard towards a new form of capitalism so as to beg a new definition. The two broad forms promise a better life for citizens, without ever acknowledging that several aspects of that better life have to be guillotined.\n\nAnyone suggesting socialism hasn’t improved lifestyles is talking through their hats. Those espousing democracy as the all-do-gooder are obviously under some kind of hallucination.\n\nThe long and short of it is that people never really are left to be where they want in peace. It can be debated whether even that can allow truckers and others to block supply routes over mandatory inoculation.\n\nGovernments are heading that way to fight an enemy that is faceless. In doing so, they have been guilty of misinformation. One of which is whether this inoculation has gene-altering capability in the long run.\n\nIf governments really had got their acts together, there wouldn’t have been such scrambles. From the US, where popular votes don’t necessarily produce a president of choice, to the uncomfortable first-across-the-line process of the UK, the grumbles continue.\n\nFollowing the last elections, the US has bent over backward to fiddle with rules and regulations that broadly support Donald Trump’s specific allegations of \"fraud.\" The UK’s dilemma of a pencil-thin Brexit vote has, in hindsight, raised questions. African elections have hardly ever gone down as acceptable for all the \"overseeing\" of poll observers.\n\nOur sub-continent has been a little better. Pakistan’s elections are considered as heavily influenced by their army. India, owing to its size, passes -- mainly due to the massive middle-class that shapes almost all sectors.\n\nThat Bangladesh is as much a victim of \"influences\" has now been borne out through departing comments of individual members of the Election Commission. Barring the chief election commissioner, others have more or less, and to differing degrees, admitted that they couldn’t deliver the desired output.\n\nThere has been a puzzling inability of all governments, in our 50 years of existence, to enact a law through which the commission is nominated as per the Constitution. The next best has been formalizing what we have had, a search committee to choose the team.\n\nThe current committee's moves aren’t perfect, especially the inexorable hobnobbing with the media. There are arguments in favour and against the process by which anyone can nominate anybody as a candidate. What few have talked openly about is that the commission can only organize, not ensure, proper elections. For that to happen, the commission requires absolute control over the entire machinery involved from law enforcers, administration, and polling officers.\n\nThere was a legendary decision by which India’s chief election commissioner, Mr Gill, prevented a new chief minister from taking office in a state where elections were due. In yet another incident, he prevented the president’s rule from being invoked. Both decisions were based on not allowing undue influence to take place.\n\nThe same powers must be given to the Election Commission in Bangladesh for truly fair elections. Such must it be that administrative posting of those that can influence voting should also take place after his approval. The millions of teachers and such that have been through the nightmare of polling or presiding officers powerless to prevent misdemeanours are silent testimony. They haven’t written any books or given evidence, but such has been the facts.\n\nThe open incitement to violence and fraud, trickles of which emerged on social media, has to be dealt with face-on -- even if this requires new by-laws to be enacted. The 322 plus names forwarded for the Commission has to be whittled down to 10 for the President’s acquiescence.\n\nThe final set must stand up and be counted, if change is to happen. Short of that, the exercise becomes what many are saying -- a laughing matter.\n\nMahmudur Rahman is a writer, columnist, broadcaster, and communications specialist.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 819, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:43:30.789472"}

The last time they had a chance to do so was back in 2008.\n\nCredit goes to all registered political parties in this country that they succeeded in reaching a common ground where all major players could agree to participate in the December 30 parliamentary polls. So this inclusivity in the election in itself is a reason to rejoice, and a very welcome departure from the “one-sided” one the nation had to endure in 2014.\n\nIn the run up to this election, the phrase that has been uttered hundreds of times is “level playing field.” All along, BNP, the party that had skipped the 10th parliamentary polls, has been asking for a level playing field in the 11th version of the Jatiya Sangsad election.\n\nThe Election Commission assured it of that numerous times. But at no point have BNP and its allies under the Dr Kamal Hossain-led Jatiya Oikya Front felt that they have been provided with the level playing field that they asked for. They found many of their MP hopefuls and their support bases in the grassroots at the receiving end of poll violence, largely and allegedly orchestrated by a section of ruling party adherents.\n\nThroughout this journey, since the November 8 announcement of polls schedule, the Oikya Front and its biggest component BNP left no stone unturned to make them heard by the Election Commission. They pleaded with the commission to make sure civil administration and police treat all parties and their candidates and activists equally and rise above “partisan behaviours.”\n\nThey pleaded for not “harassing” the opposition leaders and workers and stopping wholesale arrests of the opposition activists by implicating them in, what they claim, are false cases.\n\nNot only have such appeals and requests largely gone to the EC’s deaf ears, but also, the EC and Oikya Front were at serious odds at times. Written complaints of serious election code violations, and of violent activities kept piling up, but hardly been taken care of. Voters witnessed with rapt attention how the opposition faced a hard time making the Election Commission understand that things were not shaping up in a proper way for the holding of a peaceful and fair election.\n\nAmidst a continuing flurry of allegations against the Election Commission and the way it handled things in the run up to this election, and in the absence of a level playing field, the main opposition parties could hardly manage doing some campaign activities, which were no match for a full-throttled electioneering by the Awami League and its 14-party alliance partners. If pre-poll violence and alleged “non-action” from the parts of the Election Commission, police, and administration is something to go by, there are reasons to worry about the polling day environment.\n\nA general sense of fear is there in the air about the possibilities of violence, intimidation, and rigging -- which could jeopardize the very efforts of holding a participatory election -- first time in many years under a party government.\n\nNot to speak of general people, even the sitting prime minister, who has been at the helm of the affairs for 10 straight years, has expressed worry about “sabotage” being played out centring the election.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, amidst the presence of fear factors none can deny, voters are the only force that can make a difference. If the voters come out on December 30 in their big numbers and express firm resolve that come what may they would exercise their voting rights, it will definitely act as the biggest deterrent to mischief.\n\nBangladesh now appears to be one of the few major democracies where the eligible voting population is in excess of 100 million. Although the number of registered voters is huge, there is a question of how many of them would turn up on the election day. In 2008, voter turnout (over 87%) was far higher than previous elections, but the next election in 2014 saw much lower voter turnout (less than 40%). Of course, the 2014 one was not an inclusive and participatory election.\n\nIf we take the last three “fully acceptable” national elections, the voter turnout has always been over 70%. It was 74% in 1996, 74.88% in 2001 and 87% in 2008. Credit goes to our democracy-loving people that they never shied away from exercising their voting rights whenever they have been given a fair chance.\n\nThis time around, it’s all the more crucial for a whole new generation of voters who have missed out on such a chance last time because of the “one-sided” nature of the 10th parliamentary election.\n\nSince the 10th parliamentary election, a total of more than 12,100,000 new voters have been listed to cast their votes in the upcoming election.\n\nConsidering the number, the youth are going to play a crucial role in determining which party will sit in power.\n\nBut more importantly, they will be the new force of vigilance on election day.\n\nReaz Ahmed is Executive Editor, Dhaka Tribune.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 859, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:43:33.442650"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/149986/prerequisite-to-a-free-and-fair-election", "title": "Prerequisite to a free and fair election?", "body": "One of the prerequisites for a free and fair election, especially in a society such as ours, is the creation of a level playing field in the electoral arena. Ensuring equal footing for candidates to reach out to their prospective constituents is the primary responsibility of the Election Commission.\n\nHowever, without the goodwill of the incumbent party in power, that is difficult to achieve. The concept of a level playing field forms a crucial theoretical component in political science -- and such is undoubtedly the demand of the people.\n\nAnd given the singular strength of the Awami League as the dominant political force in Bangladesh, it falls upon the current government to ensure an environment in which the Election Commission can direct a free, fair, and credible election.\n\nOpposition parties and civil society organizations have called for the ruling party to dissolve parliament prior to the election period, in order to create this elusive level playing field.\n\nDoes our constitution allow for such? Who is responsible for creating a level playing field? All are questions to which there are vague answers.\n\nArticle 123 (3) of the Constitution stipulates the election time proceedings as follows:\n\nA general election of the members of Parliament shall be held\n\n(i) In the case of a dissolution by reason of the expiration of its term, within the period of 90 days preceding such dissolution\n\n(ii) In the case of a dissolution otherwise than by reason of such expiration, within 90 days after such dissolution\n\nProvided that the persons elected at a general election under sub-clause (a) shall not assume office as members of Parliament except after the expiration of the term referred to therein.\n\nConstitutional language is complicated and often open to interpretation. But according to legal scholars in Bangladesh, our constitution does in no way require for the Jatiyo Sangsad to be dissolved prior to parliamentary elections.\n\nIn essence, these polls should be held 90 days prior to the organic dissolution of parliament (which has a five-year term limit), as per Article 123 [3(a)]. However, this does not mean that parliament cannot be dissolved prior to the elections, as Article 123 [3(b)] leaves open that possibility.\n\nThe president, at the advice of the prime minister, has the constitutional responsibility to dissolve parliament, and may do so earlier than the stipulated time frame.\n\nTherefore, while the prerogative rests on Bangabhaban -- in reality, the call has to be made by the prime minister.\n\nParliaments are dissolved prior to election periods in many countries, if and when the incumbent party feels that an early election may bode well for the ruling party or if such is needed to seek the mandate of the population during a period of crisis -- recent elections called by British Prime Minister Theresa May following Brexit is an example of such.\n\nHowever, in the case of Bangladesh, we need to first ask the question as to why, rather than if, parliament should be dissolved.\n\nIn Bangladesh, MPs have a habit of partaking in local administrative issues -- ranging from the selection of OCs of police stations to Upazila-level decision-making.\n\nAs such, during the election period, it is implausible to expect the local bureaucracy to tangibly or tacitly remain neutral in their treatment of and towards oppositional or non-MP candidates. This is the most important reason behind the call to dissolve parliament prior to the elections.\n\nThere may be an argument about a constitutional vacancy in the advent of a dissolved parliament. Nevertheless, the prime minister has already introduced a system to ensure continuity in day-to-day governance prior to the elections -- what she terms as an election time government, comprising of a smaller cabinet.\n\nAs the president has the authority to appoint the prime minister and the cabinet, it will fall on him to ask the incumbent government to carry on up until the end of the elections -- a system similar to that of Britain, where Queen Elizabeth II asks the elected prime minister to act as the head of a caretaker administration up until a new parliament is elected.\n\nTherefore, systems and laws are very much in place in Bangladesh which allow for the creation of a level playing field -- that too without amending or moving beyond the existing constitution.\n\nA contentious judgment of erstwhile Chief Justice Khairul Haque is referred to as the judicial directive to dismantle the caretaker system. Moving beyond this issue, Justice Haque also pointed out that, if needed, two general elections may be held under the old caretaker government provisions.\n\nNevertheless, we have sidelined this advisement. Furthermore, Haque also stated that a caretaker government comprising of MPs may be formed prior to the election -- and wrote about the viability of dissolving parliament at an appropriate time (42 days according to his verdict) and the formulation of a smaller cabinet before the polls, to allow the executive branch to perform “routine” work until a new cabinet takes over.\n\nThe appointments of such, and the dissolving of Parliament, can be done through the presidency. Therefore, as Khairul Haque wrote a verdict which criticized the old caretaker system that the BNP today demands a restoration of, he has also left advice as to how we can form a level playing field with the existing constitutional structure.\n\nAt the end of the day, whatever the system is or whatever constitutional format we have the elections under, in the spirit of democracy -- and with respect to the aspirations of people having that elusive right to vote in a free, fair, inclusive, participatory, and credible election -- our political parties must come to the table to find a workable solution and ensure that our citizens can vote without distress and with choice.\n\nGiven the volatile nature of our political environment and the reported systematic misuse of power through state institutions by those in power, the dissolution of parliament seems an imperative step to ensure the creation of a level playing field.\n\nThe onus is on our prime minister to showcase her magnanimity and political prowess in relation to the future of her party and the country -- she is very much in charge, but she is also very much the one people are looking up to with patience and hope.\n\nMir Aftabuddin Ahmed is a graduate of Economics and International Relations from the University of Toronto.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1059, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:43:35.388715"}

Iha's father, Anwar Parvez, later filed a case with Mirpur model police station in this connection. Although almost three months have passed since then, the police have yet to recover the mobile phone.\n\nAnwar put the price of the mobile at around Tk50,000 but said that more important was the invaluable trove of personal and professional data it contained. He complained that the police were not giving any updates on their progress either.\n\nOthers like Iha highlighted the significance of mobile phones in modern life. Beyond mere communication devices, they serve as indispensable tools for carrying out many tasks, from managing businesses to storing vital information. Yet, despite their indispensability, the plight of phone theft victims often seems relegated to the sidelines by law enforcement, overshadowed by seemingly weightier matters.\n\nOfficial figures revealed a staggering number of lost or stolen phones reported across the country in January alone. However, the rate of recovery pales in comparison, with only a fraction of the missing devices ever finding their way back to their rightful owners.\n\nAccording to statistics from police headquarters, people across the country filed 29,553 general diaries and 18 cases in January over lost mobile phones. The number of lost mobile phones was 29,711.\n\nMeanwhile, only 6,056 phones were recovered in the month: 855 phones were recovered in the Dhaka metropolitan area against 6,843 GDs and 17 cases; 324 in the Chittagong metropolitan area against 2,372 GDs; 58 in the Khulna metropolitan area against 316 GDs; 38 in the Rajshahi metropolitan area against 224 GDs; 71 in the Barisal metropolitan area against 169 GDs; 46 in the Sylhet metropolitan area against 618 GDs; seven in the Rangpur metropolitan area against 160 GDs; and 64 in the Gazipur metropolitan area against 1,075 GDs.\n\nMeanwhile, the police managed to recover 900 mobile phones against 5,189 GDs in Dhaka Range; 979 against 4,416 GDs in Chittagong Range; 299 against 1,521 GDs in Khulna Range; 799 against 2,269 GDs in Rajshahi Range; 221 against 612 GDs in Barisal Range; 301 against 1,045 GDs in Sylhet Range; 288 against 1,355 GDs in Rangpur Range; 402 against 1,248 GDs in Mymensingh Range; and five against 162 GDs and one case in Railway Range.\n\nThose in the sector say most of these cases involve mugging or snatching on the road. Many, daunted by the bureaucratic hurdles, opt against filing cases directly. And when the victims go to the police, the latter suggest filing complaints instead of cases. Besides, many people are reluctant to file a GD as well. When a case is filed, there is an obligation to recover the lost goods, press charges or a final report in court. But for GDs, as there is no such obligation, mobile phones often remain unrecovered.\n\nThe matter found its way to the forefront during a quarterly crime review meeting at the police headquarters, where Additional IGP (Crime and Operations) Md Atiqul Islam said if the number of lost mobile phones had been treated as a property-related crime, the number of property-related crimes would increase. Compared to the number of GDs filed over lost mobile phones, the number of cases registered in property-related crimes was much less, he said, before ordering necessary steps after analyzing the GDs or cases filed over lost mobile phones.\n\nSources at the police headquarters said that at the meeting officials had been instructed to give special importance to the recovery of mobile phones and identify places where stolen phones were sold.\n\nLaw enforcement officers said stolen mobile phones would be sold to shops in the past, and from there, they were resold to people. They said the police used to track the location and users of those phones using technology and recover them. However, snatchers now disassembled expensive phones before selling their parts, which was why the recovery rate was decreasing, they added.\n\nAn officer with the Dhaka Metropolitan Police said the police had recently arrested several members of a gang, including some Indians, who would sell locally stolen or snatched phones in neighbouring countries, and those stolen in neighbouring countries would be brought to Bangladesh and sold here.\n\nThe stolen mobiles would be smuggled across the borders of several districts in the southwestern part of the country, the officer added.\n\nDMP Additional Deputy Police Commissioner Azharul Islam Mukul said the time required to recover a mobile phone was equivalent to that needed to crack a murder case.\n\nHe explained that due to the intense pressure on law enforcement to resolve major crimes, cases involving lost phones often received lower priority.

This is due to the fact that oftentimes, the most renowned World Heritage Sites such as Mahasthangarh, the ruins of the Buddhist Bihara at Paharpur, amongst others, are not properly promoted, which must be done in accordance with the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).\n\nFurthermore, very recently, UNESCO has also labelled the Sundarbans to be under threat due to climate change and various industrial developments. However, under international conventions, it is the responsibility of the state government to promote and protect its natural heritage sites. Inability to do so can result in breaches of several international conventions.\n\nIn times of conflicts, cultural heritage is protected by a number of international conventions and laws. Despite the fact that they have been approved by a large number of countries, they are only binding on those which choose to join -- which is normally done through ratification, accession, approval, or acceptance of the convention by the state.\n\nIn fact, the destruction of cultural heritage sites is considered to be a “war crime.” Each international convention has legal force only within the sphere of its application, which is normally defined by whether or not the states have signed and ratified those conventions, the timeframe it covers, and its subject matter, for example the importance of cultural property as defined by the convention.\n\nDespite the regional and municipal differences in legislation and the fact that not all laws and conventions are not legally enforceable, there has been some agreement. In general, as mentioned before, cultural heritage is protected against any act of hostility under law of armed conflict as long as it is not employed for military reasons at the same time.\n\nThere are however four key aspects that must be adhered to by all states during armed conflicts, regardless of whether they have acceded to or accepted the legal framework.\n\nThe first part includes the obligation of each party to a conflict to respect cultural property. There must be special care taken during conducting military operations in order to avoid damages to buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, education, or charitable purposes and historic monuments unless they are essentially military objects. There also exists the prohibition to use cultural property of great importance for the purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage, unless imperatively required by the military necessity.\n\nEach party to the conflict also has obligations to protect cultural property. It is also further mentioned that all seizure of or destruction of or willful damage done to religion, charity, education, the arts and sciences, historic monuments, and works of art and sciences are prohibited. There are also obligations for the occupied power to prevent the illicit export of cultural property from occupied territory and to return illicitly exported property to the component authorities of the occupied territory.\n\nThe most important conventions which relate to cultural protection are the Geneva Convention (1949) and Additional Protocols I and II (1977), which forbids pillage and destruction of cultural property by invading or occupying forces. The Hague Convention (1954) and its first and second protocols (1954/1999), which is the only international instrument aimed at specifically protecting cultural heritage during an armed conflict and occupation and defines the circumstances under which cultural property may be attacked as well as methods for its protection.\n\nFurthermore, the World Heritage Convention (1972) sets out the duties of state parties in identifying potential sites of outstanding importance to mankind and their role in protecting and preserving them as well as protecting their natural heritage. There also exists the convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects (1995) which allows for the prosecution of individual war criminals for destructive acts or operating against cultural heritage. The International Criminal Court (ICC) has the jurisdiction to exercise its jurisdiction against any party who violates these conventions.\n\nEven though works of archaeology are open for public domain, archaeologists who are responsible for the discovery of various monuments can have its copyright license for an exclusive period of time under intellectual property law. This makes the data collection, video footage sharing, and further expedition of these sites solely exclusive to them.\n\nIn Bangladesh, even though there exists the “Antiques Act of 1968” there has not been any genuine efforts made to amend and implement this act. It is very important for the implementation of international conventions in order to protect and preserve World Heritage Sites such as the Sundarbans.\n\nMashrur Ahmed Zidane is a freelance contributor.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 754, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:44:19.449802"}

On the other hand, it is possible to produce 7,000-8,000kg of vannamei shrimp on the same area of land.\n\nIt took five years for vannamei shrimp to go from experimental cultivation to commercial production in India.\n\nVannamei shrimp farming started experimentally in Paikgacha, Khulna, in 2021 under the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI).\n\nThat year, two companies were successful in cultivation. After that in 2022, 12 institutions were granted permission to grow vannamei shrimp and are seeing success.\n\nThe vannamei shrimp breed is native to Hawaii, US. Commercial cultivation of vannamei shrimp in neighbouring India began in 2008.\n\nApart from this, the commercial cultivation of vannamei shrimp started in 1988 in Thailand, China and other countries in Asia. Its cultivation in the Philippines began in 1987 while it started in Vietnam and Myanmar in 2000.\n\nAccording to information from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the Global Aquaculture Alliance, in 2018, vannamei shrimp production was 3.55 million tons, bagda production was 550,000 tons, golda production was 240,000 tons. Apart from this, other shrimp production was 300,000 tons.\n\nAmong them, Asia, China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia produced 2.391 million tons of vannamei shrimp in 2018. In 2019, the production in these countries increased to 3.112 million tons.\n\nVannamei shrimp was first introduced in the United States in 1970. Commercial cultivation of this species started around 1980.\n\nSince then, large-scale cultivation began in many Asian countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia and India.\n\nVannamei shrimp is now being cultivated commercially in 62 countries around the world. Among them there are 15 in Asian countries. Vannamei shrimps account for 77% of the world's shrimp trade.\n\nAs the price is low compared to bagda shrimp, its demand is high in the world market. Among the shrimp exporting countries in Asia, Bangladesh was till now the only country where commercial cultivation of vannamei shrimp was not allowed.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 719, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:45:29.254200"}

This gives around 800,000 farmers a means of livelihood and each year the country earns some precious dollars by exporting shrimp to Europe, USA and a few other destinations.\n\nHowever, since hitting its historic high point ($510m) in the 2014-15 financial year, Bangladesh's earnings from shrimp exports had dropped to $320m in the last fiscal year. The sector showed some promise of a post-Covid rebound in the first six months of the current financial year, but nothing significant.\n\nIndustry sources say a policy indecision on allowing Bangladeshi growers to produce and export highly productive whiteleg shrimp or vannamei has long been holding Bangladesh from competing in the global shrimp export market, which is a whooping $32 billion in yearly trade. By now, nearly 80% of the market is dominated by vannamei.\n\nFor too long, Bangladesh has remained content with its traditional shrimp export basket of Bagda (Black Tiger) and freshwater scampi, while the whole world has developed a taste for the vannamei.\n\nBy gradually shifting to the vannamei, India has more than doubled its shrimp export earnings between 2009 and 2021. China and the Philippines adopted vannamei  in '80s, while Vietnam and Myanmar also started commercial vannamei farming over two decades ago.\n\nAs the adage goes, it's better late than never.\n\nBangladesh's Department of Fisheries (DoF) is now coming out of its conservative shell over vannamei and giving permissions to companies to go for trial cultivation, but progress has been very slow. While only three companies managed to get the go ahead, over a dozen others who sought approval for vannamei cultivation are still waiting for their turns to come.\n\nShyamal Das, Managing Director of MU Sea Foods Ltd, is Bangladesh's first entrepreneur to successfully try vannamei cultivation in this country in 2021, and he is going for a second year trial next month.\n\nIf his experience is something to go by, the government should allow full-scale cultivation of vannamei in this country sooner rather than later, so that Bangladesh can quickly catch up with its Asian neighbours in shrimp exports to Europe, USA, Japan, and the Middle East.\n\n\"I've got nearly 9,000 kilograms of vannamei per hectare in our trial ponds in Paikgacha and, through further trial and technology application, it has the potential to go upto 15,000 kg/hct. We can harvest it in 90 days’ time, as opposed to 160 days required for rearing Bagda. Vannamei is highly productive, less susceptible to diseases and has a ready export market,\" said Das, also a Director of Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association.\n\nMU Sea Foods Ltd has already exported vannamei to Dubai from last year's trial cultivation. It is now eyeing markets in Europe and China.\n\nShyamal Das said they brought over a million quality vannamei fry from CP Thai and special feed from India early last year. He said if one can invest well in vannamei cultivation, he can expect good results.\n\nPabitra Kumar Sarkar oversees shrimp development work for CP Foods and provides technical support for vannamei cultivation in Bangladesh.\n\nHe said: \"it's not about one or the other, it's not about Bagda or vannamei, rather one should look at this as different options. One can make profit by farming Bagda as well, big size Black Tigers have their own market, At the same time the vannamei option is a good one too.\"\n\nA former deputy director of the Department of Fisheries, Prafulla Kumar Sarkar considers cultivation of vannamei is crucial to cater to the needs of the market and Bagda can be grown at the same time too.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 617, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:45:31.141001"}

Due to this, 95% farmers will be affected.\n\nShrimp farmer Harun Sheikh said: “I have been living here for 12-13 years. During this time, the rate of fish cultivation has come down. I used to sell my shrimps for Tk1,300-1,400 per kilogram, now that has come down to as low as Tk700 per kg. I have two enclosures, each 10-12 bigha in size. The future looks very bleak.\"\n\nZakir Hassan, the founding president of the Barakpur Shrimp Storekeepers' Association, said the shrimp industry was suffering a lot during the pandemic.\n\nShrimp worth Tk1,800 is being sold at Tk800-900 per kg. There is a huge amount of revenue from this shrimp industry. Government support to the farmers is needed to keep the shrimp industry alive, he added.\n\nGolam Kibria Ripon, general secretary of the Khulna Divisional Pona Businessmen's Association and a shrimp trader in Paikgachha Upazila, said the impact of the pandemic on shrimp is serious.\n\nIn 10-12 days, a significant amount of shrimp began dying for unknown reasons. Now the farmers are suffering due to the death of shrimps, not to mention an existing shortage of clutches.\n\nAccording to the Khulna District Fisheries Office, Bagda and lobster are cultivated on about 260,000 hectares of land in the coastal districts including Khulna every year.\n\nAbout a million people are involved in farming, and 80% of the country's shrimps are in the three districts of the southwestern region, Khulna, Bagerhat, and Satkhira.\n\nThe total production of shrimp in the country is 50,000-60,000 tons.\n\nIn the 2015-16 financial year, about 30,000 tons of shrimp were exported from Khulna region. In 2017-18, the production decreased and the export decreased to 25,000 tons.\n\nAccording to the Bagerhat Fisheries Department, there are 69,736 shrimp farmers in Bagerhat, and 61,356 bagda and lobster enclosures in 61,006 hectares of land.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2019-20, 18,046 tons of bagda and 16,336 tons of lobster have been produced in these farms.\n\nBagerhat District Fisheries Officer SM Russell said that the price of shrimp has come down due to the closure of exports.\n\nThe shrimp industry in Bagerhat has lost Tk140 crore in the last one year due to the suspension, which might eventually increase to Tk250 crores.\n\nThe government is taking several plans to overcome the losses of the farmers. As part of this, financial incentives are being given to 26,000 fish farmers district as well as easy loan facility from banks for farmers, Russel added.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 788, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:45:33.186844"}

The opening batsman had called a press conference at his home city Chittagong to say goodbye to the game against the backdrop of the ODI series against Afghanistan and after comments from Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hasan on his fitness. However, around 28 hours later, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took matters into her own hands through former national team captain Mashrafe bin Mortaza and ensured Tamim withdrew his decision. Since then, the southpaw has been away from the field and media. Arguably the finest batter Bangladesh has ever produced, Tamim finally decided to break his silence in an exclusive interview withDhaka Tribunewhere he talked about the retirement saga that had turned into a national issue overnight. Below are the excerpts:\n\nHow have you been since the retirement saga?\n\nIt has been some tough days to be honest, and it is still the same. I do not think I have been able to completely get the experience out of my head yet. The whole incident has been tough on me.\n\nI started playing cricket for the love of the game and later to fulfil my father's dream. It was tough for me to decide to leave this game. To be frank I never imagined the scenario that had prevailed after I called retirement. The emotion and reaction showed by family and friends were startling. The whole incident was tough for me to absorb.\n\nDespite everything, it was important for me to decide to retire. There were enough reasons. I never pointed any fingers at anyone [at the press briefing]. I thought my career with the national team for 16-17 years is bigger than pointing fingers at anyone.\n\nAnother thing is that the decision was not taken overnight. I had been thinking of it for quite some time and I spoke to my family three-four days before making the announcement. I do not want to disclose my struggles, this is something the cricket board should know. I am going to Dubai with family and then to England for treatment. Upon returning to Dhaka, I will speak to my reporting boss in the board, which is the chairman of the cricket operations committee [Jalal Younus]. I want to discuss with him in details the whole incident, the reasons for my decision, the matters which I have been dealing with for the past six-seven months and why I was compelled to call the retirement.\n\nI want to speak to the BCB and not to media or any other public platform. We talk a lot about being professional and its importance and amazingly we often do not follow that. There is nothing called an office secret. We should always have a limit to something but sometimes those are crossed brilliantly. There have been incidents in the past where I have shared a personal matter with the board but those also got informed to the press. This has happened not only with me but many other cricketers and even board members. This puts everyone in an uncomfortable situation. There are times when you cannot speak as you have the fear of it getting disclosed in public.\n\nI will hope whatever discussion I have with the cricket operations chief will remain within the walls. I have a lot of trust in Jalal bhai. Till date I have shared a lot of matters with him which never got disclosed so I am looking forward to an open discussion with him and decide my way forward from there.\n\nWill your meeting be with only the cricket operations?\n\nYes, it will only be Jalal bhai to start with but if the board and Jalal bhai think more people should be part of it, then it is upto them. I always respect the “chain of command”. I am a national team cricketer and my direct boss is Jalal bhai. Anything I have to do or say, it must be through him and the department. Yes, I do maintain a good communication with the board president [Nazmul] as well but I never want to break the chain of command. I will not say I have been able to maintain this 100% but I always try to. But this is not a very common practice here I must say. There is national team coach and then there is Jalal bhai. It depends on him if any other person should be involved here or not.\n\nWho are not following the chain of command? Cricketers, team officials or board members?\n\nI am speaking in general and not pointing fingers at anyone. Those who do it know who they are. This is why I am saying I am not sure how many among us follow the chain of command. Following the chain of command keeps everyone's respect intact. But there are people who often break it and show zero respect to the hierarchy. I will speak to the cricket operations and they can decide the way forward but I will never cross the line and do something that is not ethically right.\n\nAlso Read:The soothing end to a dismal drama\n\nYou had to withdraw your retirement after meeting with the Prime Minister. Can you take us a bit through that episode?\n\nI had decided to retire due to reasons and then withdraw my decision also for reasons. I thought I will have a maximum of 10-15 minutes with the Prime Minister. She is a tremendously busy person and 10 minutes of her time for me is a lot. But my meeting with her went on to last three hours during which she spoke to me personally for around 90 minutes. I shared with her all the issues and the reasons behind my decision to retire. The Prime Minister of the country wanted to hear about it so I had to tell her everything.\n\nHaving listened to my issues, she shared her opinion which I think should not be mentioned in public. I tried to explain to her a bit the reasons why I retired and how it will be better for me.\n\nShe told me to withdraw my decision and I think there is no one who can say no to the Prime Minister. She had her reasons to make me reverse my decision and anything that she says is the ultimate. It is impossible to say no to her command.\n\nThose who know me well know that I am not someone who will easily change such a tough decision. I had a huge number of requests to make a comeback when I retired from Twenty20 internationals, everyone knows that, but I did not change my decision. But when the Prime Minister of the country tells you something, that surpasses everything else.\n\nMashrafe reached out to you and informed that the Prime Minister wanted to meet you. Did it occur to you that you have to overturn your decision?\n\nMashrafe bhai was in continuous touch with my close friend since the press conference. He had messaged me as well but did not call as he knew the situation I was in; he has faced similar situation. He knows well that there is not much to talk about.\n\nThe next day [Friday, July 7] when I reached my home in Dhaka, I noticed he had called me so I called him back. He first asked me where I was and told me that the Prime Minister is looking for me. So, I went to the Prime Minister's residence and the rest, everyone knows.\n\nWas your discussion with the Prime Minister only limited to cricket?\n\nWe discussed many things to be honest. The meeting was three hours long so of course there were many subjects which we discussed. So, there was discussion of cricket and matters apart from the game. She assured me on some things. She knows a lot of things that are happening and I do not want to talk in details about this.\n\nDid you think of the jokes and trolls which you would have to face by withdrawing your retirement?\n\nSee the whole incident lasted 28-29 hours so there was not enough time to think. I was already dealing with emotions. The Prime Minister had told me to reverse my decision so there was no need for me to think of who is saying what and the criticism. I had retired because I had given up and had to return because there was no option for me to say no. We are talking here of the Prime Minister of the country.\n\nAlso Read:The dramatic end of a trailblazer\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion over your decision to retire during a series…\n\nLike I have already said, I have been thinking of this since the last seven-eight months. But honestly, I did not find it easy to leave. I kept on pushing myself through the challenges, I tried to get out of it. But during this series I thought I have had enough.\n\nIt has nothing to do with cricket, neither it is about me not being able to score runs. I have not done well in the last three series but that does not relate to my retirement call. I tried to fight back the situation I was dealing with. But I think I had reached a point where I thought it was enough and the situation had gone beyond my control.\n\nDuring the game [first ODI against Afghanistan], was there any incident on the field or in the dressing room which triggered you?\n\nNo such incident. My teammates did not know what I was thinking, not even my brother [Nafees Iqbal] who is manager of the national team. He got to know about it very late at night and it was shocking for him as well.\n\nDid you meet with your teammates when you left the hotel in Chittagong for the press conference?\n\nWords had spread out when I announced the press conference the night before. So, a few players had come to my room. Many of them messaged me following the press conference. Mushfiqur [Rahim] had messaged me continuously but unfortunately, I could not reply to him and apologized for it later.\n\nIt is being said the BCB president's interview on your fitness might have been a reason for your sudden decision to retire…\n\nFirstly, I want to believe that no such thing was a reason behind the decision to retire. I already said, no one will enjoy such comments but also said the interview was not a reason for me to retire.\n\nSecondly, no one in this world is perfect. I am also not a perfect person. I have both good and bad in me. I have both advantage and weakness in me. But if someone wishes well for me, I think he should tell me that first before saying it to someone else. If I have issue with fitness and work ethic, I should be the first person to get informed. I should be given time and if I do not change then action should be taken against me. But it is never right to talk about it without speaking to me.\n\nThe board president's remark had come following your statement “I am not 100% fit but I will play tomorrow”. Was it a team decision for you to play in the first ODI?\n\nI cannot tell you the whole story behind this but do you think anyone can force himself into a playing XI at international level of cricket? Does not matter if you are the captain or a star player of the team. Suppose the coach said “you cannot play”, the team management said “you cannot play”, medical team said “you are not fit to play” – can you force yourself to the field? Is it even possible?\n\nI could not have played that game if everyone in that room had not agreed. It is just not possible. Now if someone comments on it after taking the decision – I am not sure if anyone has – it is not an appropriate thing to do.\n\nBeing 100% fit and passing the fitness test, is it the same thing? How many cricketers in the world play with 100% match fitness? A player is always dealing with niggles. Sometimes players are on the field even if they are 80% match fit. When I said “I am not 100% fit but will play”, it means I am fit enough to play the game and it has been decided by the team – by those who took the fitness test, by the medical team. It would have been a different story if even one person was against the decision. But it was a team decision – I was good to go, so there should not be any question on this issue.\n\nAlso Read:Timeline - How the Tamim retirement saga panned out\n\nI want to say once again – I did not retire because of the comments from the board president. Yes, his comments were not nice but that was not the reason.\n\nYou have been dealing with back injury for a long time now. How soon will you be able to get rid of it?\n\nI will have to work on it. I have been dealing with back injury since the India series [December 2022]. I scored a century in the practice game and when I got back to the dressing room, I first felt the back pain and informed it to the management. The problem was, the pain from my back was spreading to other parts of the body so I missed the India series.\n\nThen I played the Bangladesh Premier League taking injections but I had to stop after playing 10 games as I could feel the pain was reappearing. I did not take any risk as we had the England series and Ireland series at home and away. I was fine in those series.\n\nThe injury again reappeared recently when I was working in the gym. Now the question should be if the exercise I was doing in the gym was right or wrong. Why was I given an exercise which I should not be doing? Why was I not given a routine of exercises that would not harm my back? We should find answers to these questions too.\n\nYou met the BCB president at Prime Minister's residence. He had said the night before that he was not being able to reach you...\n\nWe had a very normal discussion. I think our relation with Papon bhai [Nazmul] is about cricket and it should remain that way. He is the chief of Bangladesh cricket so my relation with him is like it should be between a board president and a cricketer. So we had a discussion based on that.\n\nGiven the scenario now, people are bound to expect more from you. Is the situation tricky?\n\nThere is always pressure of expectations. Now it will be a bit more, that is it. It is no use to think of those things now. I do not even want to think to be honest. The most important thing now is to speak to the board regarding the reasons owing to which I had to retire. If those things do not change, my situation will be where it was before.\n\nI must have something in my mind which I do not want to disclose to public. Board should know the matters. A lot will depend on my meeting with the board.\n\nLet's say you tried your best but still could not produce the best result in the two upcoming major tournaments - Asia Cup 2023 and Cricket World Cup 2023. If that were to happen, does it worry you that you might not have a pleasant retirement?\n\nNot really. There is no point in looking back now. I have already seen my retirement. I will not have a press conference when I leave the game again. That part is done.\n\nThere can be nothing more honest than the press conference I had done that day. Tears and emotions cannot be faked. It was a very emotional incident for me so my retirement part is done. Now my focus is to try to give the best on the field, say if I play one-10 or 20 games, and leave it for good when I think it is time, but in a very simple way.\n\nWhat are your plans before that meeting with BCB?\n\nI will spend a few days with the family in Dubai and then travel to London to see the doctors. I have appointment with two doctors so a lot will depend on the assessment of the doctors. I will be off for a few days after I come back to Dhaka and then have the meeting with the board.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 2823, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:47:24.072014"}

Exclusively for FP subscribers.Subscribe Now|Log In\n\nBy Sarah Kaiser-CrossBest Defense guest columnist\n\nBy Sarah Kaiser-CrossBest Defense guest columnist\n\nIn November 2015, the Islamic State declared its intent to extend its operations to Bangladesh,threatening: “The soldiers of the Khilafah will continue to rise and expand in Bengal and their actions will continue.” Unfortunately, ISIS efforts seem to be working. While ISIS’s ideological appeal far outweighs its operational capacity in Bangladesh, eight “affiliated” attacks have occurred under the group’s mantle since the autumn of 2015. What do the eight attacks in Bangladesh in the last six months tell the world about ISIS in South Asia?\n\nFirst, that the spread of ISIS ideology to South Asia will result in increasing attacks targeting religious minorities and foreigners. ISIS is rooting its domestic appeal in social fault lines already present within the state. Bangladesh has not previously been targeted as fertile ground by jihadis, allowing ISIS to control much of the narrative. Though ISIS is struggling to retain its territory in the Middle East, its successful establishment of terror cells to carry out attacks abroad will perpetuate attacks by disenfranchised local terror groups and lone wolves. These types of attacks are the most difficult to prevent and the most effective for spreading terror.\n\nSecond, the government’s success in attacking local terror networks unintentionally enabled ISIS ideology to gain momentum. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Hasina Wazed has staunchly denied that there are any ISIS operatives in Bangladesh, laying blame for these developments squarely at the feet of her political opponents. Such claims are a tough sell in light of ISIS claims of responsibility and arrests of ISIS leaders in Bangladesh. Members of now fractured political militias view ISIS as a rebranding opportunity. Aspiring ISIS militants, many of who are former members of local militias, carried out the attacks, though ISIS claimed responsibility.\n\nLocal disenfranchised organizations like Jamaat-e-Islami, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, and Ansar-al-Islam are beginning to take advantage of the benefits of allying with ISIS, including the potential expansion of foreign funding. Since November, Dabiq has devoted a section of the journal to the military successes in Bengal, justifying the killing of “kufar” (infidel) targets. Such “success” likely motivates donors. ISIS’s global success is bolstered by its ‘religious’ agenda as well as its ability to conduct small-scale terrorist attacks that produce maximum results. The nature of lone terrorist attacks lends itself to Bangladesh’s unique domestic situation: a small group of disenfranchised militants can kill a single person yet achieve maximum devastation and publicity.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion is that there is time, but it should not be wasted. ISIS has not yet succeeded in carving out a permanent place in Bangladesh. Policymakers should make great efforts to ensure it does not become an eventuality. The United States should initiate intelligence sharing agreements with Bangladesh and other regional partners to more effectively target emerging terror cells. Equally important, the international community should assist Bangladesh in monitoring elections. This would serve to reinstitute a semblance of domestic peace, reinforce the Bangladeshis legal process, and foster an environment for moderate voices to reemerge. Rather than waiting for extremist ideology to blossom in Bangladesh, policymakers should take heed and help to nip this development in the bud.\n\nSarah Kaiser-Cross is the Senior Research Manager at The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), where she tracks political violence in South and Southeast Asia.

Even though the wellbeing of all living things depends on a sustainable ecosystem, global warming is disrupting this system faster than anticipated, and with unequal impacts across geographical regions.\n\nWhile Bangladesh aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030, the direct and indirect health hazards related to climate change will make such well-intentioned targets less attainable. Unfortunately, climate driven rise in non-communicable diseases and new pathogens threatens to diminish the accomplishments of years of public health effort in lowering communicable diseases.\n\nAs a result, amidst the framework of adaptation and mitigation efforts, an inclusive climate resilient health system that addresses health crises arising from both rapid and slow-onset climatic effects is essential to improve health equity.\n\nWhat are the direct and indirect adverse human health impacts from climate change?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that around 12.6 million people die annually from climate change and environmental pollution.\n\nBangladesh suffers from high risk when it comes to climate related health hazards, predominantly due to being a climate hotspot and a majority of the population being dependent on the primary sector. A collective study initiated by Amader Gram Cancer Care & Research Center, Bangladesh observed the health and economic challenges in the coastal regions resulting from high salinity of water and soil, driven by the rising sea-level, tidal inundation, floods, and cyclones. Their work also revealed how the consumption of saline water is directly increasing, among other health issues, the prevalence of pathogen induced diarrhea, dysentery, skin-eye infection, and pregnancy complications. An epidemic of hypertension was also detected along with risks of respiratory problems from the moldy indoor environments.\n\nFurthermore, the scarcity of fresh water for drinking, growing crops, raising poultry and fish is threatening food security. Salinity reduces farmland and homestead biodiversity, leading not only to dietary deficiency and malnutrition but it also causes greater rates of migration due to the lack of sustainable livelihood from agriculture. The study also links adaptation strategies of rainwater harvesting in plastic containers to a high incidence of breast cancer in the region. The already worsened conditions are further affected by the direct loss of life from drowning, injury, and displacement within the coastal region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that the map of Bangladesh may change from a loss of approximately 11% of its land by 2050, affecting around 15 million people in the coastal region.\n\nHence, a looming concern within this century will be food and safe water security. The number of people suffering from hunger increased from 797 million in 2016 to 821 million in 2018. High atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide not only reduce the nutritional quality of wheat, rice, maize, and other crops but a rise of only 1 degree Celsius can drastically reduce the yields as well. Unfortunately, the entire food chain cycle emits a high concentration of all kinds of greenhouse gases (GHGs)which creates a negative feedback mechanism, and in the long-term can have detrimental effect on all recorded health indicators.\n\nIt is not surprising that the findings of such a study is not exclusive to Bangladesh. Heatwaves have been the major weather-related cause of death in the US in the last 30 years. The outdoor workers' productivity and working hours are dwindling due to heat. Exposure to high concentration of particulate matters like ground level ozone and black carbon are affecting respiratory and cardiovascular systems in regions where wildfire and droughts are common. Changes in rainfall variability and high temperature are altering the patterns and distribution of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria.\n\nThe unpleasant reality remains that the social impacts of climate change pose more risk for the lower-income groups by worsening poverty, inequality, and resource scarcity. While climate change has immense repercussions within the physical world, statistical records also indicate that around one billion people around the globe are living with mental health conditions due to climate deterioration. As issues such as those mentioned above become increasingly intertwined with people's daily lives- depression, anxiety and generally suicidal tendencies could rise to an epidemic level.\n\nFacts which further emphasize the severity of the climate change impact:\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recently reported that there is a 98% possibility of global temperatures exceeding the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in the next five years\n\nGlobally, the first half of 2022 saw $35 billion of insured losses from natural catastrophes which is 22 percent more than the previous ten-year average\n\nBangladesh was ranked the seventh most climate-vulnerable country in the world with an alarming record of 185 extreme events and 0.38 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants in the last two decades\n\nA predicted 1.5°C increase in temperature and annual increase of 74 millimeters of rainfall by 2050 threatens to expose an additional 7.08 million people to significant storm surge damage in coastal regions\n\nAs such we are long overdue to implement adaptation and mitigation processes which will curtail and eventually avoid the rising loss and damage from climate changes.\n\nA question often asked: What is the way forward?\n\nGlobally, health systems are poorly resourced, especially in their capacity to respond to climate sensitivity. The scenario is worse in developing countries where investments in the health sector are even poorer. Although, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) has invested in adaptation projects for cyclone shelters, safe drinking water, improved cooking stove, cooling system, flood, and a combined approach to reduce GHG emissions in Bangladesh, more direct investments in the health service delivery are needed.\n\nFormal documents such as Bangladesh's 8th Five Year Plan and those from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare address the adverse impact of climate change on the health sector. However, most policies, strategies, or plans in both the documents do not either recognize nor do they prioritize specific health issues related to weather or climatic hazards.\n\nYet, experts believe that Bangladesh is already leading the way in locally led adaptations. Hundreds of pilot projects combating climate change related issues were successfully deployed by private sector, government agencies, and civil society bodies. To mitigate the onslaught of disasters some of these successful measures can be strategically scaled up.\n\nAs working conditions for tea harvesters resemble that of a live furnace, warnings of imminent heatwaves which will be more frequent and long lasting become quite clear. Countries such the United Kingdom have developed a multi-sectoral approach to address heatwaves, on the other hand China has implemented heat-health warning system. These constructive cases in points may direct Bangladesh to build its very own heat-wave alert system. Afterall it is essential to employ evidence-based protocols to manage heat exhaustion and heat strokes and use affordable options to prevent more heat related mortalities.\n\nFast-growing and densely populated urban cities, such as Dhaka, especially need faster adaptation actions by the city corporation. From increasing tree cover, parking lot shades, water treatment plants to the use of safe wastewater, green building technologies and cooling materials, the list of mediating actions are endless. Not to mention that a dengue-prone Bangladesh is now in dire need of coordinated disease mapping, early warning systems and vector control systems similar to those of Singapore or the Philippines.\n\nRurally, adaptation measures like building houses on stilts or having retention ponds around farms in low land areas can help avoid flood water inundation and reduce displacements. A noteworthy example in this case would be how an NGO, Friendship Bangladesh, had introduced schools in boats and floating hospitals in communities to build climate resilient char areas.\n\nIn fact, in order to induce life-long behavioral changes, awareness programs introduced at school can instill the severity of climate change impacts on young people. This approach could successfully promote climate resilient food habits by encouraging a greater incorporation of plants and whole grains within the daily diet and at the same time, alleviate the development of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and so on.\n\nAt the end of the day, setting up innovative climate technologies to reduce GHGs is the ultimate mitigation process. Transitioning towards renewable energy sources like wind, solar power and hydropower, provided they are sustainable, can further reduce the detrimental effects of climate change. Since adequate food for the masses remain an integral point of concern, drought and salt water resistant crops could be a game changer in ensuring food security. Whereas, the simplicity of embankments and sea walls can provide physical protection against the most notorious floods.\n\nWhen the question of finances come into play, it is instrumental to remember that an estimated global $1.8 trillion investment in adaptation and mitigation could generate $7.1 trillion through a combination of avoidable costs, and social benefits.\n\nIt is undeniable that Bangladesh will require large funds to protect itself from the wrath of climate change and so the government needs to focus on negotiation processes to persuade major emitters to contribute financially and technologically. Additionally, it has to earnestly explore leveraging the loss and damage fund, address public health hazard in the climate finance space, promote local interventions, and continuously advocate for itself in the global arena for a sustainable future.\n\nMaliha Mannan Ahmed is an entrepreneur and public health communicator.

It is undeniable that, for an individual, substitution of tobacco smoking by the use of moist snuff [\"snus\"] would decrease the incidence of tobacco related diseases,\" they added.\n\nFrench High Council for Public Health shared: \"E-cigarettes can be considered a smoking cessation aid for smokers who would like to completely break their habit. [They] are a tool for reducing the risks of smoking.\"\n\nUS Food and Drug Administration presented fact sheets that explains e-cigarettes are \"potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery for adults.\n\nMany studies suggest e-cigarettes and noncombustible tobacco products may be less harmful than combustible cigarettes, they said adding: \"Make no mistake.

The objective of the roundtable was to discuss the concept of THR, the science-based evidence for harm reduction tools, global best practices, and how Bangladesh can become an international role model by adopting a THR framework in its upcoming National 9th Five Year Plan to achieve the honourable prime minister's vision of a smoke-free Bangladesh by 2040.\n\nHarm reduction is a widely accepted framework endorsed by progressive nations around the world, to reduce smoking-related deaths. The THR framework has proven its efficacy in encouraging policymakers to develop and enact risk-proportionate regulations for less harmful alternatives of nicotine delivery such as vaping devices, e-cigarettes, oral nicotine, heated tobacco products and others to achieve their smoke-free ambitions.\n\nDr Konstantinos Farsalinos, a cardiologist and the most cited tobacco harm reduction researcher, said Bangladesh can become an example in the South Asian region of successfully adopting tobacco harm reduction and pave the way for neighbouring countries.\n\nHe argued that THR should be “actively endorsed as the solution” to achieve a smoke-free Bangladesh as it is “Bangladesh's last and only option.” The THR framework addresses the key causes of smoking related health issues by focusing on eliminating combustion and the harmful effects of smoke and tar.\n\nDr Marewa Glover, director at the Centre for Research Excellence: Indigenous Sovereignty and Smoking, shared insights on New Zealand's experience with the reduction of smoking. She stressed the importance of education as the first step, as smoking is highly addictive and simply urging individuals to quit is insufficient.\n\nShe advocated for a holistic perspective, and the importance of comparing relative risks; focusing on where the harm is greatest. Furthermore, she mentioned that solutions like vaping have been around for 20 years with very little evidence of harm, suggesting that longer-term reduced-risk products like vapes should be considered.\n\nAs Dr Delon Human, a former secretary general of World Medical Association, said, achieving the “smoke-free” status requires a country to have a smoking prevalence of 5% or less among the adult population. Currently, Bangladesh faces a considerable hurdle with a smoking prevalence of approximately 20.9%, reaching 40% among adult males.\n\nDr Human pointed out that transitioning towards a smoke-free nation becomes not only a public health imperative but also an economic one. “According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the UK government has earned £310 million in 2021 as tax revenue from the vaping industry alone.”\n\nHe stressed that “the tobacco harm reduction policy framework should be made part of Bangladesh's macroeconomic planning strategy -- the National 9th Five Year Plan in 2024” as public health policies and economic policies cannot be “decoupled.”\n\nProf Dr Mohammad Mizanul Haque Kazal, secretary general of Bangladesh Agricultural Economist Association said the three key steps to achieving a smoke-free Bangladesh are agricultural product diversification, increasing social awareness and support, and implementing proper regulations.”\n\nProf Dr Lutful Hassan, Vice-Chancellor, Bangladesh Agricultural University said, “Vaping or e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than the traditional cigarettes.” But he insisted on conducting further research to see how vaping can be implemented and how the government may regulate it.\n\nMajor Dr AKM Mahbubul Haque (retd) emphasized that relying solely on legislation is insufficient to tackle this issue. We need a comprehensive approach which encompasses broader social interventions to effectively combat this crisis. He said, “We need smoke-free households, peer support, and social awareness. I believe local public health advocates, doctors and experts need to play a crucial role to help consumers in their quitting journey.”\n\nProf Dr Md Abdur Razzaque, Director (Research), Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University Research System said, “The government must focus on the science-based evidence before taking any decision.”\n\nMasud-Uz-Zaman, Convener, Voice of Vapers Bangladesh drew from his personal experience on quitting smoking and said, “Vaping should be encouraged for people to stop smoking.”\n\nProf Dr AKM Zakir Hossain Vice-Chancellor -- KAU, reiterated the need for sensible policies, product safety standards, social and cultural awareness, and a progressive framework of government regulations for less harmful alternatives like vapes, oral nicotine and others to ensure the protection of public health.\n\nSyed Zain Al-Mahmood, Executive Director, Center for Communication Action Bangladesh moderated the roundtable discussion.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 739, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:48:09.882003"}

Recognizing the urgent need to address this public health crisis, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has set a bold vision to make Bangladesh smoke-free by 2040.\n\nAchieving this ambitious goal requires innovative strategies and evidence-based policies, and one approach that has shown remarkable success in many countries is the adoption of Tobacco Harm Reduction framework.\n\nTobacco Harm Reduction (THR) is a public health strategy aimed at reducing or minimizing the health risks associated with the use of conventional tobacco products. Harm reduction recognizes that, while the preferred goal is abstinence, this is not always achievable. Helping people change to less harmful alternatives is a more effective approach.\n\nPeople smoke primarily because they are addicted to nicotine, but it is the other toxins in tobacco smoke that cause most of the harm. Nicotine can be obtained from a range of products, which vary in their level of harm and addictiveness. This “spectrum of harm” ranges from conventional combustible tobacco (cigarettes) at the top as most harmful, followed by heated tobacco products/heat not burn (about 60-65% less harmful than cigarettes), vapes/e-cigarettes (95% less harmful than cigarettes), oral nicotine pouches (99% less harmful than cigarettes), and medicinal nicotine (nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT) at the bottom, as the least harmful form.\n\nMany progressive nations, including the UK, Sweden, New Zealand, and Canada, are encouraging the use of RRPs by regulating them through risk-proportionate regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe harm from traditional cigarettes is associated with the tar generated from the burning of tobacco. According to the Royal College of Physicians, people smoke for nicotine and die from tar. THR supports tools that provide adult smokers with a quitting route by ensuring access to less harmful forms of nicotine delivery. Research by the UK Health Security Agency (previously known as Public Health England) has also showed vaping is 95% less harmful compared to conventional cigarettes.\n\nThe Guardian reported, citing Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), that the number of vapers in the UK increased from about 800,000 to an estimated 4.3 million in the last ten years alone -- helping almost 2.4 million adult smokers successfully quit smoking and shift to vaping. Hazel Cheeseman, Ash's deputy chief executive, said the increase in smokers switching to vaping was great news in terms of reducing harm of tobacco use.\n\n“They can be lifesaving tools for those struggling to quit. At the same time, we can't rely on vaping to fully solve the problem of smoking. The time for government action is now,” she said.\n\nSmoking is becoming less popular in the UK. Data from the annual population survey found smoking prevalence among adults aged 18 and over in England declined from 20% to 14% between 2011 and 2019.\n\nMore recently, the UK government announced giving away one million free vaping kits -- supporting 1 in every 5 adult smokers in quitting conventional smoking and shifting to vaping.\n\nSweden is on track to become the world's first smoke-free country, achieving this milestone 17 years ahead of the target set by the European Union. The country has witnessed a sharp decline in smoking incidence from 15% to 5.6% in just 15 years, meeting the World Health Organization's target of a 5% adult smoking incidence to achieve “smoke-free” status.\n\nOn the other hand, New Zealand's Ministry of Health acknowledges the potential of vaping products to contribute to the smoke-free 2025 goal, projecting that offering less harmful alternatives could help approximately 550,000 people to quit smoking. Former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has publicly recognized the contribution of vaping to their smoke-free ambition and advocated for sensible and risk-proportionate regulations for less harmful alternatives.\n\nBangladesh has been known to be resilient against all odds with the world taking notice of its immense potential -- from being a “basket case” to becoming one of the fastest growing economies in the world. With a practical THR framework in place in its macroeconomic policies, Bangladesh too, can become a global role model yet again by achieving the honourable prime minister's vision of a Smoke-Free Bangladesh by 2040.\n\nDr Delon Human is a physician and a former secretary general of the World Medical Association (WMA) and a former adviser on global public health strategies to three Directors-General of the WHO and to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 730, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:48:12.842809"}

In a resounding testament to their unwavering commitment to public health, Sweden is on the verge of becoming the first smoke-free nation in Europe, surpassing the European Union's target date by an astounding 17 years.\n\nAccording to the European Network for Smoking and Tobacco Prevention (ENSP) and the World Health Organization (WHO), a country earns the coveted “smoke-free” status when the percentage of adult smokers dwindles below 5% of the population. In 2023, Sweden is set to achieve this momentous milestone, thanks to a comprehensive and visionary approach that has seen the number of smokers plummet from 15% to an impressive 5.6% over the past 15 years.\n\nCentral to Sweden's extraordinary achievement is the government's ground-breaking initiative of reducing taxes and excise on Harm Reduction (HR) products, including snus, vapes, e-cigarettes, HTPs, and more. A revolutionary study titled “The Swedish Experience: A Roadmap to a Smoke-free Society,” authored by esteemed figures in the field such as Prof Karl Fagerstrom, recipient of the distinguished “WHO Medal” in 1999 for his contributions to tobacco control, Dr Delon Human, former advisor to the UN Secretary-General and three Directors-General of WHO, and Anders Milton, former president of the World Medical Association and Chairman of The Snus Commission in Sweden, sheds light on Sweden's journey towards this remarkable accomplishment.\n\nPresented during a seminar on March 14, the study highlights the profound impact that Sweden's strategies could have if adopted by other European Union member states. The potential to save an astonishing 3.5 million lives in Europe alone emerges as a compelling incentive to follow in Sweden's footsteps. At the heart of Sweden's approach lies a clear emphasis on harm reduction tools, which are regarded as less detrimental to health and instrumental in aiding individuals in their quest to break free from smoking addiction. To facilitate this, the Swedish government has implemented taxes on such products that range from 8% to 36% of the excise imposed on traditional cigarettes.\n\nMikael Damberg, the Finance Minister of Sweden, explains that the nation's tobacco and nicotine tax structure has been meticulously designed to reflect the varying levels of risks associated with different products. Consequently, items deemed more harmful carry higher taxes, while the prices of vapes, snus, HTPs, and other alternatives have been significantly reduced, rendering them more accessible to adult consumers seeking an escape from the clutches of smoking.\n\nSweden's innovative model seamlessly weaves together the recommendations set forth in the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, encompassing measures aimed at curbing the supply and demand of tobacco. However, what sets Sweden apart is its embracing of smoke-free products as viable alternatives that are less harmful. By acknowledging the substantial harm reduction potential of products such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, Sweden encourages smokers to make the switch, recognizing that this transition offers a far superior option to persisting with conventional smoking habits.\n\nSweden's resounding success with tobacco harm reduction policies stands as an inspiring example, resonating far beyond its borders.

Notable public health experts, policymakers, and media personnel gathered at the Bangladesh THR Summit 2023 on May 27, 2023, to discuss the role of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) in achieving the Honourable Prime Minister's vision of a ‘Smoke-free Bangladesh' by 2040.\n\nTHR is a public health strategy to reduce or minimize the health risks to individuals and wider society associated with the use of conventional tobacco products. THR amplifies the value of smoking cessation, but where smokers are unwilling or unable to quit, the use of innovative smoke free technologies, that deliver nicotine without the harmful bits -- smoke or tar. These are also referred to as Reduced Risk Products or RRPs including the likes of vaping devices, oral nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products and other non-combustible alternatives of nicotine delivery. Currently, the UK, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and many other progressive nations of the world are encouraging the use of such products to reduce smoking incidence by regulating them through a risk-proportionate regulatory framework.\n\nModerated by Dr  Delon Human, the event featured globally renowned public health experts such as Dr Derek Yach, Prof  Mihaela Raescu, Dr Kgosi Letlape, Dr Marewa Glover, Prof Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, and other experts such as Michael Landl, Masud-Uz-Zaman, Federico Fernandez with representation in the audience from ministries of industries, finance, commerce, home affairs, and other institutions such as Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA).\n\nWhile delivering his keynote speech, Dr Derek Yach, former WHO Cabinet Director and the person who co-led the development of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) said: “Harm reduction strategies have always been part of the FCTC and tobacco control, but thus far not fully implemented. Bangladesh has the opportunity to translate its economic transformation into accelerating tobacco control through harm reduction. It will save lives.”\n\nDr Delon Human, a former secretary general of World Medical Association and an adviser on global public health strategies to three Directors-General of the WHO and to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, expressed his concerns at the event: “The fundamental principle of public health is to prevent and control disease and premature death. With traditional tobacco control, there is little to no hope to achieve the aim of a smoke free world by 2040. Frankly, this is a death sentence for the almost 1.4 billion current smokers in the world, which include 20 million kind citizens of Bangladesh. How can this message of doom be turned into one of hope? By fully integrating harm reduction policies, science and regulated products into tobacco control.”\n\nDuring her panel session, Dr Marewa Glover, a New Zealand public health academic specialising in smoking cessation opined, “The poor and indigenous people in most countries suffer disproportionately from high smoking rates and tobacco-related disease. All stakeholders need to work together to improve access to smoking cessation services, including smoke-free nicotine alternatives, as has been done in New Zealand, through vaping products.”\n\nProf Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, a Greek cardiologist and the most cited THR researcher in the world suggested, “The evidence is clear, smoke free nicotine alternatives such as vaping products are at least 95% less harmful than cigarettes and the preferred method of quitting for most smokers. Along with oral nicotine pouches, these are gateway products out of smoking and should be made available in Bangladesh within well monitored, risk-proportionate regulatory frameworks.”\n\nFormer president of the World Medical Association and founder of Africa Medical Association, Dr Kgosi Letlape emphasized on ensuring access to harm reduction tools as basic human rights and highlighted the role of health professionals in contributing to the goal. He said, “Consumers have a human right to receive accurate health information and risk communication. Prohibition has never worked in public health.

Compared to our competitors—Pakistan at 19%, Vietnam at 20%, and India at 25%—I think the figure is overall satisfactory,” he said.\n\nTalking to reporters about the US decision, the BNP leader, however, said the full impact of the US decision on Bangladesh’s economy can’t be judged yet as the complete details of the negotiation are still unknown.\n\n“In this context, I believe, the tariff figure is satisfactory when we consider competition. If we compare it with other countries, the rate seems to be reasonable. So, this is satisfactory,” he observed.\n\nHowever, pointing to what might be behind the new tariff rate, Khasru, a former commerce minister, said the full picture of the negotiation process is not yet clear. “So far, only the tariff rate has been shared.\"\n\nWithout knowing what Bangladesh may have agreed to give in return, he said it is not possible to assess the full impact of the decision.\n\nIn reply to a question, the BNP leader said many issues were discussed as part of a full package during the negotiation. “There were several decisions made. It’s not just about how much the tariff was reduced.”\n\n“There were a lot of talks behind this. What the Americans will be allowed to export, what their demands were, and what conditions they put forward—when these details are made public, we will better understand the full situation,” he said.\n\nWhen asked whether Bangladeshi businessmen, who were worried about extra US tariffs, now feel some relief, the former commerce minister said: “I think the 20% tariff won’t affect our export market for now. So, at this point, this is a satisfactory decision.”\n\nWhen asked if the commerce secretary’s recent remarks about buying 25 Boeing aircraft from the US are linked to the tariff decision, Khasru said: “No, but something had to be done. The whole issue of extra tariffs is about the US wanting to protect its export interests. That’s why these additional tariffs were put in place.”\n\nThe BNP leader said it is important to discuss how much Bangladesh can absorb—how much the economy can handle, how much the business community can manage, and to what extent the overall economy can bear the impact. “We must remember, this is not just about tariffs. There are many other related matters. We need to look at all of them together.”\n\nHe, however, said Bangladesh’s exporters may feel some sort of relief for now following the US decision on tariff cuts.\n\nKhasru also said the interim government should disclose the full background and details of the US decision. “Our trade is not just with America as we export to many other countries. We must consider all of them to understand where we stand and to properly review our position.”\n\nAt the same time, he said Bangladesh must work to diversify its exports—both in terms of products and markets. “We cannot have an economy that depends only on the US. We need to expand our exports to new markets and with new products. That will be one of the biggest challenges in the coming days.”\n\nThe United States has reduced the tariff on Bangladeshi goods to 20%, down from 35%, after final high-level negotiations in Washington.\n\nThe White House confirmed the new rate on Friday. It is expected to give a big boost to Bangladesh’s exports, especially in the garment sector.

Wildfires forcing Swiss villages to evacuate. Drought ravaging Spanish crops. As the costs of climate change rack up, a debate is surging among governments: who should pay?\n\nThe question has been in the spotlight amid this week's climate talks between the US and China, where the world's two biggest economies tried to find ways to work together on issues ranging from renewable energy deployment to climate finance ahead of this year's UN climate summit, COP28, in Dubai.\n\nGiven China's rapid economic growth and increasing emissions, pressure has grown on Beijing to join the group of countries providing this funding.\n\nDuring the talks in Beijing, US climate envoy John Kerry said the two sides would continue to discuss climate finance over the next four months, before the COP28 conference starting November 30.\n\n\"It is difficult to argue that countries like China, Brazil or Saudi Arabia should still be put at the same level as the least developed countries and small island developing states,\" a diplomat from one European Union country told Reuters.\n\nThe EU, today the biggest contributor of climate finance, has lobbied to expand the pool of donor countries that provide it.\n\nClimate finance refers to money that wealthy countries pay toward helping poorer nations reduce CO2 emissions and adapt to a hotter, harsher world.\n\nSo far, the few dozen wealthy countries obliged to make these payments have not delivered cash in the amounts promised. That list of financing nations was decided during UN climate talks in 1992, when China's economy was still smaller than Italy's.\n\nNow, some countries are calling for China to contribute. US officials including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have noted that Chinese contributions would boost the efficacy of the UN climate fund.\n\nOther countries under similar pressure include Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, three of the world's richest nations in terms of GDP per capita.\n\nSo far, China has resisted calls that could group it alongside wealthy nations.\n\nIn a meeting with Kerry on Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang stressed that developed countries should deliver their unfulfilled climate finance commitments and take the lead in cutting emissions, according to Li's office. He suggested developing countries could make contributions \"within their capabilities.\"\n\nThat resistance suggests the effort faces serious challenges. Changing the official UN donor list would require international consensus.\n\n\"There is much too much resistance among countries like China and Saudi Arabia to touch the official definition,\" one EU official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAdvocates for the change argue that an expansion needs to happen before a new - and, likely, far bigger - UN target for climate finance kicks in after 2025. Countries still need to negotiate the size of that target and who will contribute to it.\n\n\"All countries that are able, must contribute to global climate finance,\" said Ambassador Pa'olelei Luteru, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\nThe bigger issue, Luteru said, is which of the poor and most vulnerable countries will be in line to receive it.\n\nThe UN climate financing arrangement is based on the principle that rich countries have a greater responsibility to tackle climate change, because they have contributed the bulk of the CO2 emissions heating the planet since the industrial revolution.\n\nThe United States' historical CO2 emissions are bigger than those of any other country, but China today is the world's biggest CO2 emitter in terms of pollution produced each year.\n\nCountries will face the question of historical responsibility at COP28, as they aim to launch a new fund to compensate vulnerable states for costs already being incurred in climate-fuelled natural disasters.\n\nThe EU dropped its years-long resistance to that fund last year, but on the condition that a larger group of countries pay into it. Countries have not yet decided who will contribute.\n\nThe United States has been cagey about making payments that could be seen as reparations for climate change.\n\nSome countries not obliged to contribute to UN climate funds have done so anyway, including South Korea and Qatar. Others have begun channelling aid through other channels.\n\nChina launched the South-South Climate Cooperation fund in 2015 to help least developed countries' tackle climate issues, and so far has delivered about 10% of the $3.1 billion pledged, according to think tank E3G.\n\nThat is a fraction of the hundreds of billions that Beijing is spending on its Belt and Road Initiative, backing projects including oil pipelines and ports.\n\nSuch arrangements allow countries to contribute without obligation, although if done outside of UN funds they can face less stringent criteria for public reporting - making it harder to track where the money is going and how much is paid.\n\nByford Tsang, a senior policy advisor at E3G, said a Chinese offer of more climate finance would be a \"win-win\" for Beijing. \"It would earn China diplomatic clout, and pressure Western donors to raise their stakes on climate finance,\" he said.\n\nSome vulnerable countries, frustrated with the flagging finance to date, are looking to new sources for cash. The Barbados-led Bridgetown Initiative is pushing for a revamp of multilateral development banks so they can offer more support for climate projects.

While Bangladesh has made strides in literacy, the nation now requires inclusive dialogue and strategic action to address its contemporary challenges.\n\nTo revive its historical legacy, Bangladesh must embark on a comprehensive social, political, intellectual, and cultural renaissance. This revival would not only inspire pride but also pave the way for progress.\n\nAchieving this vision necessitates the establishment of a well-functioning civil society to foster social enterprise, economic resilience, and environmental stewardship.\n\nThe dissemination of knowledge and the cultivation of strong moral character are essential in empowering individuals to contribute meaningfully to society.\n\nInstitutions like Brac and Grameen Bank have already shown the transformative potential of grassroots initiatives, empowering millions through education, microfinance, and skills development.\n\nA robust civil society can build on these foundations, acting as the eyes and ears of the people while bridging the gaps between the government and citizens.\n\nThrough community engagement, an active civil society can amplify the voices of marginalized groups, ensuring their inclusion in the nation’s development.\n\nFurthermore, it can nurture a culture of lifelong learning, particularly through digital literacy initiatives, thereby unlocking the economic potential of individuals and enabling their meaningful contributions to society.\n\nDespite Bangladesh’s economic achievements, such as its thriving ready-made garment industry and rapid digitalization, significant gaps remain in access to quality education, particularly for rural and marginalized communities.\n\nThe country urgently requires more effective sharing of information, skills, and expertise across all segments of society. While initiatives likeDigital Bangladeshlooked to have empowered urban youth with technological skills, a more inclusive educational infrastructure is needed to bridge the urban-rural divide and promote lifelong learning.\n\nTo achieve this, civil society organizations (CSOs) can collaborate with the government and private sector to develop capacity-building programs, provide access to modern teaching tools, and advocate for equitable policies.\n\nTackling systemic issues such as gender disparities, high dropout rates and outdated curricula is essential for sustainable progress. Moreover, ensuring campuses are free from political interference and violence will foster a conducive learning environment.\n\nWhile knowledge equips individuals with skills, character shapes the moral and ethical foundation necessary for sustainable development.\n\nCore values such as honesty, integrity, empathy, and responsibility are vital for building a cohesive and just society, ultimately leading to much-needed national solidarity, orAsabaiya.\n\nBuilding a strong national character is particularly vital for Bangladesh, where corruption and socio-economic inequality remain significant challenges.\n\nAddressing these issues requires collaboration between educational institutions, religious organizations, and community initiatives on crucial issues to nurture future generations to prioritize the collective good over individual gain.\n\nIncorporating value-based education into early childhood, school, and religious curricula, coupled with nationwide parenting programs, can instil civic responsibility and ethical behaviour from an early age.\n\nCivil society serves as a critical watchdog, ensuring that public and private institutions adhere to ethical standards. Promoting transparency and holding leaders accountable require cultivating a culture of integrity and service to others, rather than self-enrichment.\n\nAn active civil society raises awareness of ethical issues, combats corruption, and fosters a sense of social responsibility, thereby laying the groundwork for a fairer and more equitable society.\n\nRead, in the name of your Lord Who created -- Qur’an 96:1\n\nBook clubs across the country can play a pivotal role, not only in fostering better reading habits among citizens but also in reviving an appreciation for Bangladesh’s rich history and heritage.\n\nBy bringing these elements to the forefront of national interest, book clubs can inspire citizens to share a meaningful future in the contemporary world.\n\nThese clubs go beyond being mere spaces for reading -- they are powerful catalysts for intellectual and cultural awakening. Through thoughtful planning and engaging content, book clubs can ignite grassroots movements that empower individuals to realize their transformative potential.\n\nRooted in collective learning and critical discourse, they can instil a sense of purpose and aspiration, motivating people to aim higher and contribute to a brighter future.\n\nBook clubs are instrumental in promoting critical thinking, disseminating ideas at the grassroots level, fostering dialogue and tolerance, reviving historical and cultural awareness, encouraging leadership and activism and strengthening community bonds.\n\nInitially, they can be piloted in selected urban and rural areas to test models and refine strategies. For greater impact, they should evolve into a national program with clear objectives and structured frameworks.\n\nTo be truly effective, book clubs must prioritize young people, focusing on their self-development and leadership potential. They should emphasize topics of pressing importance, such as social justice, political ethics, and global challenges such as climate change.\n\nBy connecting participants nationwide -- whether through virtual or in-person discussions, author interactions, debates or workshops -- and collaborating with schools and universities, book clubs can even be integrated into national curricula.\n\nWith a well-executed plan and determined effort, this initiative can unlock significant opportunities. Partnerships with libraries, publishers and NGOs, along with active engagement from educators, local leaders and cultural groups, would further amplify its impact.\n\nThe reading habits of a population are a cornerstone of its intellectual and ethical growth. As Cicero aptly observed, “A room without books is like a body without a soul.”\n\nThe progress of a nation is fundamentally rooted in the empowerment of its people through knowledge and strong moral character. Bangladesh stands at a pivotal crossroads where the synergy between knowledge dissemination and character building can significantly accelerate its path toward rapid and sustainable development.\n\nAn effective civil society, serving as a mediator, advocate, and implementer of these principles, is essential for fostering inclusive growth and national advancement.\n\nBangladesh’s potential for prosperity lies in its ability to harness the collective power of its people’s intellect and values. By cultivating a culture of continuous learning and ethical behaviour, and by leveraging the influence of a vibrant and active civil society, the nation can address its challenges and achieve holistic progress within a generation.\n\nThis vision required every citizen to see themselves not merely as beneficiaries of progress but as active contributors to a brighter and more equitable future.\n\nThrough unified effort and shared responsibility, Bangladesh can unlock its potential to achieve sustainable development and enduring social harmony for generations to come.\n\nDr Muhammad Abdul Bariis an educationalist and author.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1051, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:54:30.538757"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/360818/becoming-a-more-effective-diaspora", "title": "Becoming a more effective diaspora", "body": "The Bangladeshi diaspora, estimated at between 10 to 15 million people, is a large and influential community spread across the globe. Those who emigrated have played a significant role in the socio-cultural and economic life of their new countries, evolving over decades into vibrant communities. In addition to their economic contributions through remittances, they hold enormous potential to influence the intellectual and cultural landscape of Bangladesh.\n\nThe history of Bangladeshis in the West dates back to the mid-20th century, growing particularly after the 1971 War of Liberation. Over the decades, the diaspora has expanded as students, economic migrants, and refugees sought better opportunities. This has led to the formation of substantial Bangladeshi communities in global cities such as London, New York, Toronto, and Sydney. Today, many diaspora members have achieved significant success in fields including academia, business, technology, and the arts.\n\nThe contributions of the Bangladeshi diaspora to their homeland are multifaceted. Their economic contributions, particularly through remittances, play a crucial role in bolstering Bangladesh's economy. In 2022 alone, the country received an estimated $22 billion in remittances, which not only improves financial stability for many families but also helps alleviate poverty and enhance access to education and healthcare. This inflow of foreign currency is instrumental in stabilizing Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserves and reducing dependence on external borrowing.\n\nDiaspora investments in Bangladesh, particularly in real estate, small businesses and technology startups, also foster domestic economic growth and job creation. Larger scale projects, such as industrial ventures, contribute to broader economic development. In recognition of this important influx of foreign investment, Bangladesh has developed initiatives like NRB Bonds (Non-Resident Bangladeshi Bonds) to attract greater investment.\n\nAlongside their financial contributions, diaspora Bangladeshis often leverage their networks and resources to support philanthropic activities, such as building and maintaining orphanages, schools, hospitals, and other social welfare projects. Their involvement facilitates the transfer of skills, knowledge and technology, permanently uplifting local capacity in fields like IT, healthcare, and education. Many professionals return to Bangladesh to share their expertise and lead initiatives in these areas.\n\nMoreover, the diaspora plays a crucial role in promoting Bangladeshi culture internationally, advocating for the Bengali language, cuisine, music, and traditions.Acting as informal diplomats in their adopted countries, they also advocate for Bangladesh’s interests abroad, particularly in raising awareness about pressing global issues, such as climate change, which disproportionately affect the country.\n\nIt is inspiring to see Bangladeshis in the West excelling in diverse sectors. The Bangladeshi-American structural engineer, Fazlur Rahman Khan (1929 - 1982), who pioneered the development of high-rise buildings is a prime example of exceptional talent.\n\nHowever, despite these successes, many younger members of the diaspora are losing their connection and affinity with their ancestral land. A variety of factors contribute to this, including the cultural gap, Bangladesh’s relatively poor image in the West, and negative experiences such as corruption or feelings of unwelcomeness during infrequent visits. Addressing these issues can help reconnect the younger generations, making them invaluable assets to Bangladesh’s progress.\n\nThe younger generation’s contributions will be even more effective if they achieve greater academic success in Western institutions while serving as role models of integrity, empathy, and civic engagement. By excelling in their personal conduct, professional achievements, and values, they can improve their social mobility and, in turn, contribute more meaningfully to their homeland.\n\nWhile the economic and cultural contributions of the Bangladeshi diaspora are well-recognized, their potential to drive an intellectual renaissance in Bangladesh remains largely untapped. With access to advanced education, research opportunities, and global networks, they are uniquely positioned to influence Bangladesh's development in profound ways.\n\nA key avenue for their involvement is education and capacity building. Successful diaspora academics and professionals can transfer knowledge, collaborate on research projects, and mentor emerging scholars in Bangladesh, thereby strengthening the country’s educational infrastructure and fostering innovation.\n\nAnother important area is innovation and entrepreneurship. By investing in technological and business startups, the diaspora can drive entrepreneurial growth and creativity. Through mentorship, they can guide aspiring entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, raising the country’s intellectual and economic capital.\n\nAdditionally, the diaspora can contribute to social and cultural initiatives that enhance Bangladesh’s social capital, enriching its societal fabric and driving overall progress.\n\nThe diaspora also has the potential to shape public discourse in Bangladesh by sharing perspectives on democracy, human rights, and social justice. By enriching media, literature, and art, they can influence younger generations, who are often more receptive to new ideas and critical thinking.\n\nAdditionally, sharing their experiences with different governance models and legal frameworks from the West can provide valuable insights to help Bangladesh tackle issues like inefficiency and social inequality.\n\nThe rise of post-9/11 Islamophobia and the unrelenting growth of far-right political and media discourse against non-indigenous populations has exposed social fractures in many Western countries. In response, many Bangladeshis are turning towards their ethnic and religious roots.\n\nThis intellectual renaissance has the potential to propel Bangladesh toward a future rich in knowledge, culture, and global influence. As Bangladesh continues to evolve on the world stage, the partnership between the homeland and its diaspora will be crucial in unlocking the country's full potential.\n\nDr Muhammad Abdul Bariis an Educationalist and Author.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 856, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:54:32.386584"}

But the forest itself is often at the receiving end of the damage, with Remal itself resulting in forests covering 11km getting badly damaged, far too many carcasses of animals and their habitats becoming inundated if not washed away completely -- it is estimated that the damage caused by Remal is three times more than what Amphan had resulted in four years ago.\n\nDespite its classification as a “World Heritage in danger,” the government’s lack of proper care towards the Sundarbans is especially worrying. Setting aside the damage caused by natural events, the Sundarbans has also seen numerous man-made disasters dealing a severe blow to its ecology and environmental integrity -- earlier this month we saw a fire erupt in the Amurbunia area of the Sundarbans, while the images that came from an oil spill almost a decade ago still haunt the nation’s collective conscience.\n\nAt present there are hundreds of industrial projects around the Sundarbans which threaten to destabilize the area. While we understand that Bangladesh is still a country in development, that development should never come at the cost of our natural bounty.\n\nThe government needs to invest all the time and energy it can afford in making sure that the impacts of natural calamities on the Sundarbans are minimized, and most certainly ensure that man-made disasters are completely put to a stop.\n\nThere is still time for us to save the Sundarbans.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 294, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:54:36.095008"}

Concurrently, reports surfaced of another fire occurring at a location known as Latif Chila in the Sundarbans. On Saturday afternoon, local fishermen observed a fire in the forest area adjacent to the Amurbunia patrol post within the Chandpai range of the Sundarban East Forest Division. However, forest authorities remained unaware of the reason behind this deep-seated fire within the Sundarbans; they also lacked information regarding the extent of forest area affected by the fire. By 6:30 pm, on Saturday evening, fire and smoke were observed in numerous locations throughout the forest.\n\nIt is well understood that the livelihoods of nearly 35 lakh individuals residing adjacent to the Sundarbans rely directly or indirectly on this forest -- the Sundarbans play a crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services. Research findings have identified 24 such services rendered by the Sundarbans. The monetary value of environmental services per hectare of the Sundarbans ranges from $456 to $1,192. Consequently, the Sundarbans continue to deliver environmental services equivalent to $27.71 billion annually.\n\nThe preservation of the ‘lungs of Asia,’ the Sundarbans, is paramount\n\nIn the past 23 years, all fires within the Sundarbans have been confined to merely 5% of the mangrove forest situated under the Eastern Forest Division. Over the course of 24 years, approximately 75 acres of government forest land have succumbed to destruction due to 26 separate fire incidents. The repetitive occurrence of fires has inflicted significant harm to the overall environment of the Sundarbans -- notably, vines perish alongside large trees, disrupting animal habitats and breeding grounds, causing panic among wildlife, and damaging the forests. This adversely affects the food chain of forest fauna, resulting in extreme damage to the Sundarbans' ecosystem.\n\nIn the past 22 years, there have been no fire incidents recorded in the Khulna and Satkhira range areas. All 24 fires, including the latest one, have been concentrated in the Sharankhola and Chandpai range areas. The first fire ignited in the Katka and Nangali areas of the Chandpai range in 2002. Subsequently, fires occurred twice in 2005 in the Pacha Kuralia and Gutabaria Sutar Khal areas, five times in 2006 in the Terabeka, Amarbunia, Khuriakhali, Pachakuralia, and Dhansagar areas, and three times in 2007 in the Pachakuralia, Nangali, and Dumuria areas.\n\nIn addition, fires broke out in Gulishakhali in 2010, twice in Nangali in 2011, and in Gulishakhali again in 2014. Furthermore, fires occurred three times in 2016 in the Pachakuralia, Nangali, and Tula Tala areas, in the Sila area of Madrasa in 2017, in Dhansagar on February 8, 2021, in Sarankhola Das's tenantry on May 3, and again on May 4 in the same area. Not to mention the fire from last Saturday.\n\nIndeed, it is imperative to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation to determine whether the fires in the Sundarbans are of natural or human made. Many of the 24 investigative reports conducted over the past two decades have implicated fires left by foresters as the cause of the fires. These reports have mentioned on 15 occasions the possibility that fires in the Sundarbans were ignited by fires left behind by foresters. Incidents of fires starting from beedi-cigarettes or torches used by fishermen and mauls to fend off bees have also been documented. The location where the fire erupted in the Sundarbans is distant from any settlements, with beehives present in various trees and mauls engaged in honey collection. However, pinpointing the exact cause of the fire remains challenging.\n\nEnvironmentalists assert that these fires are predominantly man-made. They attribute responsibility not only to foresters but also to individuals within the Sundarbans engaged in unethical activities for illicit gains, alongside certain unscrupulous forest officials. The repeated occurrence of fires in the Sundarbans is believed to stem from the collusion of profit-seeking fish traders, dishonest forest workers, and ineffective foresters. Despite being a protected forest area, there is unrestricted movement of individuals, including poachers, within the Amurbunia patrol post area.\n\nThe recent fire in the Amurbunia area of the Sundarbans after four years underscores the failure to heed the advice of environmentalists, journalists, researchers, and experts, as well as the non-implementation of recommendations put forth by past investigation committees.\n\nAs environmental activists, we strongly urge the government and the forest department to prioritize the prevention of man-made fires in the Sundarbans. It is imperative that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and held accountable under the law, with exemplary punishment meted out to deter future incidents.\n\nThe preservation of the “lungs of Asia,” the Sundarbans, is paramount, and concerted efforts are required from all stakeholders to safeguard its future and protect the coastline of Bangladesh. To save our future, to protect the coast of Bangladesh, all parties including the government must come together on a platform to stop such fires of the Sundarbans.\n\nMamun Kabir is Manager, Communications and Advocacy, Waterkeepers Bangladesh", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 827, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:54:38.835625"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/342317/the-coup-d%E2%80%99etat-of-march-1982", "title": "The coup d’etat of March 1982", "body": "General Hussein Muhammad Ershad, chief of staff of the Bangladesh army, seized power in a coup d’etat on the morning of March 24, 1982. Coming four months after the election that had placed Justice Abdus Sattar as the new president of the country in succession to General Ziaur Rahman, the coup was a shock. And it was because there was no good reason, other than Ershad’s vaulting ambition for power, for that action by the military hierarchy to move against an elected president.\n\nNot much has been written on how the March 1982 coup undermined the national effort to restore political power to the political classes following the November 15, 1981 presidential election. Justice Sattar had defeated the Awami League’s Dr Kamal Hossain, which was a disappointment because much hope had been there of the Awami League returning to power for the first time after the tragedy of August-November 1975.\n\nEven so, politics was beginning to shape up pretty well in the country. The Awami League had elected Sheikh Hasina, at a time when she was in exile in India, as its new leader. Her return home on May 17, 1981 saw an outpouring of emotion for the daughter of the assassinated Father of the Nation. In the same month, having survived as many as eighteen abortive coup attempts and having dispatched a good number of soldiers and airmen to summary death over their role, real or imaginary, in these attempts, General Ziaur Rahman was felled in a putsch in Chittagong.\n\nThe election of Justice Sattar was looked upon as a happening that would restore politics where it belonged, among the people. Sattar, who had served as vice president under Zia, had earlier earned a good reputation as chief election commissioner in Pakistan. On his watch the December 1970 election, one of the cleanest in either Pakistan or Bangladesh, had taken place.\n\nOnce sworn in as Bangladesh’s president in November 1981, Sattar moved toward taking action against the corrupt elements in his Bangladesh Nationalist Party. It was expected as well that during his presidency democratic politics in the country would gradually come to recast itself as a unifying factor for the nation.\n\nBut, again, President Sattar was unable to curb the activities of General Ershad, who had publicly, in his writing and comments, begun advocating the creation of a national security council in which the military would clearly play a pivotal role. Ershad did not convey his sentiments to the president in the way he should have, which was to do it away from the public eye.Photo: WIKIPEDIA\n\nIt is said a disturbed President Sattar decided to dismiss General Ershad from his position but that move was thwarted when a senior bureaucrat informed the army chief of the president’s intention. In the end, irony took over. It was the army chief of staff who moved to dismiss the president.\n\nThe story of the 1982 coup and its aftermath is yet to be faithfully penned for history. On one hand, the coup was typical of all earlier coups, in Pakistan and Bangladesh, of coup makers seizing power in their self-serving belief that politicians are ruining the state and therefore the state must be freed of their stranglehold. On the other hand, the 1982 coup was typical in that it involved a turning back of the state from all earlier experience of politics in the country.\n\nAnd then, given that General Ershad had his fiat run in Bangladesh for close to nine years, it is important to revisit the ramifications of his coup. Prior to the coup, there was the lack of clarity related to the May 30, 1981 assassination of President Ziaur Rahman. No light has yet been shed on the plot that led to the death of Bangladesh’s first military ruler, though General M A Manzur, GOC Chittagong, apparently wished to speak to General Ershad after the Zia assassination. Ershad did not take his call.\n\nWithin a few days of Zia’s assassination, Manzur was shot in captivity in Chittagong by a military officer sent from Dhaka. The mystery of who ordered Manzur’s killing has never been solved and in the years after his fall from power, Ershad’s involvement or otherwise in the incident was never investigated by the media or by those who replaced him in power.\n\nLikewise, the court-martial of 13 army officers charged with involvement in the Zia assassination has remained unexplained. General Abdur Rahman, who presided over the trials that sent the thirteen officers to the gallows, was later sent off as ambassador to France, where he died in mysterious circumstances.\n\nBangladesh’s history post-1971 will remain incomplete without a thorough examination and analysis of the Ershad years. His followers refer to the upazila system as his contribution to decentralisation in the country, which is understandable. But there are too the negatives that followed the coup in March 1982.Ershad’s attempt to break up the High Court into various segments undermined a core principle of the constitution. His decision to permit Bangabandhu’s assassins, for partisan political purposes, to form a political party and have the leading killer take part in the 1988 presidential election remains a blot on his record.\n\nIn the tradition of Ayub Khan and Ziaur Rahman, Ershad engaged in poaching leading figures from the political parties in order to cobble his Jatiyo Party into shape. Moudud Ahmed, whose political career commenced in the Awami League before he veered off to the BNP, was jailed and then released, soon after which he joined Ershad’s outfit. Other political figures, from both the BNP and the Awami League, were seduced into joining the Jatiyo Party.\n\nThe veteran politicians Ataur Rahman Khan and Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury served in his regime as prime ministers. In a style reminiscent of General Zia, General Ershad created space for some notorious collaborators of the 1971 occupation Pakistan army, giving them ministerial places in his regime.\n\nThis is history which needs explanation in the fullest of details. The Ershad era remains known for the militarisation of politics, for the democracy people expected to return through the election of Justice Abdus Sattar to the presidency being thwarted by the soldiers seizing the state in March 1982.\n\nMilitary rule anywhere has been a disaster. Be it Chile or Pakistan or Burma or Greece or Bangladesh, wherever ambitious generals have turfed out elected governments, societies have gone downhill. Spain is yet engaged in a sustained struggle to cleanse itself of the ghosts of the Franco era.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the good part of the story is that the notorious Indemnity Ordinance, promulgated by the Moshtaq regime and incorporated into the nation’s constitution by the Zia dictatorship, was repealed in November 1996 and a good number of the 1975 assassins were marched to the gallows.\n\nThe not so good part is that the move against secularism, made by the Ershad regime through decreeing Islam as the religion of the state, has remained. It is a legacy of the March 1982 coup which continues to impede Bangladesh’s full progression to a modern democracy.\n\nGeneral Ershad did not fade away after his fall from power in December 1990. He served time in prison once the BNP formed the government in 1991, but then came a time when his support and services came to the aid of both the BNP and the Awami League.\n\nOverall, the coup in March 1982 was an unprovoked act by an ambitious military officer and his associates. Ignoring it or avoiding meaningful conversations on it will not be of help in the writing of Bangladesh’s post-1971 history.\n\nSyed Badrul Ahsan is Consultant Editor, Dhaka Tribune.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1267, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:54:40.650876"}

Many of the islands lie below the high-tide water level, meaning homes and farms are often protected by earthen embankments that are frequently breached.\n\nWith every rupture, rivers swallow up more land and inundate fields with saline water, wilting crops and rendering plots infertile for months.\n\nAnd as climate change pushes up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become fiercer and more frequent, particularly in the last decade, researchers said.\n\nAn analysis of 1891-2010 data showed the Indian Sundarbans saw a 26% rise in tropical storms, with the frequency spiking in the last decade, according to a 2020 paper in the Environment, Development and Sustainability journal by researchers from the Jamia Millia Islamia university in New Delhi.\n\nThese more powerful cyclones bring bigger storm surges which can smash through, or rise over embankments, causing widespread damage, a phenomenon not limited to the Sundarbans.\n\n“I think the diverse environmental assaults we’re seeing in the Sundarbans are also occurring in many coastal wetlands globally,” said William Laurance, a Distinguished Research Professor at Australia’s James Cook University.\n\n“These ecosystems appear to be caught in a vicious vice - between rising sea levels and intensifying storms on the one side and rapid land-use change and intensifying human uses on the other.”\n\nIn May, Cyclone Amphan crashed into the Sundarbans, bringing winds of 133 km (83 miles) per hour, killing dozens of people, flattening thousands of homes and destroying embankments. More damaging weather followed.\n\nWalking over broken embankments on a southern corner of Kumirmari island, Nagin Munda stared down at his half-acre paddy field that had been flooded by saline water in October.\n\n“I have no fish left in my pond, no vegetables in my garden, and half my paddy crop is gone,” said the 50-year-old farmer.\n\nAcross Kumirmari, some 250 acres of farmland were flooded last year, affecting more than 1,500 families, local government official Debashis Mandal said.\n\nIn recent decades, an estimated 1,000 acres - more than 15% of Kumirmari’s total area - has been eroded away, Mandal said, making farm land even scarcer.\n\n“We are not able to stop it,” he said, “The river is eating away our land.”\n\nAccording to the Sundarban Tiger Reserve’s director, Tapas Das, five people have been killed by tigers in India’s Sundarbans since April.\n\nLocal media, which closely follow such attacks, have reported up to 21 deaths last year, from 13 both in 2018 and 2019. Many attacks are not recorded, as families are reluctant to report them since it is illegal to go far into the forests.\n\n“The number of reported cases of human wildlife conflict and fatalities are certainly alarming,” said Anamitra Anurag Danda, a Senior Visiting Fellow with the Observer Research Foundation think-tank.\n\nA new factor behind the increase has been the coronavirus pandemic, which trapped tens of thousands of people like the Mondal family on the Sundarbans when they would normally be earning money as labourers elsewhere in India.\n\nIn late September, a group of more than 30 men left Kumirmari late in the morning and headed into the forest. Their mission was to collect the body of Haripada Mondal, 31, who had been attacked by a tiger during a fishing expedition.\n\nGuided by the fishermen who had accompanied Mondal on his fateful trip, the men first spotted a pair of red shorts caught in the mangrove trees, two members of the party said.\n\nFollowing drag marks in the soft mud, the group went deeper into the woods, wielding sticks and bursting firecrackers to scare away any tigers, they added.\n\n“I found his head first,” said Mondal’s eldest brother, Sunil. The rest of the body lay a few feet away.\n\nThe youngest of three brothers, Haripada Mondal, like others in his area, dropped out of school early to find work.\n\nMost years he would leave the Sundarbans to work as an agricultural labourer in southern India and on construction sites near the eastern city of Kolkata, his brother-in-law Kamalesh Mondal said.\n\nHe grew a crop of paddy on a leased plot behind his small mud house, where he lived with wife Ashtami and a 9-year-old son.\n\n“Life was okay,” said Ashtami, 29. “We made ends meet.”\n\nMondal, the sole breadwinner, returned home from a construction job in mid-March, his family said, days before India’s government announced a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe lockdown halted much of the country’s economy, stalling the informal sector that supports most migrant workers and sending millions back home, including to the Sundarbans.\n\nFor months, Mondal sat at home without work as savings dwindled until, desperate for money, he decided to go fishing on the rivers encircling Kumirmari, Ashtami said.\n\n“He said he would go nearby to fish and make 50-100 rupees to help with household expenses,” she said. He left home before dawn, rowed into the forests and was killed.\n\n“If there was no lockdown or no coronavirus, he would have left here to work.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1211, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:57:25.410664"}

The report stated that the allegations brought in the case were found to be substantiated.\n\nA bench assistant of the concerned court Shishir Halder said, “The court has taken cognizance of the report and issued warrant of arrest on 21 January, 2026.”\n\nEarlier, on August 7, 2025, Md. Salahuddin Ferdous, the authorised representative of Masud & Brothers, filed a complaint with the court, naming six individuals as accused. After recording the complainant’s statement, the court directed the CID to conduct an investigation and submit a report.\n\nThe accused in the case are Unilever Bangladesh; Syed Zikrul Bin Zamir (Cluster Head, Unilever Bangladesh); M. Soaib Kamal (Senior Territory Manager); Kawsar Mahmud Chowdhury (Area Manager); Mohammad Naharul Islam Mollah (Managing Director); and Jinnia Haque (Finance Director).\n\nLawyer for the complainant, Zahidul Islam Hiron, told The Bangladesh Post that the CID submitted its investigation report after finding the allegations to be true, and the court subsequently issued warrant of arrest against the officials of Unilever Bangladesh.\n\nAccording to the complaint petition, the complainant company had been marketing Unilever Bangladesh products as a distributor since September 2009. The distribution agreement was last renewed on January 28, 2024.\n\nThe complainant alleged that between January 2020 and June 2025, damaged, expired, and defective products supplied by the accused were returned to Unilever Bangladesh. The total value of these goods amounted to Tk 3 crore 75 lakh. Despite repeated demands, the accused allegedly failed to replace the goods or refund the money, using various pretexts.\n\nThe complaint further stated that, following the advice and instructions of the accused, the complainant company purchased unnecessary delivery rickshaw vans, resulting in a loss of Tk 1 crore 67 lakh.\n\nIt was also alleged that, acting on the instructions of the accused, the complainant supplied goods on credit to various market entities, leaving outstanding receivables amounting to Tk 3 crore 11 thousand.\n\nWhen the complainant sought recovery of the total claimed loss of Tk 8 crore 53 lakh and assistance in collecting the outstanding credit, the accused allegedly began evading responsibility. The first accused is also accused of demanding a bribe of Tk 70 lakh from the complainant in exchange for facilitating recovery of the outstanding credit.\n\nAfter overall investigation, examination of witnesses, review of documentary evidence, and questioning of both the complainant and the accused, the investigating officer stated that evidence was found indicating criminal breach of trust, cheating, intimidation, and abetment through collusion. The allegations were found to be prima facie true under Sections 420, 406, 506, and 109 of the Penal Code.\n\nThe Bangladesh Post could not obtain comments from Unilever Bangladesh or the other accused regarding the matter.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 518, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T18:58:11.480477"}

There are serious questions surrounding journalists and many media outlets. That is why a Newspaper Standards Committee is urgently needed,” he said while speaking at the Media Conference–2026 organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) in the capital.\n\nAdvising journalists to think pragmatically, Shafik Rehman said relying solely on journalism for livelihood has become increasingly difficult. “Given the current state of journalism, journalists should also consider alternative professions. Without another source of income, it is very hard to practise independent journalism in Bangladesh.”\n\nExpressing solidarity with the journalists’ unity demonstrated at the event, he said such collective initiatives were absent during periods when newspapers were shut down and journalists were arrested under past Awami League governments. “Even so, better late than never—we have finally realised the need to stand united.”\n\nRecalling his personal ordeal, Shafik Rehman said he lost sight in his left eye and hearing in his left ear during his time in jail. “I never sought personal publicity; I always wanted publicity for my newspaper.”\n\nCalling on journalists to free themselves from political allegiance, he criticised what he described as opportunistic shifts in loyalty. “Those who are now speaking against the Awami League were once aligned with the government during its tenure. Overnight, as if by magic, they became BNP supporters. This cannot be journalism. Journalists must come out of political subservience.”\n\nShafik Rehman also voiced concern over Bangladesh’s economic trajectory, drawing a historical parallel with post-fascist Italy, where a collapse in the currency forced people to revert to barter trade.\n\n“I fear Bangladesh could head in that direction,” he warned, citing the proliferation of banks in the country. “The Awami League government has established 76 banks, while a country like England has only four.”\n\nStressing professional accountability, the veteran journalist said meaningful change in Bangladesh’s media landscape would come only when journalists understand why they chose the profession, publishers recognise their responsibilities and editors remain fully conscious of their roles.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 373, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:06:13.823374"}

Shafik Rehman was present in the courtroom during the announcement.\n\nEarlier, on April 27, Advocate Syed Zainul Abedin Mesbah had pleaded for Rehman’s acquittal. During the hearing, the prosecution informed the court that they had no objection if Shafik Rehman were acquitted in this case.\n\nDuring the hearing, defense counsel Syed Zainul Abedin Mesbah said: \"The victim himself did not file the case. The police, displaying excessive interest, filed it themselves. Shafik Rehman is a 90-year-old man. He was taken into remand for this case.\"\n\nHe further added: \"There is no confessional statement in the case. Twelve witnesses have testified, including Joy himself.

He is a renowned journalist.

The judge mentioned in the verdict that the sentences under both sections would run concurrently.\n\nOn September 22 last year, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a gazette notification suspending the sentences of Shafik Rehman and US-based businessman Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan for one year.\n\nAfter Mahmudur Rahman was sent to jail, on September 30, Shafik Rehman surrendered before the Dhaka court and secured bail on condition of filing an appeal against the sentence.

I send money to pay for my daughter’s education and my brother’s treatment. A tax on that is unjust.”\n\nEconomists warn that such a tax could drive migrants away from legal banking routes, pushing them toward informal remittance channels like hundi.\n\nThis would not only reduce official inflows but also undermine the country’s ability to track and manage foreign currency reserves.\n\nDr Biru Paksha Paul, former chief economist at Bangladesh Bank, said: “Remittances are a vital source of non-debt foreign currency. A 5% tax could significantly boost hundi transactions.\n\n“Instead of relying only on incentives, we must offer competitive exchange rates to keep remittances flowing through official channels.”\n\nWhile India, recipient of $118.7 billion in global remittances, is expected to be hardest hit, Bangladesh is among several low- and middle-income countries that could suffer heavily if the bill becomes law.\n\nOther affected nations include Mexico, the Philippines, Egypt, and multiple Latin American economies.\n\n“This proposal doesn’t just hurt migrants and their families,” said Manuel Orozco, director of migration, remittances, and development at Inter-American Dialogue. “It can destabilize whole communities and undermine the US’s own economic and humanitarian interests.”\n\nThe Trump administration had already strained US-Bangladesh trade relations with reciprocal tariffs of up to 25%, and the remittance tax could deepen the economic fallout.\n\nExperts say the Bangladeshi government must urgently expand alternative remittance corridors, enhance digital remittance services, and adopt market-based dollar rates to keep legal inflows viable.\n\nDr Zaid Bakht, a senior researcher at BIDS, added that while higher-income migrants may absorb the cost, low-income workers could be forced to reduce or halt remittances altogether.\n\nSyed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, said: “Around $300–400 million arrives from the US monthly. A 5% tax means $15–20 million could be lost each month. This sends a negative signal to our economy.”\n\nWith a final congressional vote pending, the future of the bill remains uncertain. However, its potential passage is already shaking confidence in the stability of remittance-dependent economies.\n\nAs Rashida Akhtar, a Bangladeshi development activist, said: “Remittances aren’t just money. They are survival. They build homes, send children to school, and keep the lights on.

Medical examinations reveal that many of these children are affected by thyroid hormone disorders.\n\nOnce thought to affect mainly adults, thyroid disorders are now increasingly common in children, doctors warn. The condition can silently but severely hinder both physical and mental development if left undetected. Physicians caution that abnormalities in a child’s weight, height, or cognitive progress should not be attributed solely to malnutrition, as thyroid disorders may often be the underlying cause.\n\nDr Sabrina Jashim, resident medical officer and Child and Neonatal specialist at Birdem General Hospital-2, explained that thyroid disorders in children fall into two categories: congenital and acquired. “Congenital thyroid disorders can be detected through screening within seven days of birth. If treated early, children can lead completely normal lives,” she said.\n\nBangladesh, however does not yet have a government-run free neonatal thyroid screening program. Currently, parents must pay for private testing, which costs around Tk700—an expense many low-income families cannot afford. At Birdem, all newborns are screened within the first week, and treatment begins immediately if abnormalities are detected.\n\nAccording to Sabrina, newborns with congenital thyroid hormone deficiency often show symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, feeding difficulties, constipation, and facial swelling. In older children, iodine deficiency is a major contributor, leading to reduced mental development, loss of appetite, and poor physical growth. “We often see children aged two to two-and-a-half years who appear no older than one year,” she noted. On average, 20 to 25 children with thyroid disorders seek treatment daily at Birdem’s pediatric department, most coming from outside Dhaka.\n\nFour-year-nine-month-old Arwa is one such patient. She visits the endocrinology department at Birdem with her mother from Uttarkhan. Her mother recalls that Arwa developed jaundice at just 43 days old. Further tests revealed a thyroid hormone deficiency. Tests, including TSH and FT4, confirmed that her thyroid gland was underdeveloped and producing insufficient hormones. With regular treatment, Arwa now leads a normal life, though doctors recommend follow-up tests every two months.\n\nSimilarly, two-year-old Abdur Rahman from Barguna was diagnosed with thyroid hormone deficiency at one year old, though he appeared no older than a two- to three-month-old infant. After initial diagnosis at a local hospital, he was referred to Birdem for specialized care. Nearly 18 months of continuous treatment have significantly improved his growth.\n\nDoctors emphasize that the first three years of life are critical for brain development, and thyroid hormones play a vital role in both physical growth and cognitive development during this period. A deficiency can result in lifelong physical and intellectual disability, a condition known as congenital hypothyroidism, caused by incomplete development of the thyroid gland or impaired hormone production.\n\nA study by the Nuclear Medicine and Sciences department of Bangladesh Medical University (BMU) found that thyroid disorders are largely hereditary and not contagious. Genetically, one in every 2,300 children is born with a thyroid disorder. Around one in ten women suffers from thyroid-related diseases, and if both parents are affected, the risk of the child developing the condition rises to nearly 70%.\n\nIodine deficiency remains a major contributing factor. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production, and certain medications can reduce or block hormone secretion. Since thyroid hormones are also crucial for fetal growth, screening and treating thyroid disorders in pregnant women is essential. A recent BMU study found widespread iodine deficiency among school-going children and pregnant women in Bangladesh.\n\nSabrina said all forms of thyroid treatment are now available in the country. Birdem provides comprehensive thyroid care, while BMU’s Thyroid Clinic—operating for over 30 years—has treated thousands of patients. It remains the country’s only fully integrated thyroid clinic, offering services through nuclear medicine and surgical departments. Thyroid treatment is also available at Dhaka Medical College and most medical colleges and nuclear medicine centers nationwide.\n\nDoctors urge parents to monitor their children’s growth and cognitive development closely and seek early thyroid screening if abnormalities appear, as timely treatment can ensure a healthy, normal life for affected children.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 688, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:08:00.475377"}

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/400730/how-music-shapes-the-development-of-children", "title": "How music shapes the development of children", "body": "Children’s bedtime scenes have changed significantly over time. There was once an era when children drifted off to sleep listening to stories, songs, or rhymes in the voices of their parents or grandparents. Sleep then was not merely about closing one’s eyes; it was a warm human experience shaped by relationships, touch, and familiar voices.\n\nToday, that scene has largely been replaced by mobile phone screens. Many children now fall asleep listening to songs, stories, or rhymes — but not in the voices of family members. Instead, they come through digital devices.\n\nAlthough the medium has changed, research shows that the importance of music in children’s lives has not diminished. Even today, music remains a powerful and essential tool for child development. It is not merely a source of entertainment; rather, it plays a combined role in children’s physical, mental, linguistic, and emotional growth.\n\nThe role of music in a child’s life extends far beyond joy. It strongly influences learning ability, language development, attention span, and emotional expression. When a child listens to or sings a song, they are not just hearing sounds. They learn rhythm, recognise melody, experience emotional shifts, and gradually develop the ability to express their inner feelings.\n\nA report published by UNICEF states that music gently engages all areas of a child’s development. When children interact with music, multiple parts of the brain become active simultaneously. Listening, movement, emotion, and attention work together, making music distinct from other learning tools.\n\nWhen children participate in music-based activities, such as singing or moving with rhythm, their verbal interaction increases. At the same time, communication with parents improves, which significantly supports language development.\n\nEight-year-old Tonny from Azimpur in Dhaka is a case in point. Her mother, Parama Das, practices music herself and regularly teaches songs to Tonny and three other children.\n\n“I feel good when I sing. Music practice is very beneficial for children,” Parama said. “Through music, they learn new words, tunes, and rhythms. Music also helps reduce children’s mental stress.”\n\nTonny said: “I like singing songs with my mother. When I sing, I feel happy. Singing makes me feel calm.”\n\nChild psychiatrist Dr Surajit Talukder believes that active engagement with music deepens children’s learning processes.\n\n“When children actively participate in music — such as singing, keeping rhythm, or playing musical instruments — they learn sounds, rhythm, and pronunciation at a deeper level,” he said. “Music makes language learning easier and helps expand communication-related skills.”\n\nScientific research supports this view. Studies show that music strengthens the complex connection between the ear and the brain, creating a strong foundation for sound-based learning. Longitudinal research has found that music-based education can bring both structural and functional changes to children’s auditory systems and other parts of the brain.\n\nWhen children clap their hands, move their bodies, or wiggle their fingers while listening to or singing songs, these simple movements help develop motor skills and body–mind coordination. Music simultaneously supports both physical and mental development.\n\nA systematic review has shown that music education has a positive impact on children’s physical, social, and psychological skills. It improves memory, attention span, language ability, and social communication.\n\nA child practices playing a harmonium. Photo: Dhaka Tribune\n\nKajal Akter, a music teacher at a private school in Dhaka, said: “We practice music with children every morning. Some children are used to listening to songs on screens, but singing together makes them more active. They not only listen to sounds but also learn to express themselves. Music calms the mind and builds confidence and creativity.”\n\nMany studies further show that music activates multiple neural centres in children’s brains at the same time, linking listening, attention, language, and emotional processes. Music is not just about singing or dancing; it supports brain development and lays a strong foundation for future learning.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, musical expression helps children develop language skills, relax emotionally, and improve concentration — all of which are crucial for future education.\n\nHowever, experts caution that listening to music alone is not enough. Active participation — such as singing, playing instruments, or dancing to rhythm — stimulates various brain networks and creates a dynamic learning environment. It also helps children regulate emotions and build social relationships.\n\nDespite the proven benefits of music education in Bangladesh, challenges remain. Some primary education institutions show little interest in appointing music teachers. In certain cases, decisions have even been taken to cancel the recruitment of music and physical education teachers.\n\nThese decisions have raised concern among educators and professionals, as numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of music education for children’s overall development.\n\nJust as people use songs as a language of emotion, science now recognises music as a powerful tool for children’s learning and growth. Music is not merely sound; it helps children focus, learn language, build relationships, and train different parts of the brain to work together.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 809, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:08:08.008885"}

Economists and experts may dwell on issues ranging from micro and macroeconomic stability to structural adjustments, and more.\n\nBut what exactly does a budget mean at the level of the ordinary citizen?\n\nWhen it comes to income generation and employment opportunities in Bangladesh, the current situation is dismal—with high unemployment and low levels of private sector and foreign direct investment.\n\nA budget should be more than a tally of revenue earnings and public expenditures. It should contain a vision and a plan to create a conducive ecosystem within the national economy that attracts both domestic and foreign investments, thereby generating employment.\n\nAnd Bangladesh needs this more now than perhaps at any other point in its 55-year history. If the findings of the country’s premier think tank, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), are to be trusted, 2.1 million people lost their jobs in just the last six months of 2024—of whom women accounted for 85.7 percent.\n\nEmployment conditions for women remain fragile: 80.8 percent are in vulnerable jobs characterized by low productivity and poor returns. A significant portion of youth—both male and female (around 40% of those aged 15–24)—and nearly two-thirds of young women in Bangladesh are neither in employment, education, nor training. This reflects a serious underutilization of human potential—a national loss we can ill afford.\n\nHigh inflation has persisted for over two and a half years, while wages have remained stagnant. Compared to urban areas, inflation is even higher in rural regions, wherealternative work opportunities are limited. As a result, many people have fallen back below the poverty line.\n\nThe budget must include policy directions and actionable measures to arrest the slide of the poor and ultra-poor, especially those who had previously moved up the economic ladder. More importantly, the unemployed youth must be absorbed into the job market—which itself needs to expand through investment-friendly policies and an enabling environment.\n\nWhen it comes to education, Bangladesh’s expenditure as a percentage of GDP has hovered between only 1.5 and 1.8 percent for the past decade—one of the lowest in both the world and the region.\n\nThe current level of public spending on education is inadequate given the country's development milestones and goals, such as graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) status in 2026 and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Beyond the low investment, there are concerns about the effective utilization of allocated resources and the overall efficiency of spending.\n\nIn the health sector, Bangladesh’s budgetary outlay is the lowest in South Asia. In the current fiscal year, the country is spending less than one percent of its GDP on public health. In recent years, Bangladesh’s health expenditure as a share of GDP has been among the lowest across the 45 LDCs.\n\nPeople in Bangladesh must pay for most of their healthcare out of pocket—whether for medicine, treatment, or services—as the government covers barely a quarter of public health expenditures. Out-of-pocket expenses account for 73 percent of total health expenditures in Bangladesh, one of the highest rates in the world.\n\nIf the upcoming budget fails to address these crucial issues of employment, education, and health, the disconnect between budget announcements and the everyday concerns of ordinary people will only persist.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 634, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:09:56.839431"}

Inflation has also increased.\n\nMeanwhile, the rise in interest rates on bank loans has halted business expansion and new investments. Most entrepreneurs are struggling as costs for business and investment have surged.\n\nTo curb inflation, Bangladesh Bank raised the policy rate to 10%, causing bank loan interest rates to climb as high as 15%.\n\nSmall, medium, and large businesses, heavily reliant on bank loans, are the hardest hit.\n\nThe rate of opening letters of credit (LCs) has dropped by 7%, and production has fallen by 25% to 40%.\n\nThe economy, already battered by money laundering, corruption, mismanagement, and plundering during the previous government, shows no signs of recovery.\n\nIn the five months since the interim government took charge, the fall in foreign currency reserves has been halted.\n\nHowever, trade remains stagnant, industries are marred by labor unrest, and negative trends in investment and employment persist.\n\nParticularly in July and August, economic activities were severely disrupted. Food inflation surpassed 14% in July.\n\nFactories experienced incidents of vandalism and arson in August, followed by widespread floods. For months, industrial zones have faced unrest over demands for wage increases.\n\nYet, there is positive news in remittances. December saw a record $2.64 billion in remittances, the highest in the country’s history.\n\nExports have also seen growth. In December, goods exports brought in $4.627 billion, a 17.72% year-on-year increase, improving foreign currency reserve conditions.\n\nBy year-end, total reserves rose to $21 billion.\n\nThe interim government has reduced import duties and taxes on essentials like rice and edible oil and taken measures such as lowering LC margins to facilitate imports.\n\nHowever, these measures have not curbed rising prices. Food inflation remained high at 13.80% in November.\n\nMeanwhile, stock market reforms have begun, unnecessary expenses in development projects are being curtailed, and government operating costs are being reined in.\n\nThese reforms suggest that the economy might improve in the future.\n\nHowever, old challenges like dollar market volatility are likely to persist into the new year, according to economists and analysts.\n\nStakeholders warn that strict import controls could further exacerbate industrial sector crises.\n\nReduced liquidity might push interest rates higher, which would hinder investments and slow job creation.\n\nBangladesh Bank Governor Dr Ahsan H Mansur has warned that non-performing loans could nearly double within six months.\n\nSpeaking at a recent event, he said: “We are examining the financial sector’s health. Non-performing loans could reach 25% to 30% in the near future, up from the current 12.5%. Next month, it could hit 15%, then 17%, and eventually 30%.”\n\nHe emphasized that much of this defaulted debt already exists but will soon be reflected in official figures.\n\nMeanwhile, Economic Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed said: \"The economy is relatively strong now.\"\n\nResponding to questions after a cabinet meeting on January 2, he said: “I won’t say this is true across all sectors. Some discipline has returned to the banking sector, and Bangladesh Bank is trying to support weaker banks.”\n\nFormer World Bank Chief Economist for Dhaka, Dr Zahid Hussain, said that the stagnation in trade and business will take time to resolve.\n\n“Business owners are concerned about the direction of politics in the next one to one-and-a-half years, including which party might assume power,” he said.\n\nAn analysis of central bank data reveals that 2024 was marked by economic distress.\n\nThe crisis began in 2022 with the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, which triggered runaway inflation and declining foreign currency reserves. Net reserves fell below $13 billion (per IMF calculations) in April.\n\nSimultaneously, money laundering increased significantly, exacerbating pressure on the dollar.\n\nThe dollar shortage disrupted essential imports like fertilizers and fuel, leading to overdue payments. International credit rating agencies downgraded Bangladesh’s creditworthiness, exposing vulnerabilities in the economy.\n\nIn August, during and after the fall of the Awami League government, the economy faced significant disruptions.\n\nWithdrawal limits were imposed on bank funds, further slowing economic activities. Commodity prices rose sharply.\n\nAfter the interim government assumed power, the financial sector—particularly banks and the stock market—faced more visible challenges, coupled with unrest in industrial zones.\n\nTogether, these factors slowed trade and commerce.\n\nFollowing the government’s fall, significant labor unrest erupted in major industrial zones around Dhaka, lasting until October.\n\nIn an effort to curb inflation, the government adopted a contractionary monetary policy by raising policy rates after the July-August uprising.\n\nHowever, this has yet to succeed, as inflation continues to rise.\n\nThe apparel sector, plagued by labor unrest and other challenges, faces uncertainty in maintaining export growth.\n\nEntrepreneurs in this sector report a nearly 50% increase in production costs, while foreign buyers have reduced the prices of Bangladeshi apparel.\n\nAccording to BGMEA data, 100 garment factories closed in the past six months, leaving 50,000 to 60,000 workers unemployed.\n\nAt least 158 factories are struggling to pay wages on time.

As a result, buyers’ confidence has somewhat eroded.”\n\nBKMEA President Mohammad Hatem said: “Buyers have reduced prices while bank loan interest rates have risen.

If prices continue to drop, manufacturers will have to bear the full burden, which may lead them to operate at a loss.\n\nThe RMG manufacturers said that the US buyers offer around 5%- 8% lower prices than previously, while the EU buyers offer 6%- 7% lower prices.\n\nAccording to the Office of Textiles and Apparel (Otexa), from January to September 2024, the price of Bangladeshi-made cotton knit sweaters declined by 9.2% in the US market, Bangladesh's single largest export destination compared to the same period last year.\n\nMoreover, the data also showed that the price of M/B cotton woven trousers fell by 8.4%, M/G cotton woven trousers declined by 4.8%, M/B cotton woven shirts declined by 4.7%, and the price of cotton knitted T-shirts plunged by 4.5% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, the price of cotton knit T-shirts declined by 8.36% in kg from January to August 2024 in the EU markets, the largest market for Bangladeshi shippers.\n\nEurostat also stated that the price of M/B cotton woven trousers declined by 7.24%, cotton knit sweaters declined by 6.13%, and W/G cotton woven trousers fell by 6.97% in the same period.\n\nBangladesh fixed the minimum wages of RMG workers last year. The manufacturers also accepted the workers' 18-point demands during the post-uprising unrest in the RMG sector.\n\nMohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and additional managing director of Denim Expert Ltd said that manufacturers are being pushed between a rock and a hard place.\n\n“We don’t receive fair prices; while having to bear all production costs and pay workers' wages.\n\n“This pressure has driven many out of business; some have even left the country. To survive, factories accept orders at meagre margins, often at discounted rates. Most are barely breaking even,” he added.\n\nHe also said that whenever the government fixed a new minimum wage, they were bound to comply with the recommended wages, even if it meant taking loans to pay wages and benefits.\n\n“If price cuts continue, this will severely threaten our survival,” he added.\n\nIndustry insiders said that as the industry expanded, the cost of doing business increased proportionally.\n\nOver the past five years, production costs have surged by a staggering 50%. This increase stems from a combination of factors: rising wages, escalating utility expenses, and a sharp uptick in raw material prices.\n\nBank interest rates have also gone up, while costs like airfreight have increased exorbitantly in recent months, and factories face a constant struggle to balance operational costs without compromising competitiveness.\n\nMohiuddin Rubel, said: “Without a price increase, sustainability practices in factories could be disrupted. We always try to meet the demands of the buyers to maintain competitiveness. However, if the price is being reduced from the buyers’ ends, it will force the manufacturers to operate at a loss,” he added.\n\nBangladesh is the leader in the USGBC Leed green certification with 230 factories. Nine of the top 10 factories are from Bangladesh, and the highest-rated and second-highest-rated factories are also from Bangladesh.\n\nAccording to industry insiders, manufacturers with green factories do not get a higher price for having green factories but a priority in bargaining.\n\nWhen asked if the lower price could affect the green transformation, Mohiuddin Rubel said that fair pricing could speed green transformation up and ultimately help buyers.\n\n“I do not say the reducing price will hamper our green transformation, but fair prices would enable us to provide them with more eco-friendly and sustainably produced products,” he added.\n\nSM Sourcing Ltd is one of the world’s highest-rated green factories. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, Mirza Shams Mahmud, the factory's managing director, said that setting up a green factory is initially costly but cost-effective in the long run.\n\n“Reducing prices demotivates us but we have to go with it to ensure our commitment for the environment and zero-carbon footprint,” he added.\n\nRubel said the government should take the initiative to reduce operating costs, particularly energy.\n\n“We also bear responsibilities ourselves. We must stop accepting orders at unreasonably low prices. We need to end unhealthy competition within the industry—for example, if one factory accepts $1 per unit, another shouldn’t undercut them by offering $0.80,” he added.\n\nHe also said that such practices undermine better negotiation opportunities.\n\n“At the same time, buyers need to change their mindset. We must challenge the assumption that Bangladesh should consistently deliver at lower costs. Buyers often place higher demands on Bangladesh but offer prices 10% lower than in Pakistan, India, or Vietnam. This tendency needs to change. Ultimately, we must ensure fair pricing for the sake of sustainability,” he added.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 836, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:10:44.926581"}

However, these factories were operational for only four days last month due to frequent worker protests.\n\nSeveral world-renowned brands, including H&M, Inditex, Jack & Jones, Next, and Pull & Bear, source apparel from Dekko factories, which have the capacity to produce 2.5 million pieces per month. Despite the recent closures, operations have been running at full capacity since the beginning of this month.\n\nKalpon Hossain, managing director of Dekko Legacy, told the Dhaka Tribune that even after agreeing to all of the workers' demands, production was halted, forcing the factories to close.\n\n“We held seven meetings with the labor representatives. After the seventh meeting, they finally agreed to return to work. Since then, there have been no further issues, and the factory's production activities are running at full capacity,” he added.\n\nHe also emphasized that law enforcement agencies, employers, and labor unions play a key role in restoring order in factories, expressing hope that the current stability will continue.\n\nAshulia-based AR Jeans Producers Ltd. and Lusaka Group factories faced similar issues. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Md. Hafizur Rahman Sarker, chairman of Lusaka Group, noted that his factories were operational for only eight days last month due to the protests.\n\n“Currently, our factories are operational, although efficiency and production capacity have been affected. We had to dismiss several management officials, and now some less skilled staff are handling operations,” he added.\n\nAR Jeans Producers Ltd, a LEED-certified, top-rated green factory, narrowly avoided a serious arson attack, though its entrance gate and generator room were set on fire on September 29. Last month, the factory managed to stay operational for 18 days.\n\nNazmul Kabir, managing director of the factory, told the Dhaka Tribune that while the factory is now operational, tensions remain.\n\n“We agreed to all 18 of the workers' demands, some of which were implicit in nature. We'll have to wait until December to assess the situation fully,” he said.\n\nKabir also praised the visible and strong presence of law enforcement, which has helped manufacturers feel more secure.\n\nKhandoker Rafiqul Islam, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), noted that nearly 100% of the factories in major RMG industrial hubs in Savar, Ashulia, DMP, and Gazipur have been operational in recent days, thanks to the cooperation of all parties for the sake of the country’s economy.\n\nHe expressed hope that this trend would continue, as entrepreneurs have agreed to the workers' 18-point demands and have already begun implementing them.\n\nThe manufacturers said that the combined efforts of factory owners, the government, law enforcement agencies, and trade unions have boosted their confidence in keeping their factories operational.\n\nBGMEA Director Mohiuddin Rubel told Dhaka Tribune that the collective commitment of all stakeholders has been crucial in building trust within the RMG sector.\n\n“As the RMG sector involves everyone, the dedication of each stakeholder helped to restore confidence. The manufacturers sought support, and everyone—government, law enforcement, and trade unions—stepped in to help keep the factories running,” he said.\n\nHe also noted that groups with vested interests and anarchists, who sought to disrupt the sector, have been defeated, as such negative forces cannot prevail indefinitely.\n\n“Over time, workers realized the influence of external agitators and vested interests. They avoided falling into their trap and returned to their workplaces,” Rubel added, emphasizing that manufacturers remain attentive to the legitimate demands of workers, recognizing them as the lifeblood of the RMG sector.\n\nThe manufacturers emphasized the need to maintain stability at all costs, as the RMG sector is the lifeblood of the country’s economy.\n\nMohiuddin Rubel highlighted that ensuring security at industrial hubs must be the top priority.\n\n“The jhut (fabric waste) business is one of the key drivers behind the involvement of outside agitators and vested interest groups. The jhut business and related recycling operations must be kept free from external influences,” he said.\n\nHe also stressed that those responsible for creating unrest in the sector should face strict legal action.\n\nKalpon Hossain noted that manufacturers must proceed with caution to counter the conspiracies of vested interest groups.\n\nNazmul Kabir expressed concern that some buyers are hesitant to source from the Ashulia zone, and steps must be taken to remove this negative perception.\n\n“Additionally, many factories that benefited under the previous regime are located in Ashulia, and this poses a challenge, as these industrialists or their associates might still be active,” he added.\n\nEarlier, on Wednesday, at the inauguration of the TCB Goods program for RMG workers at a factory in Gazipur, Labor and Employment Secretary HM Safikuzzaman emphasized that any unrest or misconduct in the garment factories must be addressed firmly, whether by workers or manufacturers.\n\nHe stated that those who vandalize factories or block roads will not be exempt from punishment, and manufacturers involved in wrongdoing will also face strict actions.\n\nAsif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan, adviser to the Ministry of Labor and Employment, remarked that there had been a simmering discontent for 16 years.\n\n“Outsiders also attempted to exploit this anger. However, we have successfully addressed the workers' 18-point demands. Despite the rampant corruption over the past 16 years, the RMG sector remains the backbone of our economy. We will take all necessary measures to keep the sector stable,” he added.\n\nKalpon Hossain mentioned that buyers consistently trust Bangladesh because it is the second-largest RMG exporter in the world.\n\n\"However, we must proceed cautiously, as any shift in orders could pose a significant risk for us. India and Pakistan remain major competitors, so ensuring security is a critical challenge,\" he added.\n\nMohiuddin Rubel emphasized that maintaining the safe and secure operation of factories is key to reassuring buyers.\n\n\"We need to focus on ensuring this to keep their confidence,\" he said.\n\nOn August 5, after the ousting and subsequent flight of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina due to a mass uprising, a sudden political power vacuum emerged, leading to instability in law and order.\n\nDuring this period, RMG workers voiced several demands and grievances related to their working conditions, including issues like wage nonpayment, irregular increments, nonpayment for earned leave, and discrimination in certain factories, according to industry insiders.\n\nSome factories also experienced local unrest stemming from political reasons, particularly those that had been politically empowered under the previous regime.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, external agitators and a group of local BNP and AL leaders exploited the situation to gain control of the lucrative jhut (fabric waste) business, triggering a power struggle between rival factions.\n\nOn Thursday, nearly 100% of factories in the major RMG industrial hubs of Savar, Ashulia, DMP, and Gazipur were operational.\n\nAccording to sources, four factories were closed that day: two in Savar and Ashulia, and two in the Gazipur area.\n\nIn Savar and Ashulia, 99.50% of the 397 factories remained operational.

But as time passed and technology became so accessible, our way of documenting and archiving our memories has evolved.\n\nIn today's era, sharing everything on social media is the new norm, finding validation through the interactions and responses to our posts. Social media has taken charge of our narratives and has become a showreel of the highlights of our lives.\n\nAccording to Brainstation, Facebook remains the predominant platform for sharing celebratory moments, with 94% of users reporting they have used the site for sharing milestones. Instagram follows at 39%, and Snapchat ranks third with 27%.\n\nFrom pictures of accomplishing the 10k steps challenge to videos from graduating from Oxford, the moment you open social media, you are bombarded with these “achievement” posts.\n\nRecent research indicates that when we compare our life milestones with others on social media, particularly during pivotal moments, it often leads to feelings of inadequacy.\n\nAccording to the Evening Standard, 86% of those surveyed feel that society places excessive pressure on them to achieve these milestones.\n\nIs it truly advisable to share personal milestones on social media? Beneath the fleeting gush of happiness and seemingly flawless moments lies a nuanced balance of upsides and downsides\n\nThe way people perceive it is the key. Be careful of the way you present yourself and your achievements on the platforms. Sharing your achievements can be positive if you aim to inspire others, commemorate your efforts, or make it seem doable and be the beacon of light. Conversely, if your motivation is purely to boast or seek validation, it might be perceived as self-centred or attention-seeking attracting the wrong kind of energy.\n\nThink twice about the audience and try not to inflict any sort of envy on them. While some of your friends may be genuinely ecstatic about your achievements, some may not. The bitter truth is that not everyone will be happy about your success, and your milestones.\n\nSome will question it, some will demean it, and some may even reject it. Be mindful of how your posts may affect different people in your social circle.\n\nNow imagine, how a woman experiencing challenges in conceiving might feel upon seeing a celebratory post about someone else's child being born. The person sharing the post may not even be aware of the excruciating pain they struck the person.\n\nIt's important to be considerate when sharing happy news on social media, ensuring that it doesn't cause anyone pain or affect their sense of self-worth.\n\nIn Islamic teachings, such practices are strictly prohibited owing to the concept of \"nazaar\" which refers to the evil eye or harmful envy that can affect a person due to others' jealousy or admiration. So, it is advisable to not flaunt one’s blessings.\n\nSeeing someone else's success can make people compare themselves to that person. They might start feeling like they're not doing as well or achieving as much, which can make them feel down.\n\nSo, should you stop celebrating your good news then? If you want to celebrate with others, keep it small and invite only close friends or family members who can keep things low-key. Spend some quiet time reflecting on your good news and expressing gratitude in a way that feels meaningful to you.\n\nRemember, your accomplishments hold value beyond likes and comments. They are personal milestones that shape your journey.

Should they be on it at all? If they aren't, will they be social pariahs? Should parents monitor their conversations? Do parental controls work?\n\nNavigating social media as a parent — not to mention a child — is not easy. Using social media platforms is still the default for most American teenagers, with the Pew Research Center reporting that 58% of teens are daily users of TikTok, including 17% who describe their TikTok use as almost constant. About half of teens use Snapchat and Instagram daily, with near-constant use at 14% and 8% for each, respectively.\n\nBut parents — and even some teens themselves — are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Lawmakers have taken notice and have held multiple congressional hearings on child online safety. But even with apparent bipartisan unity, making laws and regulating companies takes time. So far, no regulation has passed.\n\nWhat are parents — and teens — supposed to do in the meantime? Here are some tips on staying safe, communicating and setting limits on social media — for kids as well as their parents.\n\nThere is already, technically, a rule that prohibits kids under 13 from using platforms that advertise to them without parental consent: The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act that went into effect in 2000, before today’s teenagers were even born.\n\nThe goal was to protect kids’ online privacy by requiring websites and online services to disclose clear privacy policies and get parents’ consent before gathering personal information on their kids, among other things. To comply, social media companies have generally banned kids under 13 from signing up for their services.\n\nBut times have changed, and online privacy is no longer the only concern when it comes to kids being online. There’s bullying, harassment, the risk of developing eating disorders, suicidal thoughts or worse.\n\nFor years, there has been a push among parents, educators and tech experts to wait to give children phones — and access to social media — until they are older, such as the “Wait Until 8th” pledge that has parents sign a pledge not to give their kids a smartphone until the 8th grade, or about age 13 or 14. Some wait even later, like 16 or 17.\n\nBut neither social media companies nor the government have done anything concrete to increase the age limit.\n\n“There is not necessarily a magical age,” said Christine Elgersma, a social media expert at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. But, she added, “13 is probably not the best age for kids to get on social media.”\n\nThe laws currently being proposed include blanket bans on the under-13 set when it comes to social media. The problem? There’s no easy way to verify a person’s age when they sign up for apps and online services. And the apps popular with teens today were created for adults first. Companies have added some safeguards over the years, Elgersma noted, but these are piecemeal changes, not fundamental rethinks of the services.\n\n“Developers need to start building apps with kids in mind,” she said.\n\nSome tech executives, celebrities such as Jennifer Garner and parents from all walks of life have resorted to banning their kids from social media altogether. While the decision is a personal one that depends on each child and parent, some experts say this could lead to isolating kids, who could be left out of activities and discussions with friends that take place on social media or chat services.\n\nAnother hurdle — kids who have never been on social media may find themselves ill-equipped to navigate the platforms when they are suddenly allowed free rein the day they turn 18.\n\nA more realistic and effective approach to social media, experts say, is a slow, deliberate onboarding that gives children the tools and information they need to navigate a world in which places like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat are almost impossible to escape.\n\n“You cannot just expect that the kids will jump into the world of social media, learn how to swim on their own,” said Natalie Bazarova, a professor of communications and director of the Cornell Social Media Lab. “They need to have instruction.”\n\nStart early, earlier than you think. Elgersma suggests that parents go through their own social media feeds with their children before they are old enough to be online and have open discussions on what they see. How would your child handle a situation where a friend of a friend asks them to send a photo? Or if they see an article that makes them so angry they just want to share it right away?\n\nFor older kids, Elgersma says to approach them with curiosity and interest, asking about what their friends are doing or just not asking direct questions like, “What are you doing on Instagram?” but rather, “Hey, I heard this influencer is really popular.” And even if your kid rolled their eyes it could be a window.\n\nDon’t say things like “Turn that thing off!” when your kid has been scrolling for a long time, says Jean Rogers, the director of the nonprofit Fairplay’s Screen Time Action Network.\n\n“That’s not respectful,” Rogers said. “It doesn’t respect that they have a whole life and a whole world in that device.”\n\nInstead, Rogers suggests asking them questions about what they do on their phone, and see what your child is willing to share.\n\nKids are also likely to respond to parents and educators “pulling back the curtains” on social media and the sometimes insidious tools companies use to keep people online and engaged, Elgersma said. Watch a documentary like “The Social Dilemma” that explores algorithms, dark patterns and dopamine feedback cycles of social media. Or read up with them how Facebook and TikTok make money.\n\n“Kids love to be in the know about these things, and it will give them a sense of power,” she said.\n\nRogers says most parents have success with taking their kids’ phones overnight to limit their scrolling. Occasionally kids might try to sneak the phone back, but it’s a strategy that tends to work because kids need a break from the screen.\n\n“They need to an excuse with their peers to not be on their phone at night,” Rogers said. “They can blame their parents.”\n\nParents may need their own limits on phone use. Rogers said it’s helpful to explain what you are doing when you do have a phone in hand around your child so they understand you are not aimlessly scrolling through sites like Instagram. Tell your child that you’re checking work email, looking up a recipe for dinner or paying a bill so they understand you’re not on there just for fun. Then tell them when you plan to put the phone down.\n\nSocial media platforms that cater to children have added an ever-growing array of parental controls as they face increasing scrutiny over child safety. For instance, Meta unveiled parental supervision tools last year that lets parents set time limits, see who their kid follows or is followed by, and allows them to track how much time the minor spends on Instagram. It does not let parents see message content.\n\nBut as with similar tools on other platforms such as TikTok, the feature is optional, and both kids and parents have to agree to use it. In order to nudge kids toward agreeing to set up the controls, Instagram sends a notice to teens after they block someone, encouraging them to let their parents “supervise” their account. The idea is to grab kids’ attention when they might be more open to parental guidance.\n\nBy making the feature optional, Meta says it is trying to “balance teen safety and autonomy” as well as prompt conversations between parents and their children.\n\nSuch features can be useful for families in which parents are already involved in their child’s online life and activities. Experts say that’s not the reality for many people.\n\nUS Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last year it’s unfair to expect parents to manage what their children do with rapidly evolving technology that “fundamentally changes how their kids think about themselves, how they build friendships, how they experience the world — and technology, by the way, that prior generations never had to manage.\"\n\nPutting all of that on the shoulders of parents, he said, \"is just simply not fair.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1403, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:11:15.515203"}

While Trump deigned to even be present, at least he did not make it worse. Which, given his track record, is a sign of potential growth. Or maybe that is just the unbridled optimism that I am often accused of.\n\nI saw bits of the inauguration ceremony, and I have to say, America knows how to put on a show. From Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez to the new face of poet Amanda Gorman, I have seen movies less engaging and entertaining than the presidential inauguration.\n\nWhich is why it is almost funny how the most hyped moment of the day, circulating the internet many times over by now, was a photo of a somewhat disgruntled looking Bernie Sanders sitting there. As one internet meme pointed out, he looked like “attend the ceremony celebrating peaceful transition of power in this nation” was just another item on a long todo list the veteran senator had to get through on Wednesday.\n\nSince then, Bernie Sanders has ended up becoming a meme template. Finding Bernie in a mask in the most unexpected places has been a common occurrence this past week. In fact, Sanders himself made the most of it by selling t-shirts with the meme on them for a fundraiser.\n\nI have to admit, some of the memes are funny. Bernie Sanders sitting with the Justice League, or Bernie Sanders in someone’s backyard, is yet to get old, in my humble opinion. Nevertheless, something is bothering me.\n\nFor the last two elections, Bernie Sanders has represented, to many Americans, someone who understands their struggles. Someone who believes that no one should have to choose between keeping their home and getting healthcare. That anyone willing to go to college and work hard should not collapse under a mountain of student loans. For pretty much his entire life, Bernie Sanders has stood for ideals that have made him a very lonely soldier. And yet, Sanders has not compromised. Following last week, in fact, Sanders has made clear that sometimes, his very appearance is a sign that he has not, and will not, compromise.\n\nThe first thing you notice in that photo, is that Bernie is substantially distanced from everyone else around him. Even amidst celebration, he is mindful of social distancing. He is wearing a mask. Not a fancy designer one that probably costs more than one of my shirts. In fact, he is wearing the same blue surgical mask that a store would hand out for free when you do not have one of your own. He looks grumpy, possibly because he is cold. Relentless servant of democracy that he is, Sanders is still unhappy about being outdoors in the January cold. Talk about keeping it real!\n\nThe newspapers that ran stories about the outfit choices of all the guests at the ceremony hit the mother lode of talking points from the Senator’s familiar mittens. The hand-warmers, a gift from a school teacher drew attention to educators around the country who have been scrambling to adapt to the ‘new normal’ of education without anything resembling the necessary infra-structural support, and that they were repurposed from old sweaters and recycled plastic fleece made the kind of ‘style statement’ that is actually relevant in the era of climate change.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that Bernie Sanders, whether he meant to or not, said a lot with his presence. The fact that he showed up means he cares for democracy and the peaceful transition from one president to another, something that many Americans now realize they were taking for granted for too long. The manner in which he showed up, probably shows that for him this is doing his duty, not just celebrating. He has an envelope in his hands, because he still has to get some work done after this. Bernie Sanders is here to cheer on the next president, but he has not forgotten, and is not about to ignore, his own part in the long battle ahead. If only each of us could do as much.\n\nBernie Sanders has lived a lonely life in the arena of US politics, advocating for rights that very few care for to the extent that he does. He has had two unsuccessful bids at running for the highest office of the country that did not meet with much success, because voters on all sides feel that they stand to lose a lot if Sanders gets to do the things he wants to. Wildly popular among younger Americans, it still seems unlikely that he will get to see the issues he advocates for so fiercely resolved in his lifetime. Yet, Bernie Sanders plods on. With his functional outfit, his frown, and the commitment to stand -- or sit -- alone when that is what time demands of him.\n\nIt is just a tad bit unfortunate that all this seems to get lost, when one of the last senators fighting for the little guy, gets reduced to a meme template.\n\nHammad Ali is a PhD student and a lover of fountain pens", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 879, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:11:25.875295"}

Between 2010 and 2022, Bangladesh’s average FDI inflows stood to be 0.9% of GDP, said the former central bank governor.\n\nAt the same time, India and Vietnam's figures were 1.7% and 4.6% respectively.\n\nBangladesh required more FDIs to stabilize foreign exchange rate right now which would help to decline inflation in the country, he stated in his keynote.\n\n“We must strengthen financial sector governance and bolster overall business confidence. FDI inflows need to be bolstered to realize Bangladesh’s macroeconomic potentials, particularly to stabilize its financial balance.”\n\nHe also said that the current tax system tends to favor specific sectors, which prevents fairness and efficiency.\n\n“The country faces lack of digitalization and modernization in tax process, retrospective application of policies and unpredictability, different ID number for same business, lengthy process of incentives, limited number of transfer pricing experts, absence of double tax avoidance agreement, reliance on paper-based return and in-person appeal filling processes add to complexities,” they keynote paper stated.\n\nHigher FDIs would result in a stable foreign exchange rate, which in turn would help lower inflation, Atiur also said.\n\nThe paper also said that 33% tax reduction and effective tax reforms would increase both FDI and tax revenue significantly.\n\nIn this model, FDI could increase from $3.14 billion in 2022 to $51.4 billion in 2041 and tax revenue could increase from $34.44 billion in 2022 to $227.21 billion in 2041.\n\nThere is no alternative to bolstering FDI inflow.

{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/longform/342869/are-laws-related-to-sexual-harassment-sufficient", "title": "Are laws related to sexual harassment sufficient to protect survivors?", "body": "The tragic demise of Fairuz Sadaf Abantika, a student from Jagannath University (JnU), who committed suicide after facing repeated bullying and harassment, is a wakeup call for all. Fairuz was brave enough to report her experience to the committee in her university, but after negligence from the authorities, she eventually succumbed to continuous bullying and harassment from her peers. Why are anti-harassment committees not functional in universities? Why do authorities not take such complaints related to sexual harassment and bullying seriously?\n\nHigh court guidelines\n\nIn 2022, the High Court (HC) of Bangladesh asked the government to submit a report providing the names of the institutions that had formed a committee against sexual harassment at the educational institutions and workplaces complying with a court order. Despite seeking explanation regarding the absence of functionality of such anti-harassment committees as a follow up of its groundbreaking 2009 guideline, little to no progress has been made. In addition, gaps in the existing laws are often causing survivors to be re-victimized and subject to further harassment, which was also the case for the deceased Fairuz.\n\nIn the HC directive issued in 2009, guidelines were given for all workplaces and educational institutions aimed at filling in the legislative vacuum and to create awareness on the different forms of sexual harassment and the consequences of sexual offenses. However, in case of the complaints process, much of the directives are overlooked and often not prioritized. The directive mentions that the identity of the complainant and also of the accused will not be disclosed until the allegation is proved, but in most cases the confidentiality is not maintained, which was also the case for the JnU student Fairuz. Under the directive, safety and security of the complainant must be ensured by the concerned authority, but in Fairuz’s case, she was brutally harassed, teased and bullied by her peers after she reported her complaint and the authorities did not bat an eye to ensure her safety in the university premises.\n\nA five member committee has been referred to in the HC Directive which has been adopted in the Labour Rules in September 2022, removing the inclusion of external members in the committee. However, the only reference to labour law on this matter can be found in Section 332 as the Labour Rules added rule 361A without reference to any law. The only section of law found closest to the rule was Section 332 of the labour law on conduct towards female employees. Other than a short definition, no other mention is found on harassment:\n\n“Section 332 -- Conduct towards female employees: Where any female is employed in any work of the establishment, irrespective of her rank or status, no one of that establishment shall behave with the female employee which may seem to be indecent or repugnant to the modesty or honor of the female employee.”\n\nSexual harassment can happen to anyone irrespective of gender. This section which is being speculated as the relevant section of labour law to refer to is an anomaly. The section does not specify a disciplinary process and the Labour Rules came in before the labour law was amended. Rules are made by the executive on the basis of laws passed by the parliament. In this case, the wheel has come before the cart.\n\nThe Labour Rule now removes externals from the complaints committee. However, the HC directed externals in the committee for ensuring transparency and credibility. Since the rules came before the labour law, many private sector organizations are treating harassment cases as misconduct, although there is no particular definition of harassment under misconduct. As the law continues to be vague, the vacuum still exists and the HC guidelines should be adhered to till such legislation is in place. A complaint process should be clearly defined in the labour law or Labour Rules. Since labour laws are not applicable for all places, institutions may adopt similar provisions in their own disciplinary rules.\n\nA good anti-harassment committee guided by HC and international best practises should consist of:\n\nAll people associated with the university to be sensitized to forms of harassment and abuse. Mass sensitization on what constitutes harassment and what can and cannot be done.\n\nProper channels to report complaints. A hotline/helpline number, mail account with proper communication on how to report.\n\nOnce a complaint is reported, the step of a swift and just response is key. The following is a recommended approach:\n\nFinally, whatever is learned from individual cases and risk assessments should provide the basis of improving policies and processes.\n\nOther than sexual harassment, recurring ragging in the campuses is another burning issue that is hampering the mental health and overall wellbeing of the students. Over the years, ragging has become part of the culture, not only in universities but also in other educational institutions. In 2020, the HC also directed for anti-ragging committees in all educational institutions, but are they actually functioning? The process to be followed when sexual harassment or bullying complaint is lodged; complaints are to be assessed upon receiving and filtered based on severity, minor grievances to be mediated by Persons of Trust in universities and serious offenses to go for investigation. The irony is that in case of Fairuz, the complaint was never even forwarded to the VC of JnU for further action, which led to compromised safety of the student and eventually compelled her to commit suicide, out of fear and frustration.\n\nAlong with reforms made in the laws, mass sensitization is required to break patriarchal mindsets and ensure empathy towards survivors. Fairuz was subject to victim blaming and unfortunately, along with students, some of the teachers were also perpetuating this abuse towards her. The deafening silence from the authorities in case of Fairuz speaks volumes about the lack of functionality of such anti-harassment committees and it is high time civil society, legal practitioners and duty bearers became more vocal about such issues and actively advocated for amendments in the laws under sexual harassment.\n\nJenefa Jabbar is a Barrister and the Director of Social Compliance and Safeguarding at BRAC.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1012, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:12:33.735749"}

Suicide rates are determined by the number of individuals who take their own lives per 100,000 people.\n\nSouth Korea has the highest suicide rate among the OECD countries, 13,195 people died by suicide in 2020. Generally, men commit more suicide than women. In South Korea the ratio in 2020 was men: 35.5 per 100,000, and women: 15.9 per 100,000.\n\nEmile Durkheim provided a sociological theory of suicide in 1897. He argued that suicide rates could be explained by social factors rather than individual psychological factors alone.\n\nDurkheim argued that individuals with weak social ties are more likely to commit suicide. Individuals to strengthen their social bonds require a sense of belonging.\n\nHe identified three main types of suicide: Egoistic, altruistic, and anomic. Egoistic suicide occurs when individuals feel disconnected from society due to weak social ties. Altruistic suicide happens when individuals are overly integrated into society, sacrificing themselves for the collective good. Anomic suicide occurs during periods of social disruption or normlessness, such as economic crises.\n\nDurkheim emphasized the importance of social integration, regulation, and cultural norms in understanding and preventing suicide, arguing that strong social bonds and clear societal norms can act as protective factors against suicidal behaviour.\n\nIt is important to emphasize social support in preventing suicide. This could involve organizing community events, offering support groups for individuals experiencing difficulties, and encouraging open communication about mental health issues.\n\nSocial integration or its lack and mental illness are all interrelated.\n\nSuicide is influenced by various social, psychological, and individual factors. Some common social factors include:\n\n1. Social isolation: Feelings of loneliness or being disconnected from others can increase the risk of suicide.\n\n2. Relationship problems: Conflict, abuse, or loss of relationships (such as through divorce or bereavement) can contribute to suicidal thoughts.\n\n3. Stigma and discrimination: Facing discrimination based on factors like sexual orientation, gender identity, race, or socioeconomic status can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness.\n\n4. Media reporting: Sensationalized or irresponsible media reporting of suicide can contribute to \"contagion\" or copycat suicides.\n\nPsychological factors also play a significant role, including:\n\n1. Mental illness: Conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance abuse disorders are major risk factors for suicide.\n\n2. Hopelessness: Feeling trapped in difficult circumstances without seeing a way out can lead to a sense of hopelessness.\n\n3. Impulsivity: Some suicides occur impulsively, without much planning, especially among individuals with mood disorders.\n\n4. Low self-esteem: Negative self-perceptions and feelings of worthlessness can contribute to suicidal thoughts.\n\n5. Trauma: Experiencing trauma, abuse, or adverse childhood experiences can increase vulnerability to suicide.\n\nIt is important to note that suicide is a multifaceted issue, and individuals may have unique combinations of risk factors. Prevention efforts often focus on addressing these factors through community support, mental health education, access to mental health services, and reducing stigma surrounding mental illness and help-seeking behaviours.\n\nSeveral countries including South Korea have implemented effective suicide prevention strategies. South Korea has made significant strides in addressing its high suicide rate through comprehensive public health and community initiatives.\n\nOne key aspect of South Korea's approach is the establishment of the \"Suicide Prevention Centre\" within the Korea Suicide Prevention Center (KSPC), which coordinates nationwide suicide prevention efforts.\n\nThe centre provides crisis intervention services, suicide hotlines, counselling, and education programs. Additionally, South Korea has implemented community-based interventions, including gatekeeper training programs to educate teachers, healthcare professionals, and community leaders to recognize signs of suicide risk and intervene effectively.\n\nMoreover, South Korea has focused on reducing access to lethal means, such as pesticides and charcoal, which were commonly used methods of suicide in the past. This has involved legislative measures, public awareness campaigns, and collaboration with industry stakeholders.\n\nWhile South Korea still faces challenges in addressing mental health stigma and providing adequate mental health services, its concerted efforts in suicide prevention have resulted in a decline in the country's suicide rate in recent years, demonstrating the effectiveness of comprehensive and coordinated strategies.\n\nAs a student many years ago, transitioning from Bagerhat, a small town, to Dhaka University, and later briefly serving as a lecturer, I vividly recall the challenges of social and emotional adjustment.\n\nDuring my student days, I distinctly remember storming out of a class one day. Later, I had a heart-to-heart conversation with one of my teachers, Anwarullah Chowdhury, who provided comfort and showed empathy. That was all I needed.\n\nI wish teachers were more concerned and provided pastoral care to students as and when they needed it.\n\nBut students deserve better today. They need professional care. Every educational institution needs to deploy the services of counsellors for students and faculty who need such services.\n\nHad there been such institutional support and care, perhaps, we would not lose Sadi Mohammed and Fairuz Abantkia prematurely.

The reason behind putting a focus on harassment, particularly in law schools, is that law students are the future justice providers who are supposed to ensure and establish justice for mass populations. How can a law student who has previously committed sexual assault on a classmate or junior ensure justice for victims of rape or assault or harassment?\n\nA sexist mentality among law students is threatening to take over the legal profession, putting our judiciary in danger. In Bangladesh, men dominate in the legal profession. Sexual harassment of female lawyers and those aspiring to enter the legal field is a common occurrence in a variety of contexts. The court premises have lamentably turned into a space where male lawyers subject female lawyers to scrutiny, focusing on their appearance, demeanour, and personal relationships.\n\nThe rights outlined in Parts II and III of the Bangladeshi Constitution are adequate to promote gender equality and prevent sexual harassment at the workplace. Women's involvement, legal protection, equal employment opportunities, and particular steps for their advancement are highlighted in Articles 10, 26, 29, and 28. The right to life, liberty, and due process are further protected under Articles 31 and 32.\n\nNevertheless, Sections 10 of the Women and Children Repression Act of 2000 and Sections 354 and 509 of the Penal Code of 1860 are the primary legal mechanisms that address sexual harassment in the contemporary legal system. Unfortunately, the significance of institutions in combating sexual harassment in the workplace and in educational settings is not sufficiently emphasised by these laws.\n\nThere is still no definitive law against sexual harassment at work in Bangladesh. Whereas, India, which shares Bangladesh's socioeconomic circumstances, passed the groundbreaking Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act in 2013.\n\nIt is a recognized legal principle to incorporate international standards into fundamental rights in situations where there is no existing domestic law on the subject and no conflict with international treaties and norms. The court held in HM Ershad v Bangladesh, 2001 BLD (AD) 69, that national courts ought to take a nation's international obligations into consideration. The principles established in international accords should be applied by national courts when domestic laws are unclear or do not offer guidance.\n\nThe ILO's Workplace Code of Conduct places a significant focus on preventing sexual harassment. In contrast, the Bangladesh Bar Council's Canons of Professional Conduct and Etiquette do not address the matter of sexual harassment. Bangladesh has not ratified ILO Convention 190, which requires members to report their efforts in the fight against harassment and violence in order to ensure accountability and transparency.\n\nIn the landmark case of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) vs government of Bangladesh and others, the High Court Division of Bangladesh defined sexual harassment and gave recommendations to safeguard women and girls in diverse situations, with a focus on workplace-related harassment. As there is no employer-employee connection with judges, the definition of terminology used in the workplace should be expanded to accommodate the special dynamics that challenge female lawyers in courtrooms.\n\nThe recommendations are devoid of important information about how to file complaints and make investigations. Consequently, students and female lawyers hesitate to report incidents due to the absence of well-defined complaint procedures. Their concerns revolve around the fear of facing retaliation if they criticize their professors, senior lawyers, or judges in law school or the court.\n\nThe Bangladesh Supreme Court established a commission to handle allegations of sexual harassment on its premises. The effectiveness of such committees relies on conducting proactive and impartial investigations into allegations and holding wrongdoers accountable, even if they are judges or senior lawyers.\n\nFurthermore, the Judicial Administration Training Institute (JATI) should provide newly appointed judges with extensive training on gender-sensitive issues. It is crucial that law schools and bar associations work together to develop curricula on professional behaviour standards.\n\nIn Bangladesh, academicians frequently steer clear of addressing rape and sexual harassment in law schools, leaving students to study these topics on their own. This may make it more difficult for students to comprehend the need for legislative reforms and perpetuate the stigma associated with these important conversations.\n\nBangladesh ought to ratify C190 right away since it has strong measures to stop gender-based violence in both the formal and unofficial spheres. To effectively prevent sexual harassment, comprehensive workplace sexual harassment regulations must be passed, legal education must be revamped, and full CEDAW implementation must be ensured.\n\nFatima Zahra Ahasan Raisa is a Human Rights Activist, Bangladesh Human Rights Foundation (BHRF) and a student of law.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 769, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:12:39.039617"}

To cite Equality Now, sexual violence according to Bangladeshi law essentially looks like this:\n\nA lot of depressing stuff to unpack here (we’re still using that phrase, right?).\n\nA direct result of our country’s colonial hangover, the “unnatural offenses” provision (under the infamous Section 377) shows how damaging the impact of dismissing the rights of sexual minorities can be on us heteros. But given that Bangladesh officially recognizes hijras as being “the third gender,” exactly what kind of sex do our law-makers think they’re having?\n\nGetting back to the protests, debates over what clothing is and isn’t “proper as per the country’s culture” will never bear fruit as cultures invariably begin at home: For every 50 slack-jawed fundamentalists taught that a woman should never bare her knees, there will be at least one city girl who gets to pick what to wear when venturing outside her home.\n\nWhat clearly needs to be fixed are the numerous holes in our laws that facilitate retrograde attitudes towards women. I realize that Bangladesh isn’t exactly a beacon of gender equality (the kind that can’t be used as marketing fodder for our ever-rising GDP) but for sexism and misogyny to malignantly spread throughout our judiciary is not a prospect we should be comfortable with.\n\nBut when even children aren’t free from the clutches of our shoddy law-making, what hope does a grown woman have?\n\nRubaiyat Kabir is Joint Editor, Editorial and Op-Ed, Dhaka Tribune.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 434, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:12:41.780539"}

I find this most common attire for Bangali women to be culturally appropriate and modest. But when I walk outside or pass through a busy area, I still make a mental checklist:\n\nEven in my late 30s, while walking on a busy street or through a market, I cover my chest with whatever I’m holding -- a bag, a folder -- so I am not groped. So many preparations and precautions, just to avoid a vulgar stare, a sly whistle, a passing sexual comment, or a physical touch.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not alone.\n\nAll women take these precautions, no matter what they are wearing. Every day, women and girls across the world cycle through mental checklists to protect themselves from sexual harassment, assault, and rape. Regardless of our age, where we live, educational attainment, or social class, sexual harassment of women is common.\n\nAnd for young girls, it is too common, and potentially dangerous.\n\nAccording to the Bangladesh Adolescent Health and Wellbeing Survey 2019–20, one in three unmarried adolescent girls ages 15–19 experienced some form of sexual harassment in the past year. This includes someone staring at them in a vulgar way, singing suggestive songs, sharing sexual comments/jokes, or being touched, grabbed, or pinched.\n\nGirls are harassed regardless of their educational attainment or socio-economic status. The top five places where harassment occurs are in the streets (74%), at home (12%), at educational institutions like schools, colleges, ormadrasas(11%), in neighbourhoods (12%) and in marketplaces (8%).\n\nGirls are, essentially, not safe anywhere.\n\nHow do we keep our girls safe? One popular view is to “get them married.” But the same survey found that one in six ever-married girls experienced sexual harassment in the past year. Not only is nowhere safe, but we are blamed for the violence -- criminal offenses like sexual assault, rape, and murder after assault/rape are often attributed to how the victim was dressed. And due to their wide prevalence, “smaller” offenses like harassment are normalized and rarely discussed.\n\nUnderstanding the gravity of the situation, the government of Bangladesh, along with national and international development partners, are addressing this issue. The National Action Plan on Violence Against Women is one such key initiative, led by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs. Another policy response is the National Strategy for Adolescent Health 2017–20, which puts prevention of harassment and violence against adolescents as a focus area.\n\nIn addition, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Bangladesh, provides primary policy direction. Article 19 of the Convention discusses laws to protect children against all forms of physical and psychological abuse and violence, along with other articles aimed at outlining what is needed for countries to adopt a universal approach towards overall well-being and development.\n\nHowever, while all these initiatives and ratifications look impressive on paper, we still have a long way to go. So, what can be done?\n\nAlongside policy and governmental change, education needs to begin in the home. Although every household is different, many do not provide spaces for open dialogue and discussion among family members. It’s time we create pathways for parents/caretakers to talk to their daughters and sons about safe sex and what happens to bodies during adolescence.\n\nThis could begin with resources from the government or an NGO with helpful information to guide the parents. Outside the family, we should create safe spaces at the community level for girls to share their thoughts and experiences. This can be school based where a teacher can act as amoner bondhuor “agony aunt” without being judgmental.\n\nThe most critical intervention for many developing countries would be to begin early and educate young boys about appropriate behaviour. Boys may sexually harass to prove their masculinity and fit in culturally. But they can learn a different route. We need to remember that no boy is born a sexual predator, and we need to support their roles in promoting mutual respect and egalitarianism.\n\nOnly then can we live in a world where girls and women don’t have to make “safety lists” every morning.\n\nShusmita Khan is Research Associate | Data for Impact (D4I), Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  This article was produced with the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the terms of the Data for Impact (D4I) associate award 7200AA18LA00008, which is implemented by the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in partnership with Palladium International, LLC; ICF Macro, Inc.; John Snow, Inc.; and Tulane University.

But recent findings from an American research institute have found that over a quarter of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, and of those women, 46% say that harassment caused them to leave jobs or switch careers.\n\nWomen who experience sexual harassment at work often go through extended periods of low work productivity, and have lower job satisfaction, according to a 2021 study by Women's Rights GroupAssociation of Women for Action and Research(Aware). Are these women given the conducive environment for them to thrive? We are empowering women, but are we creating a safe workplace for them?\n\nGlobally, two out of every five women face some sort of harassment at their workplace. Recent reports suggest that more than one in three countries do not have any laws against harassment in the workplace. A national survey byBusiness and Human Rights Resource Centerconducted last year found that a majority of women employed in the formal sector have been subjected to some form of sexual harassment at the workplace during the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, with the advent of the internet and widespread use of social media, women are now facing cyber sexual harassment both at home and their workplaces.\n\nThe latest survey by ICT division found that 64% of women in the cities of Bangladesh have faced some sort of cyber sexual harassment. With the increase in sexual harassment towards women both in person and in the cyberspace, can women really feel empowered? If women are not provided with a conducive and gender-friendly work environment, can they really perform well and feel safe at their organization?\n\nThe primary reason behind this grave problem is the deep-rooted patriarchy that exists in the mindset of the people in our society. Embedded patriarchy and toxic masculinity result in women being subject to violence or sexual harassment at their workplace. In spite of women continuously striving to prove their potential, there are still people, both men and women, who think women are not capable of taking up leadership roles, or in fact, working outside their homes.\n\nThis prejudiced and primitive notion is hindering the progress of women, as society forces them to believe that they are incapable of working side by side with men. As a result, many women are still facing some sort of harassment or violence at their workplace. This traumatic experience of abuse or harassment leaves a negative impact on the mental health of such working women, and it is often seen that they face difficulty in performing and thriving at their workplace.\n\nWhen activist Tarana Burke started the globally hit “Me Too” campaign, it emphasized on raising awareness of the prevalence and the pernicious impact of sexual violence. The campaign’s main objective was to spread awareness among survivors of violence, and encourage them to speak out and report their cases of harassment.\n\nWomen in our country also need to break the stigma of concealing their experiences of abuse and sexual harassment, as the longer they keep quiet and hide their cases of violence, the longer the perpetrators will prevail in the society.\n\nThe High Court of Bangladesh has recently asked the government to submit the list of institutions that had formed a complaint committee against sexual harassment at the workplaces complying with a court order issued in 2009. The court also sought explanations from the respective ministries on the failure to implement the 2009 verdict.\n\nIt is important for organizations to comply with the High Court order by introducing proper policies and procedures to address such sort of sexual harassment at the workplace, and building a strong mechanism for complaints and grievance handling.\n\nThis will ensure that women feel safe and are not afraid of speaking up against such experiences at their workplaces. Investment in preventing and addressing sexual harassment always adds value to an organization in terms of increased commitment, better productivity, better organizational reputation, meeting legal obligations, and most importantly, a safe working environment for the staff.\n\nEntities like BRAC have always been vocal about preventing and responding to sexual harassment within the organization and for the communities that it works for. Brac Social Compliance program focuses on promoting a safe workplace and provides technical assistance in corporate and other sectors to establish policies and procedures within their framework.\n\nA safe workplace is every woman's right. Creating a safe workplace free of all forms of sexual harassment is the agenda of today and tomorrow, with evermore women joining workplaces and social spaces outside home. A world with this agenda fulfilled will be a far more humane and productive world.\n\nBarrister Jenefa Jabbar is the Director of BRAC Social Compliance and Safeguarding program.

It gives renewed hope to our export items. We definitely hope to sign an FTA with the EU to expand our market,” the Chief Adviser said.\n\nEuroCham Chairperson Nuria Lopez said Bangladesh needs to begin FTA negotiations urgently, as the country may lose its existing trade preferences in the EU—its largest export destination—after graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) status.\n\nShe noted that an FTA would attract more European investment to Bangladesh, create jobs, and boost exports to advanced Western markets.\n\nLopez pointed out that India is signing an FTA with the EU, while Vietnam already has such an agreement, allowing both middle-income countries preferential access to the European market.\n\n“We are advocating for an FTA. I will go to Europe to encourage private companies to invest in Bangladesh,” she said.\n\nEU Ambassador Michael Miller said that the commercial relationship with Bangladesh will evolve after graduation but not before 2029.\n\nHe underlined the EU’s strong interest to bring European investment and technology to the country - an important market with a population of nearly 200 million - and spoke about the EU readiness to organise an EU-Bangladesh Business Forum in 2026.\n\n“We are looking for early political signals that EU companies will be encouraged to come and will enjoy a level playing field,” he said.\n\nThe Chief Adviser also emphasised the relocation of factories to Bangladesh, noting that European firms can take advantage of the country’s large pool of skilled labour at competitive costs.\n\n“We are building a free trade zone.

I have been doing business for the last 18 years and if anyone asks me to leave the business, he or she has to take the responsibility of my family members,” Raihan Ali, a hawker in the Mirpur area, told Dhaka Tribune.\n\nAnother individual, a wholesale grocery shop owner in Banani said: “Shop owners and small traders are now hard-pressed as their sales are nearly 30% down in recent months. Poverty and unemployment also have consequences on health, not only cigarettes.”\n\nAccording to the President of the Bangladesh Shop Owners Association Md Helal Uddin, licenses should be required only for manufacturers. He further said that they would take to the streets if the livelihoods of more than three million shop owners and small traders are upended in the name of licensing and banning cigarette sales.\n\n“Why  should small traders need licenses from the local government for selling cigarettes?” the association’s leader said.\n\n“I have already held talks with the officials of the Local Government Ministry to scrap licensing requirements for traders under the proposed act,” Helal informed.\n\nBusiness leaders, as well as economists, both agree that the Ministry of Health and Family Planning’s move for making licensing mandatory citing health issues will also deprive the government of thousands of crores of tax earnings at a time when it is needed the most.\n\nThe National Board of Revenue (NBR), in the last 2021-2022 fiscal year, earned nearly Tk30,000 crore from cigarettes in value-added tax (VAT), or approximately 10% of the total revenue income of the country.\n\n“Tobacco sector is the largest contributor to VAT income. Any abrupt decision without the consultation of the revenue board would surely backfire, and nosedive revenue income,” an NBR official said, seeking anonymity.\n\nHe also said that he was dumbstruck and unsure if the relevant government wings and officials failed to comprehend the adverse impacts of the move or not.\n\nAcknowledging the health hazards of smoking, experts also opined that the timing and strategy of the Health Ministry are unrealistic as the government will end up putting already hard-pressed people out of their business and lose huge internal tax revenue.\n\nExperts also said smoking habits can be reduced through increased awareness programmes without sacrificing revenue, and the livelihoods of small traders.\n\nEconomist Dr Ahsan H Mansur said the move will not only lower consumption, but will affect the revenue earning of the country, and will boost the illegal trade of fake tobacco products.\n\nMany clauses of the proposed act are not only impractical, but also harmful to the economy, he added.\n\nMansur, who is also the Executive Director of the Policy Research Institute said that the timing is wrong for a resource-constrained Bangladesh as the government already shelved many development projects, and sought loan packages from the IMF to shore up the economy.\n\nThe government should concentrate on creating awareness against tobacco consumption, rather than harming a legally-run industry, he added.\n\nAccording to World Bank and WHO Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) data, the number of tobacco users in 2009 was 44% of the total population.\n\nThrough the amendment of the Tobacco Control Act and rules in 2013 and 2016 respectively, the government has successfully brought this number down to 34% in 2017.\n\nThis is a leap of 10% in 8 years. At this rate, the smoking rate in Bangladesh can gradually come down to 24% by 2025 and it can go below 5% over the next 15-20 years.\n\nHe felt that the proposal to bring the street vendors under registration will reduce the sale of the top brands but will promote the sale of low-cost brands.\n\n“Since these vendors will not get the supply of top brands produced by the multinational tobacco companies, they will sell low-quality brands of the local companies that are least interested in complying with rules and regulations,” Mansur opined.\n\nAsked why multinational corporations will not sell their products through vendors, Dr Mansoor said: “The reason is very simple- due to their corporate policies, the multinational corporations will never be non-compliant”.\n\nOn June 16, a draft of the amended version of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Control Act 2005 (amended in 2013) was published on the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for public opinion.\n\nTerming the proposed act illogical under the present context, experts and industry insiders have been pondering why the government should pass a law that would surely hit its top revenue-earning source at a time when economic recession looms large across the world.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 964, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:13:59.328415"}

In a time when things are looking slightly better, if the proposed draft for amendment of the law is implemented, the lives of low-income traders and their families will fall into dire crisis.\n\nThe Ministry of Health has prepared a proposal to amend the Smoking and Use of Tobacco Products (Control) Act 2005 (amended in 2013).\n\nRecently, the draft was also put up on the ministry’s website for public opinion. However, the issue of drafting laws without consultation with the stakeholders has already created controversy.\n\nNASCIB leaders demand that the impractical provisions of the draft be withdrawn and the Smoking and Tobacco Products Control Act be amended to be realistic, modern and in favour of the life and livelihood of the small and marginal retail traders.\n\nPresident of NASCIB and Chairman of Informal Sector Industry Skills Council (ISISC) Mirza Nurul Goni Shovon read out a written statement at the event. FBCCI Adviser Manjur Ahmed was also present at the event.\n\nShovon said: \"We welcome the government’s intention to reduce the use of tobacco in the country but the proposed restrictions on selling tobacco products are illogical and will severely impact the livelihoods of over 70 lakh people.”\n\nThe NASCIB president highlighted some of the proposals in the draft amendment and termed them as unrealistic including banning the sale of tobacco and tobacco products without obtaining a mandatory retail license and a Tk50,000 fine for the violation, banning the sale of tobacco and tobacco products in mobile shops or hawkers and Tk5,000 or more as fine for the violation, prohibition of sale, including tea stalls and other shops as a public place where smoking is prohibited, abolition of the designated smoking zone and so on.\n\nAccording to Shovon: “Bangladesh has about 15 lakh remote and marginal low-income retailers, most of whom are known as temporary or floating shopkeepers in remote areas without any permanent address. With such insignificant capital, it is not possible for them to obtain a separate license for the sale of cigarettes or tobacco products, nor is it financially feasible to pay a fine of Tk50,000 or 6 months jail time for the violation. These small businesses and marginal retailers don’t even make Tk500 profit every day and imprisoning them for selling a legal product is simply illogical.”\n\nHe also observed that those who sell bidis or cigarettes as ancillary products along with other materials in remote areas do not have more than Tk500/1000 per day as capital.\n\n“It is not possible for them to pay a fine of Tk5,000 and if they cannot work, their families will suffer in a time when the prices of essential commodities are soaring in the country,” he added.\n\n“Bangladesh is a market where most smokers across the country purchase one or two cigarettes. They cannot afford to buy whole packets. Also, many buy the product in small numbers to slowly quit smoking. If the retail sale of cigarettes is banned, the government will lose a huge amount of revenue from the sector. There is no such provision in tobacco control laws anywhere in this subcontinent including India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Considering the current state of our economy and the interests of buyers and sellers at the marginal level, the decision to stop the retail sale of tobacco products is unreasonable,” the NASCIB president said.\n\n“We are not against reducing tobacco use but we also have to think about the informal economy’s sustainability, especially in the post-Covid scenario.

The new amendments propose a number of drastic measures, which speakers said were unimplementable and counterproductive.\n\nThese include eliminating smoking zones, banning corporate social responsibility activity by tobacco companies, banning the e-cigarette, separating license requirements for selling tobacco products, banning sales of tobacco products by mobile vendors, and banning loose cigarettes.\n\nStakeholders believe these changes in the law can’t be practically implemented and will severely impact stakeholders.\n\nDr M Harunur Rashid, former professor of Dhaka University, and Barrister Shahedul Alam, chief corporate and regulatory officer of Robi Axiata, presented the keynote paper at the dialogue.\n\nThey said that approximately 7 million people involved in the tobacco sector, which includes a large number of low and middle-income businessmen, will be negatively impacted if the new changes are incorporated.\n\nIt will also increase the injection of illicit tobacco products and cause livelihood harm for small businessmen, hawkers and tea stall owners if the draft is passed.\n\nIt will also threaten foreign investment and revenue generation, ultimately harming the country’s economy, which is particularly concerning given the current global economic environment, the speakers said.\n\nMoreover, CSR is an ethical structure for the corporate sector. Any company that makes a profit has a responsibility toward society.\n\nThe new amendment to ban CSR programmes of the tobacco company will put an impact on the achievement of the SDGs, they said.\n\nThe banning on the sale of loose cigarettes will rather increase the health risk as consumers will end up consuming more than their regular cigarette consumption, they added.\n\nThe keynote presenters also said, since tobacco is not an illegal product, the government should regulate it.\n\nThey also said that law enforcement must be coordinated with economic activity. It should be ensured that the tax earned from the industrial sector is spent on the development of the country.\n\nLack of clarity in the new proposed amendments will result in abuse of the law.

One woman, Simona Monti, is seven months pregnant. Three are seated outside on the wrap-around patio. On the patio, Sri Lankan national Harikesha Wijesekara and friend Ishrat Akhond have been talking over coffee since afternoon. They are later joined by Harikesha's wife Pepetha Shayama for dinner. At another patio table, Indian national Sat Prakash sits alone for a quiet dinner. The remaining six Italians are seated at Table 9 in the private dining hall where they have a prior reservation.\n\n[Approximately 8:40pm]\n\nFive men enter the O Kitchen/ Holey Artisan Bakery premises. They shut the gates, open fire and storm the restaurant wielding a machete and shouting “Allahu Akbar.” The militants are later identified as--Nibras Islam, Rohan Imtiaz, Meer Sameeh Mubashir, Shafiul Islam Ujjal and Khairul Islam Payel. The first casualty is pizza chef Saiful Chowkidar who was talking on his cell phone near the pizza oven across the garden. Eyewitnesses see him fall to the ground amid the sound of gunshots. His bullet-hit body is found on the lawn the next day. Mayhem breaks out on the patio. Ishrat, with her back to the lawn and entrance, is fatally injured in the head from behind. Most of the Italians are killed. The autopsy report finds that they were shot and slashed by their attackers. Italian national Gianni Boscheni manages to escape. From inside Japanese national Tamaoki Watanabe runs for cover. He is hit by a bullet and falls to the ground, and is then slashed by the attackers while prone on the ground. He manages to sprint towards the disused pizza oven at the edge of the lawn. The Wijesekaras and Sat Prakash follow his lead to the old oven.

They stand next to Table 7 at which Hasnat Karim and his family are sitting. The sound of gunfire fills the air. The machete flashes in the commotion.

During the night, they manage to stay in touch with the restaurant owner by phone and with another Argentine chef, Gaston Palacios, via Facetime.

Other phones ring but calls are not allowed to be taken. At least one hostage later learns that his family's phone calls, while not answered, were responded to via text messages written by the attackers, telling the family not to worry.

Another replies: “Twenty plus.” During the late hours of the night, the WiFi connection was used to upload photographs of the victims of the attack. The attackers then ask to be shown all escape routes. These are sealed off and locked. The attackers make no visible attempt to escape. They spend the night repeatedly going up and down the stairs.

One waiter is sent upstairs with coffee to where Nibras is using a mobile telephone surrounded by four grenades. Downstairs, the attackers who address each other using their IS noms de guerre discuss their mission and goals. They say their “rules” do not allow the killing of locals. They ask the hostages: “Have you heard of IS? We belong to them. We have come to kill foreigners because they are taking Islam in the wrong direction.” Rohan adds: “All Muslims are brothers. When Muslims are killed in Europe or America, does it not grieve you? “They have killed our innocents. Now we will kill them.” Nibras is the most talkative about Islam and speaks about religion throughout the night with the staff and guests seated at Table 7.\n\nFamily member of the pizza chef Saiful Chowkidar shows his photoRajib Dhar/Dhaka Tribune\n\n[Approximately 2:00 - 3:45am]\n\nHasnat Karim is told to lock the collapsible gate facing the clinic.

The attackers do not eat. At dawn, they say their prayers. One staff member upstairs is forced to sit on a table next to a gas canister overnight as a human shield. Staff member Zakir Hossain Shaon is injured and bloodied as he escapes and is detained by law enforcement officials. He later dies in custody while being treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.

The key doesn't work. He is then told to open the collapsible gate and leave. He opens it and returns. The staff, suffocating in the bathroom outside, start banging the door in desperation. Militants hear the commotion and send one of the waiters to fetch the staff locked in the staff bathroom. As they are released, four manage to run away. The other five are brought inside. The hostages at Table 7 are given back their mobile phones and allowed to leave. As they leave, Nibras says: “We are going to die.

Asked why they do not file complaints, he said: “We know it very well that recovery of our money is impossible as the crimes are committed by those who are supposed to be our protectors.”On January 9 this year, Bangladesh Bank Assistant Director Golam Rabbi were brutally tortured by Mohammadpur police station’s Sub-Inspector Masud Sikder and was reportedly threatened with killing in crossfire when he refused to pay the police official Tk500,000. The same month, some patrol police members tortured Dhaka South City Corporation Inspector Bikash Chandra Dash in Dholairpar area. The only “fault” of Bikash was that he was ordered by the police officer to pull over but he was a little late to do so. On November 17, a lawyer named Shahjahan Molla filed a case with a Dhaka court, accusing a police sergeant of extorting money from him by seizing his motorbike documents. Involvement of a section of law enforcers in such criminal acts, including abduction for money, extortion and narcotics smuggling, has now become a matter of great concern for city dwellers, say sources at the Police Headquarters, criminologists and human rights experts. Usually most of the complaints are filed against officials ranked between constables and sub-inspectors; however, the number of complaints against inspectors and assistant superintendents of police is no less, data from the Police Headquarters suggest. According to experts, police officials’ tendency to consider themselves above the law has worsened the law and order in Bangladesh to some extent. Experts think suspension and other low-intensity departmental actions do not work in combating crimes by police. According to the police ordinance, the authorities can take different types of actions against an accused police official including reprimand and suspension. Major punishments for policemen include suspension, forced retirement, demotion, cancellation of increment and cancellation of rank badge while punishments for petty crimes include salary deduction and reprimand or warning. According to Police Headquarters, a total of 61 officials have been suspended from their job during January-August of the current year. Of them, five were sent on forced retirement while the rest have faced only suspension. During these eight months around 8,736 officials – from constables to sub-inspectors – have had to face light punishments while 363 have been handed out major punishments besides suspension. According to the security cell of the Police Headquarters, a total of 623 police officials were suspended permanently in the past six years: 72 were sent on forced retirement while 551 faced suspension. Of these 623 officials, 608 are constables and sub-inspectors, two inspectors and 13 are assistant superintendents of police. During this period, a total of 71,770 police officials have been given light punishment while major punishment was ensured for 4,033. The number of suspension was 76 in 2015 while it was 80 the previous year, 76 in 2013, 188 in 2012, and 127 in 2011, the data of the security cell shows. Police Headquarters sources said the number of allegations of criminal activities against police is much higher as the data does not provide how many complaints it has received; it rather only illustrates how many of the officials are punished after probe found them guilty. The other reason as to why the data cannot display the correct figure of crimes committed by police is most of the victims do not want to take the risk of filing complaints against police fearing further harassment, the sources added. Asked why top officials are not being punished, the Police Headquarters sources said it is the Home Ministry that can punish ASPs and other upper level officials. “The Police Headquarters has only the authority to adopt recommendations to the Home Ministry to take action,” said a source. Criminologists and human rights experts told the Dhaka Tribune that the culture of impunity has led to this situation. Dhaka University criminology department Chairman Zia Rahman said such incidents of crime continue to go on as police officials are rarely tried for their crimes. Crimes committed by police also came up during a live Facebook discussion on November 2 with Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia answering questions. As people from different strata of society raised the allegations of involvement of police crimes, Asaduzzaman Mia said: “I am not saying police do not extort money. People from other professionals also do. But the police high-ups regularly monitor so that police do not extort money. Stern action would be taken if allegation against any official is found true.” When approached by the Dhaka Tribune former chairman of the National Human Rights Commission Mizanur Rahman said incidents of impunity inspire the police to be more careless, which ultimately leads to more crimes by them. “To ensure public safety, repetition of such incidents should be stopped immediately and all the criminals should be brought to justice,” he said. The former NHRC boss recommended continuous surveillance and bringing the offenders to justice to curb such crimes. Inspector General of Police AKM Shahidul Hoque said the number of such officials is very small and the authorities take strict measures against those found guilty of crimes. Home Affairs Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal also said no one would be spared if found guilty. Actions will be taken against guilty people under the existing law of the country, he added. The Anti-Corruption Commission has recently asked the government to constitute a Criminal Justice Commission as a watchdog to monitor police actions to make sure that people get justice. In its annual report for 2015 submitted to President Abdul Hamid on October 24, the commission says there is no effective mechanism in place to monitor the internal activities of the police force and take necessary actions accordingly on receiving complaints from people.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 980, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:14:50.363135"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/crime/6340/half-of-narcotics-cases-end-in-acquittal", "title": "Half of narcotics cases end in acquittal", "body": "About 54% of those arrested in drug related cases filed by the Department of Narcotics Control in the past five years have gotten acquitted. Up to July this year, 954 cases were filed against 1,174 people, of whom 636 people were acquitted and 538 were sentenced. Of all the cases that were tried, 420 ended in conviction and 534 were dismissed. Around 51,000 cases are still pending, according to numbers released recently by the DNC. People concerned alleged that the high rate of acquittals was happening because of weak investigations, FIRs and charge sheets filed improperly. “The court pronounces a judgement on the basis of evidence – often obtained from the depositions of witnesses. But we often find witnesses absent from the court,” Public Prosecutor Abu Abdullah told the Dhaka Tribune. “Some who were made witnesses by the investigators on the case gave statements against the charges. Investigators often even failed to present the evidence,” he added. The lawyer said weak FIRs, poor investigation and improper charge sheet, all may contribute to the failure of the drugs cases.On the basis of experience and observation of narcotics trials, Abu Abdullah said most of the time the investigator does not give importance to the selection of witnesses. “They will pick bystanders or passersby as witnesses. As a result, the court cannot find the person when it is time for witness statements. May be they have moved somewhere else, changed their addresses. To resolve such issues the investigator could take the mobile phone number of the witnesses. That way it may at least be possible for us to find the witnesses,” he added. Mostafizur Rahman, assistant director (operations) of the Department of Narcotics Control, told the Dhaka Tribune that they had limited manpower with which to handle all duties. “Sometimes the accused is released for weak investigation. But the investigators are always trying to do their best to place the witnesses and evidence properly in the court. However, sometimes it may not be enough,” he said. “To ensure that the accused get punished, we are trying to increase manpower to develop the quality of our investigation.” DNC officials said they cannot always pay attention to proper investigation due to manpower shortage and since they are occupied with many other tasks. According to the department of Narcotics Control statistics, in the last five years the case dismissal rate increased by 12% and correspondingly the number of acquittals increased. Last year, the DNC filed 1,873 cases and scored convictions in only 892 of them. In these cases 971 people were convicted, which was 48.2% of the total. The rest were acquitted, which was 51.8% of the total. In 2014, 2,689 cases were filed whereas conviction was handed out in 1,716 cases. Among the cases, 1,175 people had been convicted, which was 52% of the total. In 2013, the department filed 2,066 cases and got 1,127 convictions. In those cases 1,218 people were found guilty, which was 54% of the total. In 2012, 3,494 cases were filed and 1,846 cases ended in convictions. In them, 1,860 people were convicted, which is 53% of the total. However, mobile courts operating under the Department have had a better rate of success. Until August this year, the mobile courts carried out 9,404 drives and filed 4,473 cases and convicted 4,612 people. In 2015, the mobile courts carried out 14,937 drives, filed 7487 cases and convicted 7,823 people. In 2014, there were 14,815 drives, 7,948 cases and 8,320 convicts and in 2013, 9,679 drives, 5,244 cases and 5,445 convicts.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 589, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:14:52.672640"}

Despite the drink’s popularity, coffee was never commercially produced in Bangladesh, not until now. The situation has been gradually changing in recent years as people living in the hilly areas have started producing coffee, though on small scale. The locally produced product has already earned a moniker – the Hill Tract Blend. Fonkal Bawm is one of the farmers who has taken an interest in coffee plantation. “I sold my first harvest of 80kg for Tk10,400 to a customer from Dhaka last year. I grew them on 25 trees,” he told the Dhaka Tribune when this correspondent visited his plantation recently. Inspired by the profit, this year, he has planted coffee seedlings on five acres of new land. It will take approximately four years for the newly planted coffee trees to bear fruit. There is typically one major harvest a year. Coffee trees does not require separate land as they can be planted alongside other crops on the same plot. Fonkal planted around 5,000 coffee trees in his five-acre orchard where he produces crops like papya and pineapple. A number of indigenous communities have been living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts – Khagrachhari, Bandarbans and Rangamati – for a long time. Among them, the Bawm community has long been growing coffee at their homes since they drink it daily. Commercial coffee production in the area got an unexpected boost when the “North End Coffee Roasters,” a popular coffee shop in Dhaka, started procuring coffee from the locals. The cafe introduced it as “Hill Tracts Blend,” an official of the North End said. Apart from the Bawm, other indigenous communities have taken an interest in coffee plantation thanks to the patronisation of different non-government organisations including Arannayak Foundation and Moanoghar.“We trained 51 Mro and Khumi families in Bandarban and gave them 15,300 seedlings this year to promote coffee cultivation,” Kirti Nishan Chakma, general secretary of Moanoghar, said. “We hope the coffee trees will bear fruits after four to five years. We plan to buy coffee from them at fair price and introduce the product in markets at home and abroad,” he added. Kirti said their efforts aim at ensuring socio-economic improvement of the hilly communities as well as setting up a secured marketplace for coffee producers in Bangladesh. In addition, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute has been running a pilot project to promote coffee in the Khagrachhari for the last few years. Department of Agriculture Extension Director General Md Hamidur Rahman told the Dhaka Tribune: “The government’s endeavour is still in the piloting phase. If we are successful, the government will promote coffee cultivation and its marketing in the hill tracts.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 467, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:14:55.284249"}

No group or individual officially claimed responsibility for last night's attack as of 2am. In the attacks, the main suspects were the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). On different occasions, both groups have claimed to have carried out attacks on Bangladeshi soil. But the Bangladesh government has denied the groups' presence in the country, blaming most of the attacks on Jamaat-inspired extremists instead. Although RAB chief Benazir Ahmed briefed media soon after the incident, he did not comment on the identities of the attackers. Sumon Reza, a supervisor at the bakery who escaped the attack, told reporters that the attackers were shouting “Allahu Akbar” while entering the shop. He saw two attackers and both of them appeared to be under 30. They had small firearms and at least one attacker was carrying a sharp weapon. Commenting on the latest attack, Rita Katz, co-founder of the SITE Intelligence Group that regularly reports on militant activities in Bangladesh, tweeted: “Clash in #Bangladesh different than all past #ISIS & #AQIS attacks there so far. A dangerous precedent in the country.” John Kirby, US state department spokesman, also weighed in on the hostage situation. “The situation’s ongoing, obviously – too early for us to say who’s involved, motivation, any of that stuff,” he said. Soon after the attack, an unofficial twitter account claiming to belong to @Ansar_Islam_BD tweeted: “Operation has started in #Gulshan, #Bangladesh. Few foreign diplomatics (crusader) have been taking [sic] hostage in a hotel.” The account later twitted: “It will be first in #Bangladesh to attack in diplomatic zone, taking hostage and largest operation against the crusaders and its allies.” The authenticity of the account could not be verified. Meanwhile, just hours before the attack in Gulshan, IS yesterday claimed responsibilities for the murder of two people – one in Jhenaidah and another in Bandarban. Since September last year, the group has claimed 24 attacks killing 20 people, mostly non-Muslim and non-Sunni preachers and foreigners. On the other hand, AQIS claimed 13 attacks since 2013 killing 11 people, most of whom are secular bloggers and LGBT activists.The United States yesterday designated AQIS as a terrorist organisation and its leader Asim Umar as a global terrorist for their activities in South Asia.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 399, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:14:57.623247"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/492/the-forsaken-communities-of-thanchi", "title": "The forsaken communities of Thanchi", "body": "The indigenous people in some of the most remote areas of Bangladesh live in a state of limbo; no one is willing to take responsibility for their well-being. Toiling everyday in the jhum fields in the remote hills, most of them have resigned to the fact that neither they nor their children would get any basic education or healthcare services during their lifetime. In a place where the nearest school or medical facility is almost a day's journey away, there is hardly any option to avail such basic human rights. If you hire an engine-boat and start a journey upstream in the Sangu River from Thanchi, you will come across only two or three schools in the local bazars. But Andharmanik – which is two days of boat journey away from Thanchi – is the last frontier; beyond here, there is no government or NGO-run education or medical facilities. Illiteracy and the lack of health awareness are invisible chains tethering the future of these communities. In the absence of opportunities, jhum cultivation becomes their only choice of living. The Dhaka Tribune recently visited remote areas in Thanchi's Remakree union to find that almost no children went to school and no one had access to medical services.Jhum cultivation for kidsThe kids in the remote indigenous communities either spent their time working in the jhum fields with their parents or by playing on the yards and the river. In the remote community of Young Naung Para, locals said in the history of the village there had been only one boy who managed to study up to HSC exams, but had to leave his own house to finish his education at a college in Bandarban's Ali Kadam upazila. The village head, Young Naung Karbari, told the Dhaka Tribune that around 15 children of the village have studied up to class two; but to do attend classes, they had to walk to the next village of Katangia Para where an NGO named Karitas Light House had a small school. In Loyakree Para, there is a school for 28 households. But only two children study there in class two. The school was informally set up in 2014 by the Turtle Research Centre, but villagers said the students had no books or paper. However, not all remote communities have the chance to send their kids to school. Mo Bayu, head of Malungia Para, said there was no school or healthcare facility for his village or the villages nearby. So, all children joined their parents in the jhum fields. Kayingpre Mro of May Thowaing Para, and Kya Swe Pru Karbari of Mro Gong Para said their villages shared similar fates. Ranglang Murong said education can change the face of the area and shape a better future for the children, who now had no other choice but to work in the fields. “No one from the union parishad comes to help us because we live in such a remote place. There is no one here who gets their basic rights,” said Silo Tripura of Surjyamoni Para.Jungle medicine and family planningIn the hard-to-reach areas of the upazila, there are many people who have never even seen a doctor in their lifetimes. Forty-two-year-old Kya Swe Pru Karbari of Mro Gong Para told the Dhaka Tribune that it was only three years ago when he first visited a doctor for a blood test. Water-borne diseases are endemic in the region, while many children suffer from skin diseases. Even in cases of severe sickness, they have to rely on herbs and jungle medicine for cure. Apart from the obvious dilemmas of not having a doctor or medical facility nearby, the remote regions of Bandarban face another crisis – the lack of family planning awareness. “We have 11 households in our village, with each family having around six or more children,” Kya Swe said. “A child died during birth last month in the village. The mother was lucky to survive. She has six children; of them, three have died from diseases,” he added. Ren Chang Mro, a 27-year-old father of five from Loyakree Para, said the size of families was only getting bigger as people in the remote areas have no idea about birth control. “As a result, many problems arise. For example, we have many mouths to feed, meaning more crops have to be cultivated in a bigger land,” he said. Eighty-five-year-old Rui Moun has spent half of her life providing midwifery services to Young Noung Para. Rui, who never had any formal training in midwifery, admits it has been a tough journey as she had seen many deaths during childbirth.

The cases under labour law are still not being approved. There is a lack of coordination among us. Initially, these cases were managed carefully, with accountability from the authorities, but later, for some reason, they are being transferred from one bench to another.\"\n\nShe added: \"For the main case hearing, everyone needs to work in a coordinated manner and participate in the monitoring process. Even as a lawyer, human rights activist, and organizer, I have not been able to play an effective role in this matter. To ensure justice, the necessary steps are—punishment through criminal law, uncovering the truth, and providing compensation and rehabilitation.\"\n\nThe head of the Labour Reform Commission, Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmed, commented that the biggest failure in the Rana Plaza incident is that justice, compensation, and rehabilitation processes are still incomplete.\n\nHe said: \"One failure leads to many others. We should establish this incident as a national issue, so that judges can say they are ready to deliver a verdict.\"\n\nHe further said: \"The trial of such cases can be completed within a year or a maximum of 26 months, if given due importance. He urged to start the judicial process from tomorrow and ensure the treatment and compensation for the affected workers in major hospitals.\"\n\nThe president of the Bangladesh Socialist Workers Front, Rajekuzzaman Ratan, said: \"The reality of impunity in Bangladesh is exemplified by the promises made by the ruling class and the people's disbelief in those promises.\"\n\nHe added: \"Through the past 12 years of non-judgment, we have understood what impunity is and how judicial processes are deliberately prolonged.\"\n\nHe further said: \"Although we have tall labour buildings, there is no effective system in place for workers to sit, seek justice, or demand their rights.\"\n\nRegarding the workers affected by the Rana Plaza incident, he said: \"The safety fund should ensure the protection of workers. If a worker dies, their family should not be left helpless. For injured workers, they should not be forced to become beggars due to disability.\"\n\nRajekuzzaman Ratan called for ensuring fair rights and protection for workers.\n\nMohammad Barkat Ali, Director (Law) of BLAST, stated: \"The workers did not want to work that day; rather, they were forced to join work. This cannot truly be called an accident.\"\n\nHe said: \"We should not just publicize the Rana Plaza collapse on one day. If it is publicized step by step, it will draw the attention of the higher authorities.\"\n\nOther speakers at the event included Sharmin Sultana, panel lawyer of BLAST and vice president of the Labour Court Bar Association; Taslima Akhter, president of Bangladesh Garment Workers' Solidarity; Md Masum Billah, legal officer, Department of Factory and Establishment Inspection; and Abul Hossain, president of Textile Garment Workers Federation.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the Rana Plaza building collapsed at 8:45am on April 24, 2013, near a bus station in Savar.

Yet, as school and university ended, I was haunted by the fear of not being able to continue dancing. The regret of never officially learning a classical form of dance lingered.\n\nThankfully, I came across Arthy Ahmed Dance Academy. It was not just a lifeline for me but also for countless women who had dreamt of dancing in their childhood but couldn’t pursue it for various reasons.\n\nNow, 90 such women are coming together for \"Sakhi.\" Brac Bank TARA presents \"Sakhi,” a heartfelt dance recital featuring women who have reconnected with their passion for dance. These adult beginners, coming from diverse professional paths, are now fulfilling their childhood dreams, united by the power of movement and the bonds of sisterhood.\n\n\"Sakhi\" will take place on Friday at 6:30pm, with gates opening at 6pm. The venue for this grand recital is the Chhayanaut Auditorium.\n\nDirected by Arthy Ahmed and with music directed by Nirjher Chowdhury, \"Sakhi\" promises to be a memorable celebration of dance and sisterhood.\n\nArthy Ahmed decided early in her life that dance would be her calling. She started dancing at the age of three and dedicated her education and career to this art form.\n\nAfter securing an ICCR scholarship, she trained extensively in Bharatnatyam, completing both her BA and MA in Bharatnatyam from Rabindra Bharati University.\n\nShe further enriched her expertise with a Diploma in Teacher’s Training in Dance Education, majoring in Dance Psychology, from Madras University.\n\nIn a candid discussion with Dhaka Tribune, Arthy talked about her journey. During the pandemic, she noticed that many adults wanted to learn dance but felt self-conscious about doing so in classes with children or were intimidated by the process.\n\nThis realization inspired her to design a course specifically for adult beginners.\n\nThe course was crafted to cater to adults, focusing on convenient timings and breaking down steps to make the first move less daunting. “What started with 25 students in Batch 1 has now grown into a thriving community of over 400 members after 14 batches,” said Arthy.\n\nSariya Sadeque, a student whose Bharatnatyam journey began two and a half years ago, shared her experience: “Arthy is a great teacher who knows how to address different challenges in her students. More importantly, she loves to give her students a platform to grow and showcase their work.”\n\nSpeaking about gender disparity in classical dance, Arthy emphasized that art forms, behaviours, hobbies, and preferences should not be confined by gender.\n\nTalking about her future plans for adult beginners, she said: “Many of my students have fallen in love with dance. They’re now performing on different platforms. My success lies in transforming someone who once thought they could never dance into a professional dancer. But, learning dance doesn’t mean you have to turn professional; it’s about loving, appreciating, and understanding the art. I want to ensure that no one’s dream of learning dance goes unfulfilled.”\n\nTalking about \"Sakhi,\" Arthy reflected on the impact of \"Riturongo,\" her earlier productions, and how she chose the theme of sisterhood.\n\nShe dedicates this performance to the friendships formed in her courses, particularly as such bonds are rare to form after school or university.\n\nThe theme of 'Sakhi' celebrates these friendships, the connections forged between women from different ages and professions. It’s a tribute to the power of camaraderie and shared dreams.\n\nArthy said: “I hope the audience leaves inspired, cherishing their friendships and realizing that it’s never too late to start pursuing what they love. If these 90 women can learn to dance after so many years, you too can chase your dreams.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 611, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:18:13.554491"}

As a result, some passengers are taking between one and one-and-a-half hours to clear immigration.\n\nOfficials said in many cases the visa application link and password are required to verify e-visas, information most passengers do not have readily available. In such situations, immigration officers contact the embassies of the visa-issuing countries by phone to confirm details before allowing passengers to proceed.\n\nThey added that many countries issuing e-visas do not email confirmation details or upload information to designated websites, forcing immigration officials to seek verification manually, which further delays passenger clearance.\n\nAn immigration officer at HSIA told Dhaka Tribune that all personnel working at the e-visa counters receive basic immigration training and denied allegations of harassment. “There is no scope for immigration harassment,” the officer said, adding that daily passenger inflow is high and extra vigilance has been imposed to prevent people smuggling, illegal immigration and other crimes.\n\nPassengers, however, reported facing difficulties.\n\nOn January 6, passengers checking in at the international terminal of HSIA were seen standing in long queues at airline counters due to limited space. Several passengers complained of discomfort as the terminal was crowded and air conditioning was turned off because of cold weather.\n\nAt the immigration area, a separate counter was set up for e-visa verification, where long queues had formed.\n\nSarowardi Hasan, who was traveling to Bangkok with his family, said immigration officials asked him to wait for visa verification. “They asked for the visa application link and password. I told them to check the barcode, but they said the barcode does not contain all the information,” he said, adding that he waited for nearly an hour and feared missing his flight.\n\nJournalist Asaduzzaman Biku, who traveled to Brazil last November to cover a climate conference, said he and several other journalists faced complications during visa verification at immigration. “The police questioned us several times and argued with us,” he said.\n\nHe said an immigration officer told them Bangladeshis rarely travel to Brazil, which made officials suspicious. “Later, they verified our visas and allowed us to travel,” he added.\n\nBiku alleged that despite having modern visa-checking equipment, immigration officials sometimes harass passengers and, in some cases, accept bribes when discrepancies are found in travel documents.\n\nBusinessman Shahjahan Kabir Liton, who recently traveled to Bangkok for business, made similar allegations. “There is no justification for harassment at immigration. It is a tactic to extract money,” he said.\n\nLiton added that in most countries e-visa verification through barcodes takes no more than five minutes. “Our immigration police need better training. Their technological skills are weak,” he said.\n\nHazrat Shahjalal International Airport Executive Director Group Captain SM Ragib Samad told Dhaka Tribune that airport authorities had not received any formal complaints regarding passenger harassment. “Action will be taken if complaints are received,” he said.\n\nAviation expert Kazi Wahidul Alam said he learned about visa-related complications through his work with passengers. “The reality is that immigration police lack adequate technical skills and proper training,” he said.\n\nHe added that the digital devices used for visa verification at the airport are insufficient compared to current operational needs and that improving technical capacity is essential to reduce delays.\n\nAn e-visa is a digital visa that can be applied for online through the website of a specific country. Applicants can submit documents, make payments and complete the process online without visiting an embassy. Once approved, the visa is sent by email and can be printed for travel.\n\nMany countries have introduced e-visas or Electronic Travel Authorizations (ETA) to expedite travel procedures.

While the gain reflects modest progress, the country still remains among the bottom eight worldwide.\n\nAccording to the index, Bangladeshis currently enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 37 destinations. In the previous ranking, Bangladesh was placed 100th.\n\nThe Henley Passport Index, prepared by London-based global citizenship and immigration consultancy Henley & Partners using data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), ranks passports based on the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa.\n\nAt the top of the latest ranking, Singapore retains its position as the world’s most powerful passport, with visa-free access to 192 of 227 countries and territories. Japan and South Korea jointly occupy second place, allowing entry to 188 destinations without a visa.\n\nFive European countries—Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland—are tied for third place, each with access to 186 destinations. A further 10 European countries share fourth place with access to 185 destinations, while Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) rank fifth with 184 destinations.\n\nThe UAE has recorded the strongest rise in the 20-year history of the index, moving up 57 places since 2006 after adding 149 visa-free destinations, a development attributed to sustained diplomatic efforts and visa liberalisation policies.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Afghanistan remains the weakest passport globally, with visa-free access to just 24 destinations. Syria and Iraq also rank near the bottom.\n\nThe gap between the strongest and weakest passports now stands at 168 destinations.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Christian H Kaelin, chairman of Henley & Partners and creator of the index, said that while global mobility has increased significantly over the past two decades, its benefits remain unevenly distributed.\n\n“Passport privileges today play a major role in shaping opportunity, security and economic participation,” he said, adding that mobility advantages are increasingly concentrated in wealthier and more politically stable countries.\n\nThe index highlights gradual progress for countries like Bangladesh, but also underscores the persistent challenges faced by citizens of lower-ranked nations in accessing global mobility.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 357, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:19:16.955189"}

According to the European Commission, Bangladesh now ranks third in terms of political asylum applications. Under the new migration policy, rejected applicants will be sent back to their home countries. With a 96% rejection rate for Bangladeshi asylum seekers, officials anticipate that deportations from Europe will rise.\n\nThis year, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) carried out its first chartered deportation flight to Dhaka in March, sending back more than 60 Bangladeshis.\n\nThe Bangladesh Embassy in Greece reported that deportees on that flight came from several EU countries--two from Italy, nine from Romania, two from the Czech Republic, three from France, two from Malta, four from Spain, two from Sweden, and 20 from Cyprus.\n\nAll of them had their asylum claims rejected. This marked the first forced return flight of the year for Bangladeshi nationals.\n\nOne returnee from Greece said he had been detained in a camp in Athens for seven to eight months, where thousands of Bangladeshis remain in custody.\n\nAccording to sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka, on Thursday, a further 29 Bangladeshis were returned from Greece, Italy, and Cyprus to Bangladesh on an EU-chartered flight.\n\nThe flight, which transited through Islamabad, arrived in Dhaka at 8am on Thursday. Among the returnees, 16 were from Italy, nine from Greece, and four from Cyprus. While these 29 have arrived in Dhaka, it is not yet known when the remaining individuals will return.\n\nThe Bangladesh Embassy in Italy reported that of the 16 deportees from Italy, 13 had been involved in various crimes, including robbery, pickpocketing, theft, and drug-related offences.\n\nBangladeshis are also being deported from the United Kingdom. On August 29, under the supervision of the UK Home Office, nine Bangladeshis were returned on a chartered flight.\n\nHowever, detailed information about them has not been released by immigration authorities. This was the first deportation flight from the UK involving Bangladeshi nationals.\n\nAfter months of discussion, the European Union (EU) unveiled a new plan last March to expedite the return of irregular migrants to their home countries. In recent years, the EU has been under pressure to tighten its migration policies.\n\nThe European Commission has proposed the creation of “return centres” or “return hubs.” While some member states support the initiative, human rights organizations have strongly criticized it.\n\nAt present, fewer than 20% of irregular migrants in EU member states are deported. To increase this rate, Brussels is urging member states to take swift action.\n\nUnder the EU’s plan, member states will be allowed to establish migrant centres outside the EU. Individuals whose asylum applications have been rejected, and who are under a legal obligation to leave, will be sent to these new return hubs. The EU itself will not operate the centres, leaving the responsibility to member states.\n\nThe legal framework of the centres will comply with international law. Those who refuse to leave Europe may face measures such as sanctions, confiscation of identity documents and detention. Decisions made in one member-state will also be enforceable in others. For example, a ruling in Austria will apply in Spain.\n\nRegarding the EU’s new plan, an official at the Bangladesh Embassy in Greece, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that many asylum seekers currently move to another country after their applications are rejected. “Under the new rules, that option will no longer be available,” the official added.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs say that European countries began reforming their asylum policies following the large influx of migrants. After several years of effort, the European Parliament approved the policy reforms last year.\n\nUnder this framework, political asylum applications will be processed more quickly, enabling the rapid return of rejected applicants to their home countries.\n\nMigration expert Dr Mohammad Jalal Uddin Sikder, a lecturer at North South University, told Bangla Tribune: “Post-Covid, countries facing economic downturns had to cut their budgets. Those residing as refugees or applying for political asylum require additional social services and budget allocations, which the EU cannot fully provide.”\n\nHe added: “As a result, the processing for legally admitted migrants is slow, while asylum seekers are deprived of social services.”\n\nHe noted that the Russia–Ukraine war has increased military budgets in the EU, as countries must fund both Nato obligations and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, placing additional pressure on member states.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on September 10 said the process of sending back rejected asylum seekers to their home countries needs to be expedited.\n\nShe said: “We must be more responsible in returning rejected asylum seekers to their home countries. It should not be the case that only 20% of those who have no legal right to remain in Europe are being returned.”\n\nAccording to EU data, 96% of political asylum applications by Bangladeshis are rejected. Between January 1, 2024 and June 2025, a total of 57,550 Bangladeshi citizens applied for asylum for the first time. The success rate for Bangladeshi applicants in 2024 was only 4%. As of May 2025, 45,129 Bangladeshi applications were still pending.\n\nThe data further reveal that in June this year, France, Italy, and Greece increased the rate of processing asylum claims. Officials believe that the faster the decisions are made, the higher the number of Bangladeshis who will eventually be repatriated.\n\nOn September 10, Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury met with European Commission Director for Migration and Asylum Michael Shotter. The director made it known that anti-immigration political pressures inside EU member states are steadily rising.\n\nHe expressed concern over the significant number of Bangladeshi citizens attempting to enter EU countries illegally and urged Bangladesh to work with the EU to address the issue.\n\nMichael Shotter also held a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on migration issues, where he again discussed the matter of returning illegal migrants. However, the ministry did not make any formal statement regarding the discussion.\n\nA responsible official at the ministry said Bangladesh has always discouraged illegal migration.\n\nRegarding the meeting, on September 11, the European Union mission in Bangladesh stated that migration management is a top priority for the EU. It said the union supports safe and dignified regular migration for Bangladeshis and is intensifying efforts to prevent illegal entry into Europe.\n\nThe mission added that this week, a high-level EU delegation, including representatives from the European Commission, the EU border control agency, and member states, is visiting Dhaka. Discussions are focusing on repatriation and reintegration, legal processes, border control, visa issuance, and measures against human trafficking and smuggling.\n\nFrom 2023 up to last August, more than 3,500 Bangladeshis have been returned from Europe, with around 1,500 of them repatriated over the past year from various European countries. The highest numbers have come from Italy, Cyprus, Romania, Germany, Greece, and Malta.\n\nThe non-governmental organization Brac has been working with Frontex on cases involving Bangladeshis returning from Europe. Asked about the returnees, Shariful Hasan, associate director of Brac’s Migration and Youth Platform, declined to provide specific figures.\n\nHowever, he said: “Bangladesh does not encourage irregular migration. That is why in 2017, the Bangladesh government signed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with the European Union. Under this framework, Brac works jointly with the EU and Frontex to provide counselling and economic support for the welfare and sustainable reintegration of Bangladeshis who return.”\n\nHe added: “In this way, over the past few years, about 3,500 Bangladeshis returning from Europe have received financial support. Anyone newly returning will also receive this assistance. However, everyone should refrain from irregular migration or attempting to go abroad by sea. Bangladesh ranks first in the world for people trying to reach Europe irregularly across the Mediterranean, which is a matter of national shame.”", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1303, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:19:20.642962"}

Without an assured fuel supply, local production will be affected,” he told reporters after separate meetings of the Advisers Council Committee on Public Purchase and the Advisers Council Committee on Economic Affairs at the Secretariat.\n\n“There are two dimensions—power and energy. A comprehensive approach has been taken. This includes offshore drilling initiatives and the utilization of coal including domestic coal resources. All these have been consolidated into a single framework,” he said.\n\nResponding to another question over the interim government’s success, the adviser said it is not that everything has been done or that we have achieved 100 out of 100.\n\n“Definitely, there were expectations we could not meet due to limitations,” he said, citing procedural rules, the need for inter-agency coordination, the role of government officials, the availability of skilled manpower, and commitment as key challenges.\n\n“Without addressing these, implementation cannot happen just because we planned or wanted it,” he added.\n\nResponding to a recent Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) report claiming advisers exercise more power than formal institutions, Dr Salehuddin said such narratives are common and not unusual.\n\n“Sometimes people speak louder, sometimes less. It is not correct to say nothing has been done, nor is it correct to claim everything has been achieved. There are realities and constraints,” he said.\n\nOn reports that some countries, including Iran and Nepal, were reluctant to engage economically with Bangladesh, he said he was unaware of the specific context but insisted Bangladesh’s overall economic position remains stable.\n\n“Bangladesh is being viewed positively by many. For example, in terms of SDG financing, even the United Nations says Bangladesh has the capacity to mobilise funds and that other countries follow when Bangladesh agrees,” he said.\n\n“Bangladesh is doing quite well. There may be occasional political or economic shocks but no country develops in a straight line. Economic progress is never linear anywhere,” he added.\n\nAddressing concerns over persistently high inflation, Dr Salehuddin said, “High inflation is not just about supply and demand, nor can it be solved simply by increasing the policy rate. Supply-side issues, market dynamics, people’s behavior, cooperation, and above all governance play a major role,” he said.\n\nPrices can’t be controlled simply by sending inspectors or magistrates and that does not work anywhere, he added.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 419, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:19:58.199279"}
{"url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/government-affairs/400279/energy-ministry-adequate-lpg-stock-artificial", "title": "Energy ministry: Adequate LPG stock, artificial shortage behind price spike", "body": "The Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources has said there is no shortage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in the country and has instructed the administration to take legal action against those responsible for creating an artificial crisis in the market.\n\nThe information was shared in a press release issued on Sunday following an emergency meeting between the ministry and stakeholders in the LPG sector, amid reports of abnormal price hikes and widespread unavailability of cylinders at the retail level.\n\nAccording to the release, it has been observed that LPG prices at the retail stage have risen sharply beyond normal levels. Taking the matter seriously, the ministry convened the emergency meeting at 3pm at the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, chaired by the Energy Division secretary, with leaders of the LPG Owners Association, operators and relevant officials.\n\nDuring the meeting, the ongoing LPG situation was reviewed in detail, with priority given to restoring normalcy in the market.\n\nThe discussions revealed that the country currently has sufficient LPG stock, but local retailers have deliberately created an artificial shortage. While some challenges have emerged at the import stage—due to rising global prices, a shortage of vessels and sanctions imposed on certain cargo ships—officials said these factors do not justify the current market situation.\n\nAccording to official data, LPG imports stood at 1,05,000tons in November 2025, which increased to 1,27,000tons in December. “Despite higher imports, there is no logical reason for a decline in LPG supply in the market,” the release said.\n\nLeaders of the LPG Owners Association and importers told the meeting that some retailers withheld supplies in anticipation of a possible price hike by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) this month. On Sunday, BERC increased the price of a 12-kg LPG cylinder from Tk1,253 to Tk1,306.\n\nThe ministry also said initiatives have already been taken to address several demands raised by the LPG association in consideration of promoting green fuel, including simplifying letters of credit and reducing VAT, through discussions with the relevant authorities.\n\nIn this context, it was decided that the LPG Operators Association of Bangladesh would issue a statement on Sunday regarding the artificial shortage created in the market.\n\nTo normalize the situation, the Cabinet Division and the Ministry of Home Affairs have been requested to instruct district and upazila administrations to conduct mobile court operations against irregularities. The ministry expressed hope that these measures would help bring LPG prices back to normal quickly.\n\nDespite official assurances, consumers across Dhaka and its outskirts have been facing acute difficulties in obtaining LPG cylinders, often at exorbitant prices.\n\nOn the morning of Saturday, Aslam Mia went to a shop near his home in the Farmgate area after his LPG supply ran out. The retailer told him that cylinders were unavailable. After visiting several nearby shops and finding none in stock, he eventually managed to buy a 12-kg cylinder from another shop—but at a price of Tk2,300.\n\n“I had no option but to buy it,” Aslam said.\n\nAsked about the unusually high price, shopkeeper Azad claimed there was a severe shortage of LPG cylinders. “We are not getting cylinders from the dealers. I had only one cylinder left. I have been calling different places since morning, but I can’t find any more. Many retailers like us are facing the same problem,” he said.\n\nA similar situation has been reported in Savar. Tamiya Sultana, a resident of the Palli Bidyut area, said her LPG cylinder ran out on Wednesday. A nearby retailer quoted Tk1,860 for a 12-kg cylinder—significantly higher than previous prices. Unable to find cylinders elsewhere, she bought it at that rate. When she asked again on Saturday, she was told the price had risen further to Tk2,000.\n\nThe 12-kg cylinder is the most commonly used for household cooking, and prices have been rising steadily over the past two weeks. Several retailers said that despite placing orders, they are not receiving adequate supplies from dealers, leaving them unable to meet customer demand.\n\nExpressing concern over the situation, Selim Khan, president of the LPG Cylinder Distributors Association, said most companies have halted supplies, with only a handful currently operating at 20–30% of demand.\n\n“This has created a serious crisis,” he said.\n\nSelim said LPG demand rises globally during winter, pushing prices up, and Bangladesh is also facing an import vessel shortage. A total of 29 vessels used for LPG transportation have come under US sanctions, reducing import capacity. However, he stressed that increasing retail prices before any official government announcement was unjustified.\n\nPrices of larger cylinders have also surged. Mohammad Ibrahim, a resident of Mohammadpur’s Adabor area, said his family uses 36-kg cylinders due to their household size. He last bought one for Tk3,700, but the same cylinder was selling for Tk4,800 this week.\n\n“Sudden price hikes have left us frustrated, but we have no option,” he said, adding that consumers are being forced to pay an extra Tk1,100 for an essential fuel.\n\nResidents of Khilgaon, Dhanmondi, Basabo, Mirpur, Kalyanpur and Shahjahanpur reported going from shop to shop with money in hand, only to return empty-handed.\n\nDuring a visit to Shukrabad Bhanga Bazar in Dhanmondi, several retailers were seen making phone calls to dealers. Nuruzzaman, an LPG retailer there, said he had no cylinders to sell.\n\n“Several customers came to me since morning, but I had to turn them away because I have none,” he said, pointing to rows of empty cylinders outside his shop. “If we could buy cylinders at higher prices, we would sell them accordingly. But the real problem is that there are no cylinders at all. Such a severe crisis has never happened before.”\n\nTwo customers waiting nearby said they had come from Purba Rajabazar and Kalabagan after failing to find LPG in their own areas, only to be disappointed again.\n\nBERC is expected to announce new LPG prices on Sunday or Monday. According to BERC and the LPG Operators of Bangladesh (LOAB), winter-driven global demand and the ongoing vessel crisis have pushed up import and transportation costs. Bangladesh usually imports 130,000–140,000 tonnes of LPG per month, but only around 90,000 tonnes were imported in December.\n\nSince April 2021, BERC has been fixing LPG prices on a monthly basis. While complaints of overpricing have been common, officials say the current scale of disruption is unprecedented.\n\nLast Thursday, BERC sent a letter to LOAB after receiving complaints that LPG was being sold above the fixed December price of Tk104.41 per kg, or Tk1,253 for a 12-kg cylinder. Under BERC regulations, no entity involved in storage, bottling, distribution or retail is allowed to sell LPG above the fixed rate.\n\nBERC member (Gas) Md Mizanur Rahman said discussions were held last Thursday and further talks with the commission chairman are scheduled for Sunday.\n\n“Prices are usually announced on the first or second day of the month. Due to holidays, this month’s price announcement was delayed,” he said, adding that authorities would also examine whether licensed operators were operating at full capacity.\n\nSelling LPG above the government-fixed price is illegal, Rahman said, adding that deputy commissioners have been instructed to prevent illegal price hikes. He also said the suggestion to print government-fixed prices on cylinders would be discussed, noting that it could benefit consumers.", "date": null, "language": "en", "source": "dhaka_tribune", "category": "main", "tokens": 1205, "crawled_at": "2026-02-04T19:20:00.079556"}
