{"title": "Trump says Fed pick due on Friday after meeting Warsh at White House", "body": "President Donald Trump is expected to name a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday (30 January) after a White House meeting the previous day with former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, a Fed critic who has ​said the US central bank needs \"regime change\" to regain lost credibility. Trump told reporters at the Kennedy Center on Thursday that he would announce his choice the next ‌morning, and that it would be \"somebody that could have been there a few years ago ... I think it's going to be a very good choice. I hope so.\" Warsh, 55, had met with Trump at the White House, a source later told Reuters. In his first term, President Trump had passed over Warsh in favour of Powell, a choice he regretted when Powell would not cut interest rates as fast or deep as Trump urged. This time around Trump made support for lower rates one of his explicit criteria for a Fed chair candidate. Warsh, like the other three people identified by Trump officials as finalists for the job, ‌has said the Fed should be lowering rates more than it has. Trump's nomination of a Powell successor, who must be confirmed by the Senate, comes ​amid unprecedented presidential efforts to exert control over the Fed. Traditionally, the independence of the central bank from political pressure has been seen as key to its job to fight inflation. Trump's efforts include an attempt to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook in a case now before the Supreme Court, and a Department of Justice probe that Powell says is part of a broad attempt by the ‍administration to intimidate the Fed. Powell's chair term ends in May, and he has declined to say if he will take the unusual step of staying on as a Fed governor. Doing so would deny Trump another open Fed seat to fill and complicate the bank's leadership under a new chair. Powell's term as a member of the Board of Governors expires in 2028. Trump's promise of an announcement on Friday came hours after he had said he would ⁠make his choice public next week. A schedule for the president released by the White House late on Thursday did not point explicitly to such an event. The White House calendar for Trump showed a ‍late-morning executive order signing session and a mid-afternoon policy meeting. Intense scrutiny for Warsh Trump's Fed chair pick may face another challenge as well: One key lawmaker in Trump's Republican Party, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, has ‌threatened to block ‌any Fed nominees until the DOJ investigation is resolved. Warsh - who as Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 was then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's chief liaison to Wall Street during the 2008 financial crisis and a key proponent of tighter monetary policy - has said in recent months he believes Trump is right to press the central bank for steep interest-rate cuts. Warsh has also criticised the Fed for underestimating the inflation-busting potential of productivity growth supercharged by artificial intelligence. With a background on Wall Street, including as a partner in the office managing the wealth of investing giant Stanley Druckenmiller, and family ties to ⁠major Trump supporter Ron Lauder, Warsh will be ⁠under intense scrutiny to prove his independence ​from the president. While no White House insider, Warsh has been a confidant of the president and a guest at his Florida estate, and looks poised to push Trump's priorities as a \"shadow\" Fed chair until Powell's term ends in mid-May. A lawyer and a distinguished visiting fellow in economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Warsh has called for an overhaul of the central bank that would slim its balance sheet and ease banking regulation. He says that ‍shrinking the balance sheet would allow it to \"redeploy\" excess liquidity in financial markets to the real economy by lowering the Fed's policy rate. That's not an argument that has made headway at the current Fed, which cut rates three times in 2025 but this week left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the 3.50%-3.75% range and signalled no hurry to move lower any time soon. The central bank also recently stopped shrinking its balance sheet in line with its strategy of ​keeping banking reserves ample to make for better control over its policy rate. Other candidates for the Fed chair job ‍have included Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock's global fixed income business; Fed Governor Christopher Waller, one of two policymakers who dissented this week in the central bank's decision to keep rates unchanged; and White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, ​an unapologetic cheerleader for many of the president's orthodox-defying policies, including high tariffs and an immigration crackdown.

{"title": "Tigers have saved the Sundarbans: Nigel Alan Marven", "body": "Nigel Alan Marven is a British wildlife presenter, naturalist and filmmaker, best known for bringing global biodiversity stories to mainstream audiences through landmark television series such as Prehistoric Park, Ten Deadliest Snakes and Wild China. With decades of experience documenting endangered species and fragile ecosystems around the world, Marven has increasingly focused on conservation-led storytelling that highlights the role of local communities in protecting nature. Over the past year, he has visited Bangladesh several times while working on a new documentary, Wild Bangladesh, which explores the country's rich wildlife and conservation efforts. Mahfuz Russel interviewed Nigel on behalf of The Business Standard. You have visited Bangladesh several times over the past year. What is the reason for your visits? Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel We are making a new documentary called Wild Bangladesh. It is an extraordinary country — about the size of the UK — but one of the most densely populated in the world, with around 175 million people. The UK has about 65 million, yet even here there is still room for wildlife. What has impressed me most is meeting people like you who are passionate about saving what remains of Bangladesh's landscapes and wildlife. You still have elephants. The Sundarbans amazed me — most people do not realise that the majority of it is in Bangladesh, not India. You still have tigers, and a very rare bird called the masked finfoot, which used to be found across Southeast Asia but can now only be reliably seen in Bangladesh. So there is extraordinary wildlife here, and just as importantly, there are people deeply committed to protecting habitats and animals. So, you are making a documentary on Bangladesh's wildlife? Yes, it covers wildlife and a bit of culture as well. I went to the Spring Festival in Dhaka, which was brilliant. We filmed children singing in the Sundarbans and captured an amazing traditional practice where people fish with otters. It is slightly controversial — whether wild animals should be used in that way — but it is a long-standing tradition in Bangladesh, and it was fascinating to document. We also showed tiger patrol groups in the Sundarbans who scare tigers away from villages instead of killing them. There is very good public awareness around tigers now. In many ways, tigers have saved the Sundarbans. People understand that if tigers were not there, humans would encroach further and destroy the forest. The Sundarbans is an incredibly important habitat, and the tiger is its guardian. When will the documentary be released? We will finish it in June. We do not yet know where it will be broadcast globally, but we are very much hoping it will be shown on Bangladeshi television, so people here can appreciate the wonders that still exist in their own country. I have been rewilding the Pittachhara Forest in Khagrachhari Hill district for the past nine years. From your perspective, can it have a real impact on biodiversity? Absolutely. From what I have seen, the work being done at Pittachhara forest is extremely important. You have regenerated habitats that were previously oil palm plantations by removing the palms and replacing them with native vegetation. You are also engaging with landowners adjacent to the forest, and they are helping to protect wildlife. They no longer kill animals found here because they understand their importance. There is also a vision for eco-tourism, which is crucial. If eco-tourists come, local people can earn an income by protecting wildlife rather than exploiting it. People will not protect what they do not understand. Here, people have learnt that a live slow loris is worth more than a dead one. Hunting has stopped because communities now see slow lorises as charming, endangered animals worth preserving. Do you think projects like Pittachhara conservation can have long term impact, even from a global perspective? Very much so. Protecting small pockets of land is essential. Pittachhara is about 40 hectares. We are here in the dry season, which is not the best time for wildlife — I would love to return during the monsoon. Even so, 26 species of snakes have been recorded in this small area. There are fantastic birds here, including pittas that return during the rainy season, and even now I have seen species I have never seen before. There is also a very rare bird, the Cachar bulbul, which is almost unique to Bangladesh, extending slightly into Myanmar. Birdwatchers from around the world would love to see it. This area is a real biodiversity hotspot, particularly in this corner of Bangladesh. If neighbouring landowners also protect their forests, there could eventually be a large enough area to support species such as clouded leopards returning. If a wildlife corridor could be created between India and Bangladesh adjacent to Pittachhara Forest, just four to five kilometres away, would that help? That would be fantastic. Wildlife corridors are being created all over the world. For example, between South Africa and Mozambique, fences have been removed to create vast landscapes for animals. Of course, Bangladesh is smaller and faces many challenges — climate change, population pressure, livelihoods—but it is incredibly encouraging that people are still committed to wildlife conservation. What is one unique thing you liked about Pittachhara Forest? The enthusiasm — yours and your team's. We spent New Year's Eve together, and everyone was so optimistic about conservation. Habitat regeneration here is genuinely impressive. Agricultural land is being restored with native vegetation, and you are already seeing species like buttonquail returning. This is true eco-tourism: solar power, natural water sources, waste management, and minimal environmental impact. You are not paying lip service to sustainability. This is one of the best examples of genuine eco-tourism I have seen. Do you have any advice for us? Honestly, just keep doing what you are doing. I hope I can help spread the word about Pittachhara's conservation. It is currently difficult for foreign visitors due to border sensitivities, but if regulations ease, this could become an extraordinary destination — not just for wildlife lovers, but for anyone who enjoys being in nature. Forest walking, or 'forest bathing', is very popular now in Japan and the UK. I can easily imagine yoga retreats here, overlooking the forest. Wildlife comes very close — squirrels, slow lorises, palm civets. Night safaris here are incredible. Most importantly, you are involving the local community — providing healthcare, supporting families, and improving livelihoods. Conservation must benefit people as well as wildlife.

{"title": "Samsung Electronics flags second-quarter profit jump on solid chip demand, one-off gains from Apple", "body": "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd flagged a 23% rise in second-quarter operating profit on Tuesday, beating analysts' estimates on solid chip sales to data centers catering for a work-from-home economy during the coronavirus pandemic. The sales offset weak demand for smartphones and TVs, while one-off gains from its display business, which counts Apple Inc.as a customer, also boosted profits, the company said. It gave no further details. The world's top memory chip and smartphone maker said operating profit was likely 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) in the quarter ended June, far above the 6.4 trillion won analyst forecast by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. It would be the highest quarterly profit since the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue likely fell 7% to 52 trillion won from a year earlier, Samsung added, giving only limited data in a regulatory filing ahead of its full earnings figures later this month. Work-from-home orders and growth in online learning are underpinning chip demand amid the Covid-19 pandemic and pushing up DRAM memory chip prices. U.S. DRAM supplier Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) forecast strong quarterly revenue last month. \"Chip demand was stronger than expected due to the Covid-19,\" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. Analysts said the one-off display boost reflected a payment from Apple, with the U.S. smartphone maker struggling to meet agreed shipment targets as iPhone sales take a hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. The payment was estimated at 1 trillion won, bigger than a similar 800 billion won payment a year ago, they said. The handset and TV business may have also fared better than expected due to lower marketing costs and as stores and factories resumed operations worldwide as countries lifted lockdowns, analysts said. \"The damage from the pandemic was less severe than the market had expected,\" said CW Chung, Nomura head of research in Korea. Analysts, however, warned that increases in memory chip prices may not continue in the second half of the year as data centre customers are likely to be conservative in stockpiling chips given the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the United States and other countries While prices jumped 14% on average in the quarter, they were flat in June versus May, data from DRAMeXchange showed. Shares of Samsung Electronics fell 1.8%, versus a 0.4% fall in the wider market .KS11 as of 0206 GMT. The South Korean tech giant's resilient earnings despite the pandemic came even as its leader Jay Y. Lee faces fresh legal troubles. State prosecutors are investigating Lee on suspicions of resorting to accounting fraud and stock price manipulation to win control of Samsung Group, Korea's largest conglomerate.

{"title": "JPMorgan braces for loan losses as trading props up profit", "body": "JPMorgan Chase & Co beat Wall Street estimates for profits in the second quarter due to a surge in trading revenue while setting aside a record $10.5 billion to cover future defaults, as the United States slides into one of the worst recessions in decades. The biggest US lender's loan loss provisions reflect the damage wreaked by the coronavirus pandemic, but its performance in markets bode well for trading powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both of which report later this week. The bank suspended share buybacks at least to the end of the third quarter but Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said its reserves were substantial and that it could endure more losses and still be able to pay investors a dividend. \"We can easily get through very, very tough times and never cut the dividend,\" Dimon told a call with analysts. Shares in JPMorgan rose about 2 percent as both profit and revenue beat consensus estimates, but the reserve build of $8.9 billion painted a grim picture for future quarters. Dimon warned this was not a normal recession and that the tell-tale signs of a downturn may only be visible early next year. \"The consumer's incomes are up, savings are up and home prices are up. The recessionary part will come later,\" he said. The provisions were a record for the bank, and came as Citigroup and Wells Fargo also set aside the biggest amounts since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, in part the result of changes that require banks to take provisions now if a borrower may default at any point during the agreement. JPMorgan now expects double-digit unemployment in the United States through the first half of 2021, but it warned that it may not have much visibility on the damage it is dealing with. \"Compared to the first quarter, our reserve build now assumes a more protracted downturn ... as we prepare and reserve for something worse than our base case,\" Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak told a media call. The bank's traders, often operating from home, had a huge quarter, with revenue up 77 percent as financial market dealing volumes hit record-breaking levels. Bond trading alone generated $7.3 billion in revenue as central banks bought billions worth of government paper under the huge stimulus programs to deal with the pandemic. While executives had indicated that Wall Street trading desks would set records in the quarter, the jump was well beyond expectations. \"At first blush, our take is positive,\" said UBS AG analyst Saul Martinez. \"Capital levels improved...reserve builds appear conservative and full year guidance for net interest income and expenses were generally maintained.\" Overall, the bank's net income did fall, to $4.69 billion, or $1.38 per share, beating analysts' lowered estimates of $1.04 per share. Revenue rose 15 percent to $33.8 billion, also beating estimates. Net interest margin fell to 1.99 percent from 2.37 percent in the first quarter. Trading revenue surged to $11.3 billion. \"It's clear that JPM can be viewed as prepared for all environments and that capital can build quickly given the strength of their franchises,\" brokerage Everclear said in a note. \"We'd view these results as a good read-through for the other capital markets-centric banks, particularly Goldman.\"", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/global-economy/jpmorgan-braces-loan-losses-trading-props-profit-106285", "date": "2020-07-14T22:00:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 14 July, 2020, 10:00 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 10:00 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 536, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:05.870699"}

{"title": "Over one in five videos shown to new YouTube users are 'AI slop': Researchers", "body": "A growing share of content recommended to new YouTube users consists of what researchers describe as \"AI slop,\" according to a recent study examining the platform's recommendation systems. The study found that more than 20% of videos suggested to first-time users were low-quality, AI-generated clips designed primarily to attract views. Researchers estimate the fast-expanding sector generates about $117 million in annual revenue across major social media platforms, says the Guardian. The analysis identified 278 of the world's most popular YouTube channels as being entirely composed of this type of content. Together, those channels have accumulated more than 63 billion views and 221 million subscribers. Researchers said the channels have large audiences across multiple regions, including Spain, Egypt, the United States and Brazil. Many of the videos appear to target children through bright animations, while others rely on surreal or plotless scenes featuring anthropomorphic animals or superheroes. Some creators were found to use artificial intelligence to produce what the study described as \"uncanny\" depictions of natural disasters, including large-scale flooding, often paired with calming background music. The researchers said such videos are designed to maximize watch time and advertising revenue. The study noted that much of the industry is driven by creators based in middle-income countries such as India, Nigeria and Kenya, where earnings from YouTube can exceed local median wages. YouTube has said its recommendation systems aim to connect users with high-quality content, regardless of whether it is created by humans or generated using AI tools. Critics, however, argue that large platforms operate as \"A/B testing machines,\" prioritizing content that performs well with algorithms rather than rewarding originality or craftsmanship. The researchers compared the phenomenon to \"digital junk food,\" describing it as mass-produced content created using inexpensive, automated methods to trigger algorithmic engagement while offering limited artistic value.

{"title": "World food price index rises in June, first increase in 2020: UN", "body": "World food prices rose in June to post their first increase of 2020 and mark a slight rebound after the sharp falls triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 93.2 points last month, up 2.4% on May. FAO said it had rebased here all its indices, shifting the base period to 2014-16 from a previous 2002-04. \"As trade patterns evolve, it is imperative to update the base period to ensure that the weighted basket remains relevant,\" it said. Amid continued market uncertainty, the prices of vegetable oils, sugar and dairy products rebounded to multi-month highs following sharp declines in May, while in the cereals and meat indices, most prices remained under downward pressure. The vegetable oil price index jumped 11.3% in June, reversing four consecutive months of falls. The rebound mainly reflected higher palm oil values, which were lifted by recovering global import demand and worries over possible production problems amid prolonged migrant labour shortages tied to the coronavirus outbreak. The sugar index rose 10.6% month-on-month, partly shunted higher by reports of bottlenecks in Brazilian ports due to the measures introduced to contain the spread of the virus, FAO said. The dairy index climbed 4.0% but all its components remained below where they had been before the pandemic swept the world. The cereal price index slipped 0.6% from May, with downward pressure on wheat prices intensifying last month, due partly to improved production prospects in a number of major exporting countries, especially in the Black Sea region. By contrast maize prices were firmer in June, supported by some recovery in demand and adverse growing conditions in the United States, FAO said. The meat price index also slipped 0.6% on the month, with quotations for poultry and bovine meats easing because of increased export availabilities in major producing regions. FAO also revised up its forecast for the 2020 cereal season by some 9.3 million tonnes, foreseeing global output of almost 2.790 billion tonnes — a 3.0% increase on 2019's record harvest. The bulk of the monthly increase reflected an upward revision to Australia's wheat production estimates. The forecast for world cereal utilisation in 2020/21 hit 2.735 billion tonnes, just over 43 million tonnes above the 2019/20 level. FAO's latest forecast for world trade in cereals in 2020/21 stands at 435.0 million tonnes, up 2.1% from 2019/20 levels and representing a new record high. FAO's estimate for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2021 rose by 2 million tonnes from the previous month to 929 million tonnes — a 6.0% increase year-on-year. food / worldwide / Price", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/global-economy/world-food-price-index-rises-june-first-increase-2020-un-100969", "date": "2020-07-02T15:10:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 02 July, 2020, 03:10 pm Last modified: 02 July, 2020, 05:01 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 459, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:12.576639"}
{"title": "Fouzul dismisses LPG supply shortage, blames market manipulation for price hike", "body": "Power and Energy Adviser Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan has ruled out any supply shortage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), saying recent disruptions in cylinder availability were driven by market manipulation rather than problems with imports or production. Speaking after a meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase at the Secretariat today (6 January), Fouzul said the LPG market in Bangladesh was overwhelmingly controlled by private operators. \"About 98% of the LPG business in Bangladesh is controlled by the private sector. Government involvement is limited to around 2%, where propane and butane are imported and bottled,\" he said, reports BSS. The adviser said the recent abnormal price hike and reports of temporary scarcity were the result of \"collusion and deliberate manoeuvring\" by wholesalers and retailers. He alleged that some operators had withheld supplies in anticipation of higher prices after Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission's (BERC) latest adjustment, adding that LPG prices had risen by more than Tk50 per cylinder in recent weeks, which encouraged certain market players to take advantage of the situation. He also rejected claims that the situation stemmed from any failure in supply. \"From the import side, there is no reason for a crisis,\" Fouzul said, adding that LPG imports had increased compared to the previous month. He said the government was closely monitoring the situation and would take all necessary measures to prevent further manipulation of the LPG market. He also noted that regulatory authority over LPG pricing lies primarily with BERC. Fouzul further said a series of meetings had already taken place, involving the energy secretary and the BERC chairman, followed by discussions between the energy secretary and the LPG Operators Association of Bangladesh. To address the issue, the government has launched enforcement drives across the country. Mobile courts have been deployed at district level to prevent hoarding, forced shop closures and artificial supply disruptions. Fouzul said the cabinet secretary had instructed district administrations to take firm action. The matter was also discussed at the most recent law and order committee meeting, with the participation of police and other law enforcement agencies. Monitoring teams from the Energy Division have been sent to Chattogram, the main hub for LPG imports and bottling, while inspections are also under way in Dhaka and other parts of the country. \"We believe this was a temporary situation and expect prices and supply to gradually normalise,\" he said. Fouzul also referred to potential challenges in global shipping, noting that sanctions on certain vessels had created complications in international transport. However, he said these issues had not affected LPG supplies in the current month. \"There is no immediate impact, but we are closely monitoring future risks,\" he said. energy adviser / LPG price / traders", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/traders-behind-lpg-price-manipulation-energy-adviser-1327491", "date": "2026-01-06T14:10:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 06 January, 2026, 02:10 pm Last modified: 06 January, 2026, 09:55 pm", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 453, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:14.906150"}
{"title": "Oil prices drop on demand recovery fears, OPEC+ easing expectations", "body": "Oil prices fell more than 2% on Tuesday on worries that new clampdowns on businesses to stem surging US coronavirus cases could threaten fuel demand recovery and expectations that OPEC+ might ease output cuts from August in an upcoming meeting. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures slid 96 cents, or 2.39%, to $39.14 a barrel by 0443 GMT, while Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 88 cents, or 2.06% to $41.84. Both benchmark contracts lost just over 1% on Monday. California's governor on Monday ordered bars to shut and restaurants, movie theatres, zoos and museums to cease indoor operations as coronavirus cases and hospitalizations soared. The most populous state's two largest school districts, in Los Angeles and San Diego, also said they would teach only online when classes resume in August. California's moves follow the recent reinstatement of some restrictions in other states, such as Florida and Texas. \"With the California soft lockdown now framing the picture, July could be an even more challenging month for oil than expected with even more demand woes emanating from coronavirus-linked uncertainty,\" AxiCorp market strategist Stephen Innes said in a note. The market will be watching the next move from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, whose Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee will meet on Wednesday to recommend the next level of cuts. Under the existing agreement, OPEC+ is set to taper its record supply cut of 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 7.7 million bpd from August through December. The oil market is getting closer to balance as demand gradually rises, OPEC's secretary general said on Monday. Citi analysts said implementing a 2 million bpd increase in output from August could weigh on the market given demand uncertainties, adding to risks from a potential for increased Libyan output, a return of 20% to 30% of curbed North American production, and an end to China's crude buying spree. China's June crude oil imports hit records on both monthly and daily bases, data showed on Tuesday. The market will also be closely watching data on fuel consumption due later on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute industry group and on Wednesday from the US Energy Information Administration. [API/S] [EIA/S] Analysts estimate US gasoline stockpiles fell by 900,000 barrels and crude oil inventories by 2.3 million barrels in the week to July 10, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.

{"title": "Khulna jute mill workers face uncertain future", "body": "At around noon on Sunday, in front of the Platinum Jute Mill in Khulna, eight to ten jute mill workers, who worked in the mill only five days ago, were sitting at the mill gate in despair, losing their jobs, and eagerly waiting to know whether they will get their jobs back when the mill reopens. On Thursday, a circular from the Ministry of Textiles and Jute announced the closure of 25 state-owned jute mills, including nine in the BJMC-controlled Khulna region. At the same time, the workers were relieved to hear about a golden handshake. Following the closure, there were no workers in the state-owned jute mills in the Khalishpur industrial area of ​​Khulna. The familiar noise of the mills has stopped. Workers with the pain of losing their jobs in their eyes, are living in anxiety. Newly retired workers are waiting to receive their dues. Retired worker Jalal Mia said he had joined Platinum Jute Mill in 1982 as a replacement worker (temporary worker) and became permanent in 2010. \"The wage commission has announced that gratuities and provident funds will be paid soon. That is all I want now,\" he said. His co-worker Abdul Karim, who hails from Barisal, said he was anxious about getting the arrears pay. Another retired worker, Alamgir Hossain, who has been working as a permanent worker for 18 years, said though the government says the mill would be reopened, he is not sure if he will get the job again. \"We have doubts about getting the money because those who retired in 2013-14 have not received their dues yet,\" he added. The temporary workers said that they have suffered a lot due to the closure of the mill as they will not get any benefit. Their children's education will be stopped. \"We are helpless now,\" said Abdul Hamid Sardar, convener of the CBA-Non-CBA Sangram Parishad to protect statehood jute mills, adding that in this situation, \"we demand payment of dues of temporary workers and the reopening of the mills again.\" Banij Uddin Mia, Khulna regional coordinator of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), said as per government directives, production has been stopped and the jobs of the jute mills workers have been terminated from July 1. The mills will remain closed until further notice. He said the retired permanent workers of seven mills in Khulna region will get all government benefits. However, temporary workers and daily wage workers of Khalishpur and Daulatpur Jute Mills will not get any government benefits. Jute mill workers will be paid fair dues: Khulna City Corporation mayor Talukder Abdul Khaleq said the dues of workers of seven state-owned jute mills in Khulna would be paid as per government directives. The government has allocated Tk5,000 crore to pay the debt. The mills will continue to operate through government and private-public partnerships. All these jute mills will be made production-oriented by modernisation under PPP. The mills will be run by skilled workers. The workers' gratuity and the provident fund will be paid according to employment rules, he added. On June 25, the government decided to close 25 state-owned jute mills, including nine in the Khulna region. This prompted workers to hold protests over the closure of the mills. The CBA-Non-CBA Sangram Parishad announced a two-day ultimatum through a press conference on June 26. The workers' movement started with sit-ins, demonstrations and rallies. Children of working families also took part in this movement. The atmosphere in Khulna's industrial area became heavy with the slogans of the workers. However, on June 30, the workers' leaders suspended the programme as no notice to close the mills was forthcoming. Meanwhile, additional police were deployed at Khalishpur People's Gol Chattor, Daulatpur Jute Mill Gate, Atra Eastern Mill Gate and Nawapara Industrial Area. Notice of job termination of workers under a Golden Handshake including the closure of jute mills was put on the notice boards of Platinum, Crescent, Khalishpur, Daulatpur, Star, Eastern, Carpeting and JJI Jute Mills one by one on Thursday night.

He made the remarks while responding to reporters' questions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. Asked what would happen to the interim government's commitments if the next government decides not to proceed with the agreements, Khalilur said the issue was \"speculative\". Khalilur also parried questions regarding reported criticism of his recent appointment as a director of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, reports UNB. When pressed by a TV journalist about becoming a Biman director while holding the post of NSA, he briefly smiled and said, \"There is no Biman anywhere in the world.\" Khalilur, who also serves as the High Representative on the Rohingya Issue, earlier held a meeting with Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

{"title": "'ICE Out' strike and nationwide protests planned across US", "body": "A wave of strikes and mass demonstrations against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is set to sweep across the United States on 30 and 31 January, as grassroots organisers mobilise against immigration enforcement practices and alleged abuses in communities nationwide. According to a report by The Guardian, the two-day action follows the deaths of at least eight people linked to ICE operations since the beginning of the year, including the widely publicised killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Activists are demanding the permanent removal of ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from towns and cities across the country. The first phase of the action, scheduled for Friday, has been framed as a \"national shutdown\" by organisers led by student groups at the University of Minnesota. The call urges people to halt work, education, and consumer activity under the slogan: \"No work. No school. No shopping. Stop funding ICE.\" The move, described online as a \"blackout\" or \"general strike\", is intended to disrupt economic activity in protest of federal immigration enforcement. On Saturday, a broader mobilisation titled the \"ICE Out of Everywhere National Day of Action\" will take place, coordinated by the national grassroots organisation 50501. The protests are expected to include rallies, demonstrations, and vigils across all 50 states and Washington DC. Organisers say the actions are aimed at seeking justice for individuals detained by ICE and those who have died during enforcement operations or while in custody. Among the cases cited are the death of 55-year-old Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos at an ICE facility in El Paso, Texas, on 3 January; the detention of five-year-old Liam Ramos in Minnesota while returning home from school; and the fatal shooting of 43-year-old Keith Porter Jr in Los Angeles on New Year's Eve. Public anger has intensified following video footage of the killings of Good and Pretti in Minneapolis earlier this month. Recent polling by YouGov indicates growing opposition to ICE, with more Americans now supporting abolition than opposing it. \"We are responding to people's outrage. We've seen the Overton window shifting,\" said Gloriann Sahay, a national coordinator with 50501. \"We're seeing people from typically non-political spectrums get involved in this conversation and say: 'This doesn't feel like America.'\" The planned protests build on last weekend's mass mobilisation in Minneapolis, where hundreds of businesses closed, and thousands joined a general strike on 23 January to oppose a surge in local immigration enforcement. The campaign has also gained momentum online, with widespread social media engagement and endorsements from public figures. Singer Ariana Grande shared an infographic about the strike on Instagram, while actor Pedro Pascal posted drawings of Good and Pretti with the caption: \"Pretti Good reason for a national strike.\" On Friday, student-led walkouts are expected across Minnesota, organised by groups including the Somali Student Association, Black Student Union and Graduate Labor Union at the University of Minnesota. Calling on students nationwide to join, the groups stated online: \"Students are always at the heart of movements for justice across the world. We demand ICE out for good!\" Los Angeles, California. REUTERS/Jill Connelly Saturday's demonstrations will expand to ICE detention centres, field offices, and airports, targeting airlines accused of transporting ICE detainees, including Global Crossing Airlines and World Atlantic Airlines. Protests are also planned outside the offices of members of Congress who support ICE. Organisers have further signalled plans to challenge Democratic lawmakers who have voted to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or to expand ICE's authority. They say they are tracking immigration-related votes and intend to back primary challengers against what they describe as \"pro-ICE\" incumbents. Calls are also growing for Congress to block DHS funding until ICE is dismantled and to pass legislation ending federal cooperation with local law enforcement agencies. Earlier this week, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to accept restrictions on ICE operations, including mandatory body cameras and a ban on face coverings, before approving DHS funding to avert a partial government shutdown. In Florida, activists plan to continue vigils and protests at immigration detention facilities, including the Alligator Alcatraz centre in south Florida, and at the Sarasota school board, following the adoption of a resolution supporting cooperation with ICE. \"Rapid response is not new to Florida,\" said Sarah Parker, a Tampa-based national coordinator with 50501. \"We have the infrastructure, we have the will, and we are not giving up.\" Beyond street protests, 50501 has launched pressure campaigns targeting what it calls the support systems behind immigration enforcement. One initiative, \"No Housing for ICE\", urges hotels to stop accommodating ICE, CBP and DHS agents, encouraging demonstrations, boycotts and online campaigns against participating businesses. Another campaign, \"#DontServeICE\", aims to persuade local businesses to refuse service to ICE agents through consumer boycotts and public pressure. Organisers are also urging chambers of commerce and business associations to adopt non-cooperation pledges.

Infrastructure heavyweights Ferrovial, Sacyr, FCC and Acciona have each paired up with local companies to bid for the project called \"Espai Barca\", or \"Barca Space\", the sources said. One source in the construction sector said the project was worth approximately 300 million euros (269.7 million pounds). The four companies and F.C. Barcelona declined to comment. The 26-times Spanish league champions have been looking to renovate Camp Nou for around two decades, with president Josep-Maria Bartomeu forging ahead now despite the club's weak finances and the COVID-19 pandemic. The four competitors presented their plans on Friday, with final submissions expected this autumn and a decision on the winning bidder due by the end of the year, a second source said, adding the works should begin in May 2021. Heathrow owner Ferrovial has joined forces with Catalan builders Rubau and Copisa, while Sacyr has teamed up with Beksiks and Acsa (currently known as Sorigue). FCC is working with Comsa, while renewables specialist Acciona has allied with Copcisa, a third source said. The winning bidder will have four years to complete the renovation, the same source added. Works will include increasing the stadium's capacity to just over 105,000 spectators, compared with just over 99,000 currently, as well as installing a roof and revamping the surrounding neighbourhood, the first source said.

{"title": "First ever car with integrated Gemini assistant is here", "body": "Volvo has lifted the curtain on the EX60, a mid-sized electric SUV that looks designed to steady the company's electric ambitions after a difficult run. On paper, it is the most convincing EV Volvo has announced in years, blending long range, serious performance and a deep integration of Google's Gemini AI. Besides impressive specifications, the most important shift sits inside the cabin. The EX60 becomes Volvo's first car with Gemini built directly into its Android Automotive system. Unlike older voice assistants, Gemini is designed for natural, multi-step conversation. Drivers can search emails for addresses, plan trips, check whether luggage will fit in the boot, or manage bookings using linked Google services. Volvo says future updates will allow Gemini to draw on the car's cameras, letting it answer questions about what lies ahead on the road. This intelligence runs on what Volvo calls HuginCore, a new software-defined architecture powered by Qualcomm cockpit hardware and Nvidia's Drive AGX Orin for safety systems. The result, Volvo claims, is faster maps, near-instant responses and smoother infotainment on a curved 15-inch OLED display. Underneath, the EX60 sits on Volvo's new SPA3 platform, using gigacasting to reduce weight and cut its carbon footprint. It will also be offered in rugged Cross Country form with raised suspension.

{"title": "Thousands flee fearing Myanmar military operation", "body": "Thousands of people in western Myanmar have been fleeing their villages over the past week after an evacuation order from officials due to clashes between the government and ethnic rebels. The Rakhine state government, in an order last Tuesday, instructed village administrators in Rathedaung township to tell residents to stay away from their homes due to military plans to conduct a \"clearance operation\" against the rebels. \"Clearance operation\" is Myanmar military parlance for counterinsurgency action. \"Since the day the order was issued, more than 10,000 people from the operation area fled their villages,\" Khin Maung Latt, an upper house member of parliament for Rathedaung township, said Monday, reports Associated Press on Tuesday. The government has been embroiled for more than a year in an intermittent conflict with the Arakan Army, a well-trained and well-armed guerrilla force representing members of the area's Rakhine ethnic group. In Rakhine in 2017, the military carried out counterinsurgency operations against insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority, but critics charge they employed a campaign of terror to drive the Rohingya out of the country. An estimated 740,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, where they remain in refugee camps. The Rakhine are Buddhist, the religion of almost 90 percent of Myanmar's people. \"We have to flee the village as we don't want to face the soldiers from the military. They were shooting into the village, arresting the villagers to use as human shields,\" said Aye Mg, a 58-year-old resident of Rathedaung township's Kyauktan village, where the government previously detained dozens of suspected Rakhine militants. Civil society organisations and Buddhist monks are helping the newly displaced villagers find shelter. \"People can't live in their places any longer due to the fighting. We are hosting over 300 displaced people at our monastery; around 100 of them have arrived recently,\" Okkahta, a monk, said from the Tahtipati Sipintharyar Monastery in Rathedaung town. \"It's like doomsday for them,\" lawmaker Khin Maung Lat said, explaining why villagers fled. \"They are in fear. This is the impact of the evacuation order to stay away from the village during the military operation.\" \"Even most of the village administrators are fleeing from the villages,\" he said. \"Even they are scared to go back to their villages.\" Rakhine State / Rohingya Crisis / Myanmar / Myanmar Army Clearing Operation", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/south-asia-china/thousands-flee-fearing-myanmar-military-operation-100165", "date": "2020-06-30T21:55:00+06:00", "author": "AP/UNB 30 June, 2020, 09:55 pm Last modified: 30 June, 2020, 09:59 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 383, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:36.151318"}

{"title": "What’s holding back toys from becoming Bangladesh’s next big export?", "body": "Toys worldwide have undergone constant experimentation and evolution, and Bangladesh is no exception. Bangladesh's toy industry largely serves domestic demand as an import-substitute sector valued at approximately Tk7,000 crore, with Tk4,000 crore supplied locally and the rest imported. Yet the global toy export market was $102.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $150 billion by 2032. Against this backdrop, Bangladesh's toy exports stood at only $54.43 million in FY2024–25 — less than 0.2% of the global market, even when including exports from industries located in Export Processing Zones (EPZs). The toy industry is highly labor-intensive and aligns well with Bangladesh's economic structure. It has strong potential both as an export diversification sector and as an import-substitute industry capable of saving foreign exchange. China remains the global leader, exporting nearly $40 billion worth of toys annually. However, rising labor costs in China create an opportunity for Bangladesh to expand its footprint, supported by growing domestic demand and increasing global consumption driven by higher disposable incomes and rising demand for sustainable and educational toys. Bangladesh can leverage its competitive advantages—skilled and low-cost labor, similar to the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector—while creating new opportunities for women's economic participation. Additionally, geopolitical shifts, including US–China trade tensions, have encouraged supply chain diversification, opening doors for new entrants. If Bangladesh addresses key structural challenges, it could attract substantial investment and boost exports. Over 100 toy manufacturers currently operate in Bangladesh, including around 12 large firms with strong export prospects. A few companies export regularly, and their growth trajectories are promising. Several industries in Economic Zones are exporting to developed markets such as the EU, Japan, and the US, generating employment and fostering technological development. However, meaningful technology transfer from EPZs to the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) has yet to take place. Bangladesh exports toys to 47 countries, including Australia, the EU, the US, Japan, India, and Vietnam. However, domestic producers rely heavily on imported raw materials. Without bonded warehouse facilities, non-bonded manufacturers struggle to remain competitive. Essential tools such as die punches, molds, and wood components (batal) are also mostly imported from China. The Tool Institute of BITAC has recently begun producing various types of dies; however, its capacity remains too limited to meet demand. One leading manufacturer, which began operations in 2008 with only Tk90,000 producing simple \"jhunjhunis,\" now produces a wide range of toys—cars, motorcycles, airplanes, toy pistols, fishing games, and guitars—and employs around 2,000 workers. The main raw material is PP granules, purchased from local suppliers or imported from China. With the expansion of production, imports of key components such as gearboxes, circuits, motors, and screws have also increased. Manufacturers claim that locally produced toys maintain higher quality standards than many imported Chinese toys due to better-quality plastics and materials. However, molds and molding machines imported from China increase production costs. Skilled technical support is needed to improve mold finishing. Despite numerous challenges, toy manufacturers are expanding into new export markets, including Italy, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia. Exporting firms report using nearly 500 molds and more than 56 molding machines, most of which are imported. Investment in this sector is growing, driven by domestic demand and the labor-intensive nature of production. The industry is environmentally friendly, with many products and components being recyclable. DOE certification and renewal processes are manageable, and the sector requires minimal gas consumption. Labor availability is strong, and many roles allow women to work from home. However, the need for training and professional development remains substantial. Bangladesh exports toys to 47 countries, including Australia, the EU, the US, Japan, India, and Vietnam. However, domestic producers rely significantly on imported raw materials. Without bonded warehouse facilities, non-bonded manufacturers struggle to remain competitive. Essential tools such as die punches, molds, and wood components (batal) are also mostly imported from China. Bangladesh exports toys to 47 countries, including Australia, the EU, the US, Japan, India, and Vietnam. However, domestic producers rely significantly on imported raw materials. Without bonded warehouse facilities, non-bonded manufacturers struggle to remain competitive. Essential tools such as die punches, molds, and wood components (batal) are also mostly imported from China. Most domestic manufacturers produce non-branded toys and lack established brands. HS code issues related to components complicate imports. Constraints include shortages of skilled and trained manpower, even though less-skilled labor is available; inadequate laboratory facilities; and difficulties in obtaining design approvals, which create challenges for manufacturers. Chemical inputs are fully imported, and CAD/CAM training remains insufficient. Frequent technological changes hinder customization due to limited R&D and institutional support. Weak enforcement of intellectual property rights leads to frequent design copying, harming genuine producers. Compliance with international standards is a major challenge. Export markets such as the EU, US, and Japan require certifications including CE/EN71, CPSIA, and others. Limited local testing capacity forces firms to rely on foreign laboratories, increasing costs and lead times. For example, Intertek can provide physical and mechanical testing, but chemical migration tests (EN 71-3) must be conducted abroad. Different countries have varying mandatory testing requirements (e.g., Brazil's Inmetro based on Mercosur NM 300:2002, ASTM F963 in the US), further raising the compliance burden. The sector also needs affordable working capital, matching grants for product development, and support to diversify into high-tech or STEAM-based toys. Traditional toys, such as dolls and teddy bears, face competition from digital games, reducing demand. Furthermore, GSP benefits in the EU and Japan will diminish after LDC graduation, and the US GSP program has remained suspended since 2013 due to labor rights concerns. Additional challenges include inadequate warehousing, high costs due to the inability to import raw materials in bulk, limited presence of international toy buyers in Bangladesh, and heavy taxation on key inputs. For example, printed paper or paperboard labels of all kinds (stickers, HS 4821) face a total tax incidence of more than 89%; sound signaling equipment is taxed at 37.25%, and electrical conductors can be taxed up to 90%. The high tax burden on intermediate raw materials increases production costs. A detailed analysis of tax policies for the sector is needed if it is to realize its export potential. Manufacturers argue that taxes on intermediate raw materials should not exceed 10% and that VAT-compliant industries should receive tax rebates. They also advocate for the extension of bonded warehouse facilities. The global toy industry presents major growth opportunities. Soft/plush toys had global exports of $11.76 billion in 2023 and have strong links with the RMG sector. Since Bangladesh has a solid footing in RMG, this segment of toys offers significant potential for exploration. Wooden toys accounted for $27.47 billion in exports in 2023 and are projected to reach $40.64 billion by 2031, while STEAM toys are expected to exceed $10 billion by 2030. The toy sector is also undergoing various transitions, and supporting institutions should provide the necessary assistance to industrial entrepreneurs. Given the significant potential across plastic, metal, wooden, and AI-enabled toys, Bangladesh urgently needs a Comprehensive National Toy Policy. This policy should include bonded warehouse facilities similar to those in the RMG sector, grant associations the authority to issue Utilisation Declarations (UD), and harmonize export entitlements across sectors. Testing laboratories must be strengthened, and tool-and-die facilities expanded. A dedicated Tool and Technology Institute—modeled on BITAC—should be established in every division to support mold and die manufacturing across the country. Enhanced collaboration between Economic Zones and non-EZ areas is essential for effective technology transfer. Trained manpower developed in the export processing zones could serve as a source of knowledge transfer. Finally, toy clusters should be established to expand Bangladesh's toy and games market to at least $1 billion by 2030. The sector has already demonstrated its resilience in meeting domestic demand and serving the export market. With the right policy and institutional support, adequate testing infrastructure and laboratory facilities, and proper financing, the sector can advance toward export diversification.

{"title": "India's tech hub, other towns back in lockdown as coronavirus infections surge", "body": "India's high-tech hub of Bengaluru will go back into a coronavirus lockdown for a week on Tuesday after a surge of infections, threatening to derail government efforts to revive a stuttering economy. Places of worship, public transport, government offices and most shops will shut down again from the evening, and people will be confined to their homes, only allowed out for essential needs. Schools, colleges and restaurants will stay shut, authorities said. Bengaluru, home to some of the world's biggest IT companies, such as Infosys, had only about 1,000 novel coronavirus cases in mid-June and was seen to have done better than other parts of the India in terms of testing and contact tracing. But the number has grown to nearly 20,000 as of Monday, which health experts blamed on the lifting of restrictions in June, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, worried about the economy, ended a nationwide lockdown that had thrown millions out of work. Bengaluru began seeing a surge in infections from late June as both testing and people's movements picked up, Hephsiba Korlapati, a senior official in the city's Covid-19 response team, told Reuters. In all, India has 906,752 cases of the novel coronavirus with 28,498 new infections reported on Tuesday, according to data from the federal health ministry, the third highest total in the world behind Brazil and the United States. While cases in the main cities of Mumbai and Delhi account for most of the tally, infections are picking up in smaller cities, forcing authorities to re-impose curbs. The western city of Pune, which is also an industrial and tech hub, began a 10-day shutdown on Monday while cities as far flung as Shillong in the remote northeast to Srinagar, the main city of Kashmir in the north, imposed new curbs on movements to contain the virus. The curbs raised questions about prospects for India's growth, Japan's biggest brokerage and investment bank, Nomura, said in a note. \"We also find growing evidence that after the initial normalisation in activity, mobility trends have started to plateau and fall lately,\" Nomura said. \"This implies that growth could remain below pre-pandemic peaks for a prolonged period of time,\" they said.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/south-asia-china/indias-tech-hub-other-towns-back-lockdown-coronavirus-infections-surge-106108", "date": "2020-07-14T16:00:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 14 July, 2020, 04:00 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 04:03 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 363, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:42.458895"}

{"title": "WHO, Unicef calls for immediate effort to vaccinate children", "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, stressed the need for immediate efforts to vaccinate all children as the number of children receiving life-saving vaccines around the world has declined alarmingly. .\"Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the history of public health, and more children are now being immunized than ever before\", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General on Wednesday, reports UN. \"But the pandemic has put those gains at risk. The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunizations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself. But it doesn't have to be that way. Vaccines can be delivered safely even during the pandemic, and we are calling on countries to ensure these essential life-saving programmes continue.\" Pandemic affecting access Latest data from the sister UN agencies shows how the pandemic is jeopardizing improvements in vaccine expansion to more than 100 countries. COVID-19 has put at least 30 measles vaccination campaigns at risk of cancellation worldwide, which could lead to further outbreaks this year and beyond. A survey of 82 countries has revealed that three-quarters report disruptions in their immunization programmes related to the pandemic. Even where services are offered, people cannot access them due to reasons such as reluctance to leave home, transport interruptions, economic hardship, movement restrictions, or fear of being exposed to people who have the disease. Meanwhile, many health workers have been affected by travel restrictions, redeployment to COVID-19 response, and a lack of protective equipment. Children missing out The partners said for the first time in nearly 30 years, the world risks seeing a reduction in children receiving three doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, or whooping cough (DTP3): a marker for immunization coverage within and across countries. Prior to the crisis, DTP3 and measles vaccines coverage was already stalling at 85 per cent, and a child born today has a less than 20 per cent chance of receiving all globally recommended vaccines by their fifth birthday. Last year, nearly 14 million children missed out on these two vaccines and other life-saving inoculations. The majority live in Africa, and two-thirds are in 10 middle- and low-income countries that include Angola, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and India. Hard-won gains at risk The UN agencies further warn that the pandemic could undo progress in regions such as South Asia, where coverage for the third dose of DTP increased by 12 per cent over the past decade. The situation is especially concerning for Latin America and the Caribbean, where \"historically high\" coverage has fallen during this same period. \"COVID-19 has made previously routine vaccination a daunting challenge\", said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. \"We must prevent a further deterioration in vaccine coverage and urgently resume vaccination programs before children's lives are threatened by other diseases. We cannot trade one health crisis for another.\" Both WHO and UNICEF continue to support countries during the pandemic, including with restoring safe delivery of immunization services and providing protective equipment for health workers. Other efforts are related to rectifying coverage gaps and expanding routine services to communities that have missed out, which are home to some of the most vulnerable children.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/who-unicef-calls-immediate-effort-vaccinate-children-107002", "date": "2020-07-16T13:00:00+06:00", "author": "UNB 16 July, 2020, 01:00 pm Last modified: 16 July, 2020, 01:01 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 538, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:18:46.601386"}
{"title": "Nvidia's pitch for sovereign AI resonates with EU leaders", "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been pitching the idea of \"sovereign AI\" since 2023. Europe is now starting to listen and act. The concept is based on the idea that the language, knowledge, history and culture of each region are different, and every nation needs to develop and own its AI. Last week, the CEO of the artificial-intelligence chipmaker toured Europe's major capitals - London, Paris and Berlin - announcing a slew of projects and partnerships, while highlighting the lack of AI infrastructure in the region. In a place where leaders are increasingly wary of the continent's dependency on a handful of US tech companies and after drawing ire from the US President Donald Trump, his vision has started to gain traction. \"We are going to invest billions in here ... but Europe needs to move into AI quickly,\" Huang said on Wednesday in Paris. On Monday of last week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced 1 billion pounds ($1.35 billion) in funding to scale up computing power in a global race \"to be an AI maker and not an AI taker.\" French President Emmanuel Macron called building AI infrastructure \"our fight for sovereignty\" at VivaTech, one of the largest global tech conferences. After Nvidia laid out plans to build an AI cloud platform in Germany with Deutsche Telekom, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for the digital sovereignty and economic future of Europe's top economy. Europe lags behind both the US and China as its cloud infrastructure is mostly run by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, and it has only a few smaller AI companies such as Mistral to rival the US ones. \"There's no reason why Europe shouldn't have tech champions,\" said 31-year-old Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, sitting beside Huang, who has led Nvidia for more than three decades, at a panel at VivaTech. \"This is a gigantic dream.\" GIGAFACTORY PLANS UNLEASHED In France, Mistral has partnered with Nvidia to build a data centre to power the AI needs of European companies with a homegrown alternative. It will use 18,000 of the latest Nvidia AI chips in the first phase, with plans to expand across multiple sites in 2026. In February, the European Union announced plans to build four \"AI gigafactories\" at a cost of $20 billion to lower dependence on US firms. The European Commission has been in touch with Huang and he had told the EU executive that he was going to allocate some chip production to Europe for these factories, an EU official told Reuters. Nvidia's chips known as Graphics Processing Units or GPUs are crucial for building AI data centres from the US to Japan and India to the Middle East. In Europe, a push for sovereign AI could reshape the tech landscape with domestic cloud providers, AI startups, and chipmakers standing to gain from new government funding and a shift toward in-region data infrastructure. Nvidia also wants to cement demand for its AI chips, ensuring that even as countries seek independence, they still rely on its technology to get there. The push is not without challenges. High electricity costs and rising demand could strain sourcing of electricity for data centres. Data centres account for 3% of EU electricity demand, but their consumption is expected to increase rapidly this decade due to AI. Mistral, which has raised just over $1 billion, is trying to become a European homegrown champion with a fraction of the money US hyperscalers or large data-centre operators spend in a month. \"Hyperscalers are spending $10 billion to $15 billion per quarter in their infrastructure. Who in Europe can afford that exactly?\" said Pascal Brier, chief innovation officer at Capgemini a partner of both Nvidia and Mistral. \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything, but we have to be cognizant about the fact that there will always be a gap.\" Mistral has launched several AI models which are used by businesses but companies tend to mix them with models from other companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms. \"Most of the time it's not Mistral or the rest, it's Mistral and the rest,\" Brier said.

Md Abdur Razzak, chairman of JMI Hospital Requisite Manufacturing Ltd; Md Matiur Rahman, coordinator (medical team) of Toma Construction Ltd; and Aminul Islam Amin, chairman and managing director of Elan Corporation have been asked to be present at the ACC's Segunbagicha head office in the capital on July 8. The corruption watchdog asked Md Humayun Kabir, director of Mediteck Imaging Ltd; and Motazzerul Islam Mithu, chairman of the Dhaka International Medical College Hospital and owner of Lexican Merchandise and Technocrat Ltd to appear before the enquiry team on July 9. On June 18, the ACC formed a four-member team to enquire allegations of corruption centring the purchases of N95 masks and PPE. The probe panel is headed by ACC Director Mir Zainul Abedin Shebly, while Deputy Director Nurul Huda, and assistant directors Saiduzzaman and Ataur Rahman are the other members of the committee. The team on June 21 sent letters to the secretary of the Health Services Division, the director general of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and the director of the Central Medical Stores Depot (CMSD). In its letter to the ministry, the ACC sought information regarding purchases of facemasks, PPE, sanitisers, ICU equipment, ventilators, PCR machines, Covid-19 test kits and other health equipment since the coronavirus outbreak began in the country in March this year. The commission also sought information and documents regarding the projects, allotted money, and the organizations that implemented these projects. Information was also sought about doctors who have been transferred since March 26 this year with detailed list and their previous and present workstations and contact numbers.

{"title": "Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to UK - court rules", "body": "Senior judges in a UK court have ruled that Shamima Begum should be allowed to return to the UK to challenge the deprivation of her British citizenship. She was one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria to join the so-called Islamic State group (IS) - travelled to Syria in February 2015 and lived under IS rule for more than three years before she was found, nine months pregnant, in a Syrian refugee camp in February last year, reports The Telegraph. Then home secretary Sajid Javid revoked her British citizenship on national security grounds later that month. Begum, now 20, took legal action against the Home Office, claiming the decision was unlawful because it rendered her stateless and exposed her to a real risk of death or inhuman and degrading treatment. In February, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a specialist tribunal which hears challenges to decisions to remove someone's British citizenship on national security grounds - ruled the decision was lawful as Begum was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\" at the time of the decision. The tribunal also found that she \"cannot play any meaningful part in her appeal and that, to that extent, the appeal will not be fair and effective\", but ruled that \"it does not follow that her appeal succeeds\". Shamima Begum's challenge to the Home Office's decision to refuse to allow her to enter the UK to effectively pursue her appeal was also rejected. In June, Shamima Begum's barrister Tom Hickman QC told the Court of Appeal that removing his client's British citizenship took away \"the real possibility that she could return to the UK\". He said the decision had the result of \"exposing her to ... the real risk of removal to Bangladesh or Iraq\", where Begum faced \"extra-judicial killing at the hands of the police\" or \"a wholly unfair and predetermined 'trial' and an immediate sentence of death\". At the hearing last month, Hickman argued that Begum's appeal against the deprivation of her citizenship should be allowed because it \"cannot be pursued in a manner that satisfies even minimum requirements of fair procedure\". He also said Javid had been informed that Begum could not have a fair or effective appeal when he took the decision to revoke her citizenship. Hickman pointed out that Shamima Begum, who remains in the al-Roj camp in Syria, was only 15 when she left the UK, saying: \"She had not even taken her GCSE exams.\" Sir James Eadie QC, representing the Home Office, said: \"The fact that the appellant could not fully engage with the statutory appeal procedure was a result of her decision to leave the UK, travel to Syria against Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice and align with ISIL. \"This led to her being held in conditions akin to detention in a foreign state at the hands of a third party, the Syrian Defence Force. \"It was not the result of any action by the secretary of state and the deprivation decision did not have any causative impact on the appellant in this respect.\" Begum was one of three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green Academy who left their homes and families to join IS, shortly after Sharmeena Begum - who is no relation - travelled to Syria in December 2014. Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase, then 16 and 15 respectively, and Begum boarded a flight from Gatwick Airport to Istanbul, Turkey, on February 17 2015, before making their way to Raqqa in Syria. Shamima claims she married Dutch convert Yago Riedijk 10 days after arriving in IS territory, with all three of her school friends also reportedly marrying foreign IS fighters. She told The Times last February that she left Raqqa in January 2017 with her husband but her children, a one-year-old girl and a three-month-old boy, had both since died. Her third child died shortly after he was born.

{"title": "Pizza Hut’s biggest franchisee declares bankruptcy", "body": "The largest franchisee of Pizza Hut restaurants in the US, NPC International Inc filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday after coronavirus-related shutdowns added to a long-playing dip in popularity for the ubiquitous brand. Kansas-based NPC International said in a statement it has entered into a restructuring support agreement with its lenders to \"substantially reduce NPC's long-term debt and strengthen the company's capital structure,\" reports Forbes. The company has $903 million in debt and has pre-negotiated a restructuring agreement with about 90 percent of its first-lien lenders and 17 percent of second lien lenders, according to Bloomberg. The plan is aimed at reducing the company's debt, with first-lien lenders taking equity and potentially participating in a new cash injection. It also includes the sale of at least part of the company's restaurants, Bloomberg said. Rising commodities costs and a \"higher level of financial leverage,\" presented challenges to the restaurant operator, Jon Weber, chief executive and president of NPC's Pizza Hut division, said in the statement. NPC owns 1,225 Pizza Hut locations, 385 Wendy's restaurants, has 7,500 full-time employees, about 28,500 part-time workers, and operates in 30 states and the District of Columbia, according to the company which said he aims to keep its locations open and keep paying workers. In a statement, Pizza Hut said it hopes the restructuring will help \"NPC's Pizza Hut restaurants generate the same momentum we are seeing throughout the Pizza Hut U.S. business,\" which in May posted its highest delivery and carry-out average sales week in the past eight years. But Pizza Hut as a brand has faced challenges from the rise of competitors for years. When quarterly results for the brand's parent company, Yum Brands, were released in late April, measuring sales through March 31, worldwide system sales, excluding foreign currency translation, dipped 2% at sister brand KFC and dropped 9% at Pizza Hut, with the dips partially offset by 4% sales growth at Taco Bell. \"These challenges have been magnified recently by the impact and uncertainty of Covid-19,\" said Jon Weber, chief executive and president of NPC's Pizza Hut division. NPC International is the largest franchisee of any restaurant in the US, based on location counts. Based in Leawood, Kansas, the company has long been the backbone of Pizza Hut's franchise community. Even before the pandemic, the company sought help from restructuring advisors, according to Bloomberg. Restaurants across the country have been hit hard by closures mandated as the nation tries to curb the spread of Covid-19.

The deceased were identified as Ratan SenTanchangya (60), Bimal Kanti Chakma alias Prajit Chakma (65), David Marma (50), Joy Tripura (40), Jiten Tripura (42) and Milon Chakma (60). \"Some unknown people with arms entered the house in the morning and opened fire indiscriminately, killing six members of the PCJSS (reform) on the spot,\" said Bandarban Sadar Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Shahidul Islam Chowdhury. \"The incident will be investigated and those who were involved will be identified,\" said the OC.

{"title": "Pakistan stumble, but overcome spirited Afghanistan", "body": "Pakistan 230 for 7 (Imad 49*, Babar 45, Nabi 2-23, Mujeeb 2-34) beat Afghanistan 227 for 9 (Asghar 42, Najibullah 42, Afridi 4-47, Wahab 2-29) by three wickets There was panic, pandemonium, passion and pain in the World Cup group stage match between Afghanistan and Pakistan as Pakistan held their nerve to win by three wickets at Leeds on Saturday. Teenage left-arm quick Shaheen Shah Afridi was once again the pick of the bowlers taking four Afghanistan wickets while a composed 49 from Imad Wasim helped a nervous Pakistan chase down the total with two deliveries to spare. The win takes Pakistan to fourth spot, with nine points, a point above England and they now have a genuine chance of making the semi-finals, especially if they can win their last game as well. After winning the toss, Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib chose to bat on a slow surface and he was the first wicket to fall with the score on 27, dismissed by Afridi. The 18-year-old soon had two wickets in two balls as he dismissed Hashmatullah Shahidi for a golden duck. The hat-trick was averted by new batsman Ikram Alikhil as he and opener Rahmat Shah then formed a nice 30-run partnership before Rahmat was dismissed by Imad for 35. Asghar Afghan then came in and formed a solid counter-attacking partnership with Ikram to take the team score past 100. Just as the Afghans were looking to go on the ascendency, Shadab Khan had Asghar bowled for 42, and soon after Ikram was gone too, dismissed for 24 by Imad. At 125/5 the pendulum of the game had once again swung, but the Afghans started to rebuild again with Mohammad Nabi and Najibullah Zadran and they would take the team score past 150 before Nabi was gone for 16. Zadran then found another able partner in Samiullah Shinwari to cross the 200-run mark before he was dismissed for 42. With just over five overs left and three wickets in hand, Shinwari looked for quick runs with the tail, but the Pakistani fast bowlers, especially Afridi and Wahab Riaz bowled beautifully to keep the total down to 227/9. Afghanistan got immediate success as Mujeeb Ur Rahman had Fakhar Zaman trapped in front for a duck. From there, two of Pakistan’s best batsmen Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam formed a partnership and took the total to 72 before Imam had a rush of blood, charged down the track to slog Nabi, and was eventually stumped for 36. Last match’s centurion, Babar was playing fluently but a brilliant delivery from Nabi had him bowled around the legs for 45 and Afghanistan were once again back in the game. Experienced Mohammad Hafeez and in-form Haris Sohail then formed a partnership to take the score past 100 but Hafeez soon gave his wicket away, as he has done so far in this tournament for 19. Haris and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed were both soon dismissed for 27 and 18 respectively and Afghanistan could sense a famous victory with Pakistan 156/6 after 39 overs. But from there, Imad Wasim formed a vital stand with Shadab to reduce the required run rate from around seven to around six and take the team past 200. Shadab was eventually run-out for 11 but Imad and Wahab Riaz ensured there were no further hiccups and the win was secured. Afghanistan can feel hard done by this as they could have fielded better and Imad would have been out much earlier. The injury to fast bowler Hamid Hassan, who was probably playing his last international match, after bowling two overs only gave Gulbadin no choice but to bowl the last over, and he was expensive today, going at 7.55 runs per over. And then there was the umpiring in this game which was once again under the scanner as Haris Sohail survived an LBW appeal which was given not-out and Afghanistan had run out of reviews; replays showed that it would have been out. The win takes Pakistan into fourth spot from sixth and over Bangladesh who are on seven points at sixth and England who are on eight points at fifth. Afghanistan stay winless, with just one game left to play and are eliminated along with Windies (9th with three points) South Africa (8th with five points). Sri Lanka are on seventh spot with a very slim hope of qualification to the semis with six points.

{"title": "Police must break free from oppression: IGP", "body": "To win people's hearts, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Benazir Ahmed has urged the force to break free from oppression and utilise police's legal capacity. \"If you want to be people's police, you have to love them first. You have to reach them and sincerely work for them,\" he told a workshop at the police headquarters on Thursday. The Bangladesh Police has helped the government ensure social distancing and enforce shutdown since the coronavirus outbreak made inroads in March. During the pandemic-led countrywide shutdown, police distributed relief materials and reached people at their homes with essentials in many places. Referring to those welfare activities, IGP Benazir Ahmed said, \"We stood by the people from the day one of the coronavirus outbreak, braving the risk of infection. Benazir said police jumped to fight coronavirus without waiting to receive personal protective equipment. Therefore, the infection rate among the frontline Covid-19 fighters was high at the beginning. Till date, 44 policemen from different ranks died from the virus infection in the line of duty. \"The way police reached the people, stood by them and protected them during the pandemic is undoubtedly a commendable job. Not only in Bangladesh, but people from different parts of the world are also praising the force through social media,\" said the IGP. In just three months, police won the people's hearts, he said, adding, \"The Liberation War gave police a chance to serve the country. Fifty years later, the virus crisis has brought about the second chance to reach the people.\" \"What will happen when the pandemic is over? Would we go back to where we had been before the pandemic? No, we will not fall back. Rather, we will go forward,\" he said. The IGP said none can buy love, compassion and respect from people; rather it has to be earned. Reiterating his stance against corruption and drugs, Benazir Ahmed said police must shake off all sorts of misdeeds. The Innovation and Good Practice wing of the Police Headquarters organised the workshop which ended Thursday. The entire force was divided into five clusters and from those 500-field-level policemen, ranging from constable to inspector, gave their opinions on good practices, career, corruption and welfare. There were around 25 questioners in the data collection sheet, which would be analysed by the respective section officials. The initiative to take suggestions from the field officials aimed at making police more public-friendly, modern, and time-fitting. At the beginning of speech, the IGP expressed deep sympathy to the bereaved police families who lost their members during the fight against the virus. police / IGP / police", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/law/police-must-break-free-oppression-igp-101107", "date": "2020-07-02T21:15:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 02 July, 2020, 09:15 pm Last modified: 02 July, 2020, 09:18 pm", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 433, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:05.187655"}

A day after 40-year-old Stan Wawrinka led a parade of yesterday's heroes into the third round, the TikTok generation had their moment in the Melbourne Park sun. American 18-year-old Iva Jovic knocked out seventh seed Jasmine Paolini 6-2 7-6(3) while Canadian 19-year-old Victoria Mboko beat 14th seed Clara Tauson to book a last-16 blockbuster against twice-champion Sabalenka, a 7-6(4) 7-6(7) winner against Anastasia Potapova.

{"title": "Cristiano Ronaldo says he disagrees that Messi is better than him", "body": "Over the past 17 years, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have forged one of the most iconic rivalries in football history, battling each other for the Ballon d'Or and fuelling endless debate over who truly deserves the title of the greatest of all time. In a recent interview with journalist Piers Morgan, the Portuguese superstar — now playing for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia — was asked for his view on who is the better player. Unsurprisingly, Ronaldo did not hesitate to place himself ahead of his long-time rival, the Inter Miami forward. In a teaser for the interview, which is set to air next Tuesday, Morgan asks Ronaldo directly whether Messi is better than him. To this, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner confidently replies: \"Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble.\" True to the outspoken style that has defined his career, Ronaldo once again declared himself the best footballer of all time. Now in the twilight of his career, he has set his sights on reaching 1,000 career goals, aiming to become the first player in history to achieve the milestone. Despite his self-assured remarks, Ronaldo has often spoken with respect for Messi, praising the Argentine in various interviews over the years. He has also revealed that the pair share a cordial relationship, even expressing his wish to have dinner together someday. The first part of this in-depth interview — which delves into Ronaldo's life, career, and his legendary rivalry with Messi — will be released next Tuesday. The duo famously contested the Ballon d'Or between 2008 and 2023, while continuing their battle to become football's all-time leading goalscorer. After scoring a brace in his most recent outing for Al Nassr, Ronaldo has now amassed 952 career goals, leaving him just 48 short of 1,000. He already holds the record as the highest goalscorer in football history, yet remains determined to extend his lead even further. Messi, meanwhile, found the net in Inter Miami's defeat to Nashville, slightly narrowing the gap. With that goal, the 38-year-old Argentine moved on to 891 career goals, now 61 behind his Portuguese counterpart. cristiano ronaldo / Lionel Messi / Piers Morgan", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/cristiano-ronaldo-says-he-disagrees-messi-better-him-1276851", "date": "2025-11-04T14:00:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 04 November, 2025, 02:00 pm Last modified: 04 November, 2025, 03:57 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 364, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:09.581830"}

The groups, which include educational institutions such as Emory University and activist groups such as Greenpeace, among others, also want the company to recall existing inventory in North America. Janette Robinson Flint, the executive director of Black Women for Wellness, said in a statement that J&J's choice to continue marketing baby powder in international markets, often to Black and Brown consumers, contradicts a statement it issued in June committing to fighting racial inequality. Johnson & Johnson said in May it would stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, saying demand had fallen in the wake of what it called \"misinformation\" about the product's safety amid a barrage of legal challenges. However, J&J said it would continue to sell its talc-based products in other markets around the world. \"Decades of independent scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of Johnson's Baby Powder,\" J&J said in a statement on Wednesday. \"We continue to offer this product in many other regions around the world where there is higher consumer demand.\" J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc. The US drugmaker faces thousands of lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. The company said in May that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations.

{"title": "Hong Kong opposition kicks off primary elections under shadow of security law", "body": "Hong Kong's opposition camp set up polling booths across the Chinese-ruled city on Saturday for primary elections aimed at selecting democracy candidates who stand the best chance of success in Legislative Council elections in September. The primaries come less than two weeks after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on the Asian financial hub, stoking concerns that wide-ranging freedoms not seen in mainland China will be crushed. The law punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison and allows mainland security agents to operate officially in Hong Kong for the first time. On the eve of the primaries, police searched the office of independent pollster Robert Chung, whose Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) helps organise the election, raising concerns among activists of interference in the poll. \"The primary election is our first time to let Beijing know Hong Kongers never bow down to China,\" said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong ahead of the opening of polling booths at noon (0400 GMT). \"We urge the world to put Hong Kong under the global spotlight.\" While the primaries are only for the opposition camp, observers are watching closely as they say the turnout at the election will serve as a litmus test of broader opposition to the national security law. The election seeks to bolster the chance for democracy candidates to achieve a 35-plus majority in the 70-seat legislature in polls on September 6, potentially giving them power to block government proposals. Hong Kong's opposition camp secured a landslide victory in district council elections in November, riding on support for an anti-government protest movement triggered by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.

The model is now available worldwide through Xiaomi's MiMo Studio, Hugging Face and its API platform. The company says it performs strongly in reasoning, coding and agentic tasks. It is also designed to work as a general assistant for daily use. The move places Xiaomi in direct competition with models from DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, Anthropic and OpenAI. MiMo-V2-Flash is part of Xiaomi's broader push into advanced AI. Luo Fuli, a rising figure in China's AI scene who recently joined Xiaomi after working at DeepSeek, described the release as the second step on the company's path towards artificial general intelligence. That term refers to systems that could one day match or exceed human thinking. Speed and cost are central to Xiaomi's pitch — the company says the model processes up to 150 tokens per second, which makes it one of the most cost-effective high-performance models available. On technical benchmarks, Xiaomi reports results close to Moonshot AI's Kimi K2 Thinking and DeepSeek V3.2 Thinking. In some long-context tests, it says MiMo-V2-Flash performs better. On software engineering tasks, the model scored 73.4 per cent on SWE-Bench Verified, beating other open-source rivals and nearing the performance of OpenAI's GPT-5-High. Xiaomi also says its coding ability matches Claude 4.5 Sonnet at a far lower price. The model uses a Mixture-of-Experts design and has 309 billion parameters.

{"title": "DJI’s new Osmo Action 6 is a low-light specialist", "body": "What do you look for in an action camera? Most action camera enthusiasts will say: reliability. An action camera that simply works. They want clear video in changing light, steady footage on the move, and clips that slot easily into different social platforms without extra fuss. DJI's new Osmo Action 6 arrives with these practical needs in mind. It offers useful upgrades that help users deal with the most common shooting challenges. The device introduces two key features that give it an edge over its GoPro and Insta360 rivals. The first is a variable aperture. This is a rare tool in an action camera. It shifts between f/2.0 and f/4.0, and it gives the user more control in both bright streets and dim interiors. In low light, it admits enough illumination to keep footage clean and stable. In strong daylight it helps maintain sharpness without overexposure. However, the camera does not allow full manual control. Yet even with its limited aperture presets, the feature offers welcome flexibility for those who film in varied environments. The second is a new square sensor. It is larger than the one in the previous model. It produces sharper images at night and supports true 4K vertical resolution at 60 frames per second. This matters for anyone who needs to publish footage across different platforms. Horizontal videos for YouTube can sit alongside vertical clips for TikTok without rotating the device or sacrificing quality. It is a practical feature that reduces editing time and keeps options open. According to Engadget, these upgrades strengthen DJI's case in a market long dominated by rivals. Daytime shooters may still prefer the higher resolution of GoPro's Hero 13. But for night scenes, interior spaces, and quick format shifts, the Osmo Action 6 delivers clear advantages. action camera / DJI / Osmo Action 6", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/djis-new-osmo-action-6-low-light-specialist-1297201", "date": "2025-11-28T22:45:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 28 November, 2025, 10:45 pm Last modified: 30 November, 2025, 07:12 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 303, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:18.253989"}

But Ashreen Mridha, one of the forerunners of women's basketball in Bangladesh, seeks to empower women through basketball regardless of age, religion and socio-economic background. As a member of the national team, Ashreen participated in the first South Asian Women's Basketball (SABA) Championships in 2016, and captained the Kolkata-Bangladesh friendly series in India the same year. She became the first Bangladeshi basketball player to join the Global Sports Mentoring Program (GSMP) funded by ESPN and the United States. In this stressful time of Covid-19, the former captain of Bangladesh women's basketball team and currently the brand manager of Surf Excel at Unilever and an aspiring singer, Ashreen Mridha spoke to The Business Standard (TBS) about her life, basketball career and beyond. TBS: Life has come to a halt due to the pandemic. How's been life over the past few months? Ashreen: Last few months have been the slowest period in my entire life. For us athletes, it's quite unnatural to stay indoors for such a long time. I've been on a long break since September 2019 because of a ligament injury. I am on my feet now but I can't play. This is very frustrating. But I am taking this period for a lot of self-reflection and healing. TBS: How did you get into basketball, especially when it did not have a proper structure? Ashreen: I started playing basketball in 2000, when I was in grade four. The first time I was exposed to the sport when I went to observe the senior women's team's practice. My father was the in-charge of the sports management at Sunbeams School, where I studied. I used to observe what they did and tried to do those things by myself. That's how it all started and the rest is history. I immediately joined the Basketball Federation Training School and trained there for almost two years. I continued to play for the school team till 2006. But there was no basketball team in Mastermind college. So I kept looking for opportunities. I started playing for a local club called 'The Wild Cats'. After I had joined North South University, I formed the first ever women's basketball team there. I organized a lot of inter-university competitions. I played for the Women's national team from 2009 to 2018. I participated in the first ever South Asian Basketball Championship for Women that was held in 2016. Gradually I realized that I developed from being a player to becoming a sports activist for women. TBS: What are the challenges an aspiring basketball player has to face? Ashreen: Basketball is completely a niche sport in Bangladesh. You don't often see kids choosing to play basketball simply because they are not exposed to it. You cannot just play basketball anywhere. You need an engineered ground. There are not many basketball courts with public access. That is a huge drawback. Unlike cricket, you cannot ensure financial security playing basketball. But the number of challenges suddenly go up when we talk about women. The first challenge must be the lack of support from the family. Still now, women in Bangladesh are often subjected to give up on their personal dreams. But parents should respect the decision of a kid if he or she wants to take up a sport as a profession. Secondly, female athletes often have to face age discrimination. Female basketball players in our country are made to put an end to their career at the age of around 25. The basketball federation, the ministry and the organizations have a very primitive mindset when it comes to providing opportunities to female athletes across age groups. But I believe women need to be allowed to continue playing, either recreationally or professionally, as long as they are fit. A team needs time to grow. We have participated in tournaments but could not produce the results. As a result, enough opportunities are not being given to us. But if we are not given enough time and space to learn and grow, then it's difficult to do well. TBS: What steps can be taken to make women's basketball accessible to all parts of the country? Ashreen: There are few simple steps that can be taken to do so. First of all, free camps should be provided for girls so that they can learn how to play basketball and develop love for the game. Secondly, tournaments should be arranged on a regular basis so that players can showcase their talent and skills. Third and the most important step should be decentralizing basketball from the Metropolitan cities because there are so many talented athletes spread across different parts of the country. TBS: What are the highest points of your basketball career? Ashreen: The highest point of my basketball career would be when I represented Bangladesh in the South Asian Basketball Championship for women. It was our first appearance in an international tournament. Though we lost all the games, we met and played against top South Asian players and teams. It was an honourable moment for us to represent Bangladesh. Every time when we stood on the basketball court and heard the national anthem, it got me all teary eyed. TBS: You were the first Bangladeshi basketball player to join the GSMP funded by ESPN. Tell us something about the campaign. Ashreen: Basically the GSMP is a five-week program in the United States. The curriculum includes some on-ground activities and some classroom sessions. The sessions were held in Washington D.C. followed by a stint with one of the top US organizations. I was mentored by Laura Dixon, the head of the external relations of the sports and entertainment management of The Spurs, a noted NBA team. I spent two and a half weeks with the team. I got to know inside out how a sports based organization works. As an alumni, I am in touch with them and that helps me gather resources for Deshi Ballers, a non-profit organization that I run. Recently I've nominated five basketball players for an under-18 program in the US and they all got selected. These resources help me put Bangladesh in such prestigious platforms. I highly encourage female athletes to apply for this program and I am ready to do my best to help them. TBS: You are an artist as well. Is singing something that comes naturally to you or did you have any formal training? Ashreen: I didn't have much of a formal training but I do come from a family of musicians. My musical journey began at home as both my parents are singers. My brother Shafaat Mridha is also a guitarist. My brother and I have been part of a band called 'Silverlight' for many years though we're a bit inactive now. I think my parents did all the hard work with learning music and I just happened to get all the attributes for free in my blood. TBS: You have been promoting women's basketball through 'Deshi Ballers'. How did you come up with the idea of founding such a platform? Ashreen: Before founding Deshi Ballers, I was doing a lot of work regarding basketball development anyway. I just didn't have an organization as such. I co-founded Deshi Ballers in 2018 with Monika (Gulnahar Mahbub Monika) with a hashtag 'The Court Needs Her'. We arrange a lot of camps and off-court activities as well to groom future female leaders in sports. Currently we are focusing on women only but we do have plans to work with men in the future because men and women both need each other to make the sport grow. With Deshi Ballers, we want to bring some changes to the system and ensure faster growth of basketball, especially for women. TBS: How difficult is it to look after Surf Excel, Deshi Ballers and also balance the family life? Ashreen: I wouldn't say it's easy. But it's not impossible. It requires a fairly organized way of living. As a manager of your own life, you have to be able to juggle different things simultaneously. It's all about the correct prioritization. I have, over the years, learned to say no when I need to. Because I don't want to overwork myself and lose my passion. I always make sure that none of the aspects of my work clash with each other. I believe every person has the ability to do incredible things in life if they put their heart and mind. It's very important to figure out your circle of close friends with whom you are in a positive zone. So I believe with some level of discipline and organization in life, nothing is impossible.

{"title": "Farmers close 35,816 bank accounts in 3 months", "body": "The number of farmers' bank accounts fell by 35,816 during January-March 2020 mainly because of the banks' lower priority to those accounts. The figure of farmers' bank accounts dropped to 10,150,794 at the end of March this year from 10,186,605 three months ago, according to the Bangladesh Bank data. Considering the 9,989,906 bank accounts of the farmers at the end of March 2019, the number of accounts rose by 160,888 in one year. However, a Bangladesh Bank report released on Monday said 46,699 bank accounts of the farmers in Sonali Bank were closed during January-March 2020, leading to a fall in the account number. When asked, Sonali Bank Managing Director Ataur Rahman Prodhan told The Business Standard: \"Loan adjustments of the farmers and subsequent account closures could be the reason.\" Ataur also said, \"Sonali Bank has a Tk50 crore interest-free loan programme in progress which is meant for the farmers.\" However, as part of the central bank's financial inclusion programme introduced in 2010, banks are supposed to open bank accounts of farmers with an initial deposit of Tk10. The idea is to ensure transparent distribution of farm loans and subsidies and to bring farmers' savings into the banking channel. However, the central bank instruction barred banks from imposing any charge for maintaining these accounts. It made the banks reluctant to offer any incentive to the accountholders. The Bangladesh Bank report shows that the deposit in the farmers' bank accounts rose by only Tk10 lakh during January-March. With the increase, farmers' deposit in bank accounts reached only Tk351.86 crore. Each of the farmers' account contains only a deposit of Tk346.63 on average which reflects their capacity to save. However, the central bank earlier introduced a refinance scheme with a lower interest rate to make the Tk10 farmer accounts popular. Also, the central bank issued a circular saying that the farmers having Tk10 accounts would get loans under its refinance scheme worth Tk200 crore at the interest rate of 9.5 percent. According to the circular, the banks may impose a maximum 7 percent interest if they disburse loans under the scheme through microfinance institutions which will be allowed to charge the highest 9.5 percent interest on the loans. However, the initiative failed to get momentum. And the loan disbursement to the farmers at the end of March 2020 dropped to Tk135.22 crore from Tk142.85 crore three months ago.

{"title": "Pablakhali VCF: A forest guarded by its people", "body": "An eagle glides across the hilltops and settles on a teak branch in a vast forested landscape that the Chakma community has protected for generations. It is still morning. Winter mist lingers, with the sun concealed behind the hills. Layers of hills recede into the distance, wrapped in a soft haze. A lone brick road winds through the forest, and on either side, traces of human settlement quietly emerge atop gentle slopes. Amid the greenery, a Buddhist temple's stupa and a school building come into view. \"There is a 700-acre village common forest (VCF). We call it a reserve forest; some also refer to it as parabon or mouzabon,\" said Michael Chakma, one of the forest's dedicated protectors. The forest lies in 52 No Pablakhali Mouza of Dighinala upazila in Khagrachari district. At first glance, it is difficult for visitors to tell where human habitation ends and the reserve forest begins. As Michael put it, \"The forest is so vast that once you go deep inside, you are completely alone with nature.\" Pablakhali VCF is entirely protected and managed by the local Chakma community. At a time when the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT) are facing increased resource extraction, deforestation, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, this forest has emerged as a model of revival and community-led conservation. \"We do not allow anyone to collect resources in large quantities. People can only take what they need from resources that grow abundantly, such as fish, crabs, bamboo shoots, and vegetables,\" said Bikash Chakma, headman of the mouza. Traditionally, VCFs across the CHT are led by the mouza headman and village karbaris. Among the 379 VCFs across the three CHT districts, Pablakhali is one of the largest. The mouza is home to around 1,200 families across eight paras (villages). At least 500 families live in extreme poverty and depend heavily on forest resources. Despite this vulnerability, the community has shown resilience, supported by interventions from local government bodies, NGOs and international organisations such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This coexistence between people and forest began at least 60-70 years ago during the reign of Chakma Raja Tridib Roy. Recalling the history, Bikash said, \"Parts of the Maini Reserve Forest were declared open by the British. People were allowed to settle, cultivate land, and collect forest resources. Later, the mouza was established.\" Over time, the area of reserve forest has shrunk as the population has grown and resource extraction has continued. Today, the 700-acre forest is home to at least 60 plant species, along with diverse wildlife, birds, reptiles, fish, and snails. Two large streams and several creeks — locally known as chorra or jhiri — flow along two sides of the forest. These water bodies support a variety of fish and crab species until the dry season. Villagers said they only catch fish during the monsoon, when the streams are full. Teak (segun) dominates the forest, alongside sal, mahogany, gamhar, and white siris. Herbs, roots, and other medicinal plants are also abundant. The forest is rich in bamboo species. Residents collect limited quantities during the harvesting season for house construction, household items, and bamboo shoots, a popular vegetable known locally as bashkorol. The collection requires permission from the mouza headman. A study by Zabarang Kalyan Samity documented 17 common animal and bird species, including fishing cats, monkeys, deer, junglefowl, wild pigs, tortoises, and porcupines. With relatively abundant resources and higher biodiversity than many other VCFs in the CHT, Pablakhali has largely recovered compared to its condition a decade ago. At noon, Michel and fellow volunteers Purno Bikash, Sunil Kanti and Tuhin Chakma gathered at a tea stall along the brick road after returning from the forest. \"Every day we patrol the forest to check for illegal activities,\" said Tuhin, a karbari from Kripapur village near the forest. \"This includes cutting trees or bamboo, or anything that could harm the forest.\" Awareness among villagers has increased significantly. \"Even five years ago, people were reckless,\" said headman Bikash. \"They collected resources excessively, and recovery took a long time. Now that has changed.\" \"However, this would have been difficult without the intervention of the district council and UNDP,\" he added. In 2017, the Khagrachari District Council formally declared Pablakhali a VCF and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UNDP to jointly protect forest resources, biodiversity, and ecosystems. Under the project Biodiversity and Ecosystem Restoration for Community Resilience in Chittagong Hill Tracts, funded by the Canadian government, UNDP and the district council worked with communities living alongside the forest. \"Our focus is not only VCF management but also biodiversity conservation — protecting ecosystems and reducing pressure on forests,\" said Suketon Chakma, district officer of the project. The district council selected three paras and formed a biodiversity conservation group (BCG), comprising residents who depend on forest resources such as firewood, bamboo, and timber. \"We provide training and small-scale financial support to reduce dependency on forest resources,\" said Chinglamon Chawdhury, public relations officer of the Khagrachari District Council. Villagers said some forest-dependent families received Tk7,000 in cash during and after the Covid-19 period. To further reduce pressure on the forest, the district council introduced alternative livelihood training, including organic soap-making, livestock rearing, apiculture, and other agriculture-based activities. Visible improvements have followed. Piroj Chakma, a villager, admitted that he once regularly cut trees and collected forest resources. \"I had no choice; I had to survive,\" he said. \"Now I try not to collect anything except fish, crabs, and vegetables.\" Officials from UNDP and the district council have conducted multiple visits and para meetings. \"People now understand the importance of protecting the forest for long-term sustainability,\" said headman Bikash. He added that he and nine karbaris from different paras recently attended training and workshops at the district council on managing the forest without extracting resources or harming biodiversity. Local NGOs, including the Central Network of Village Common Forests, Arannayk Foundation, and Zabarang Kalyan Samity, also receive funding to support biodiversity protection. Their work includes training on climate change adaptation, resilient livelihoods, market access, wildlife hunting prevention, and bamboo clump management. As the afternoon turned to evening, Michel and the others continued their conversation. Rita Chakma then climbed the hillside, balancing three metal pots on her head and carrying another in her hand. \"During the dry season, we face severe water shortages. Very little water remains in the streams,\" Rita said. \"This is my second trip today. This water is only for cooking and drinking.\" For bathing and washing clothes, she must walk much farther, often along steep and isolated paths. The journey is physically exhausting and poses serious safety risks, particularly for women. Once known for its rich biodiversity, the CHT region is now facing an acute water crisis that disrupts daily life and livelihoods. Climate change, combined with unplanned land and resource management, has intensified these challenges. \"In recent decades, climate change and unplanned land and resource management have made life increasingly difficult in the hills,\" said Philip Gain, a researcher who has worked in the CHT for decades. \"Summers are becoming longer, monsoon rains are more irregular, and natural water sources are drying up.\" Due to the region's remote and hilly terrain, installing conventional water supply systems such as deep tube wells remains extremely difficult. As a result, the water crisis worsens each year, and the demand for safe drinking water continues to grow. \"Streams have always been our lifelines,\" said Bangu Chakma from Dojorpara. \"We dig wells in the streams and channel the water to our fields.\" He said villagers once found water easily, but prolonged dry seasons have drastically reduced water flow. \"We cannot cultivate in summer because there is no water. During the monsoon, land and wells are often washed away, and the water becomes muddy and unsafe to drink.\" Water scarcity is one of many challenges faced by forest-adjacent communities in Pablakhali mouza. Sukhshanti Chakma and his two brothers inherited a small plot of land. They grow rice on limited flat land at the base of the hills and cultivate broom grass on the surrounding slopes once a year. As jhum cultivation is prohibited, farming is restricted to inherited land. Broom grass, which is less harmful to the soil, has become a preferred crop. \"We don't have enough land for rice cultivation,\" Sukhshanti said. \"Broom grass brings a little income, but it's not enough.\" Agriculture is increasingly constrained by water scarcity, keeping production low and livelihoods fragile. Infrastructure poses another major challenge. Transport, electricity, and healthcare services are limited. \"Seven or eight years ago, there was no brick road through the forest,\" said Onil Bikash Chakma of Milonpur. \"We had to walk long distances just to reach the bazaar.\" Electricity has yet to reach the community, cutting residents off from basic services available just a few kilometres downhill. Healthcare is among the most urgent needs. Medical emergencies are especially difficult for women and children. \"When my daughter was born, I became seriously ill at night,\" said Shantona Chakma from Shantipur village. \"The hospital is five kilometres away, and there was no way to reach it quickly.\" Pablakhali / Village common forest / Khagrachari", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/pablakhali-vcf-forest-guarded-its-people-1344941", "date": "2026-01-27T11:50:00+06:00", "author": "Faisal Uddin Siam 27 January, 2026, 11:50 am Last modified: 27 January, 2026, 02:32 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1520, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:33.955916"}

{"title": "Sahara Khatun to be laid to rest on Saturday", "body": "Former minister Sahara Khatun will be laid to rest on Banani graveyard on Saturday. A special flight carrying her body will leave Bangkok airport for Dhaka at 9 pm (Bangladesh Standard Time). The flight is scheduled to arrive at Dhaka airport early Saturday, sources at Bangladesh Awami League told The Business Standard. Her namaz-e-janaza will take place at Banani Graveyard Mosque at noon and she will be laid to rest at the graveyard beside her mother. \"The namaz-e-janaza will take place on a limited scale. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has instructed everyone to maintain proper health guidelines while attending the namaz-e-janaza,\" Barrister Biplob Barua, office secretary of Awami League Central Committee told The Business Standard. Sahara Khatun, the first woman home minister of the country, breathed her last at 11:25 pm (BDST) on Thursday in Thailand's Bumrungrad International Hospital. She was flown there on July 6 for better treatment. Before going to Thailand, the 77-year-old lawmaker was undergoing treatment at the capital's United Hospital with several health complications since June 2. President Abdul Hamid, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and presidium members of Awami League have expressed deep sorrow at the death of Sahara Khatun. Born on March 1, 1943, Sahara Khatun was involved in politics since her student life. She entered the national political scene in 1991 when she contested in the 5th parliamentary election as an Awami League candidate. Since then, Sahara Khatun continued being a crucial part of Awami League's politics. She came in the scene again in 2008 upon the arrest of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the caretaker government's regime.

{"title": "Opposition lawmakers slam health minister for ‘failure’ to tackle Covid-19", "body": "Some lawmakers of opposition parties in parliament have come down heavily on Health Minister Zahid Maleque, claiming that his ministry has failed to tackle the coronavirus situation. The parliament was heated up on Tuesday while the opposition lawmakers in the house discussed their cut-motions regarding Tk22,883.86-crore demand in grant for the Health Services Division. The members of parliament of the opposition parties blamed the health minister for the dire state of the country's heath sector and some even demanded his removal from the office, reports the Prothom Alo. Jatiya Party Mujibul Haque (Kishoreganj-3) said had the health ministry taken any effective action to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the situation would not have turned so critical in the country. The personal protective equipment (PPE) given to the doctors and nurses are of low quality, he added. Criticising the services provided by public hospitals, he asked the prime minister to issue a directive so that no minister, MP and government official can receive treatment from hospitals other than the government ones, reports UNB. Mujibul Haque demanded that the private hospitals be brought under accountability too. BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid (Chapainawabganj-3) claimed that the Covid-19 infection rate in Bangladesh is the highest in the world, but the country is carrying out a small number of tests every day. He said, \"It is a big weakness in our health sector that we have various infrastructures in government hospitals at division, district and upazila levels, but the number of technologists is so limited that people who go to the hospitals for treatment after 12:00 pm, do not get tested.\" \"Therefore, the number of technologists will have to be increased so that poor people can avail 24-hour testing facilities,\" Harun said. The BNP lawmaker said there is no way to deny the fact that Bangladesh's entire medical system has become dependent on India. \"In the last 10 years, over one crore people went to India for treatment,\" he said. Jatiya Party Lawmaker Pir Fazlur Rahman (Sunamganj-4) urged the prime minister to replace incumbent Health Minister Zahid Maleque with Begum Matia Chowdhury. \"The people of my constituency asked me to place it [their desire] before the prime minister,\" he said. Another Jatiya Party lawmaker Shameem Haider Patwary (Gaibandha-1), demanded that a basic health database for all citizens in the country be prepared and enough medical technologists be recruited. Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Firoz Rashid (Dhaka-6) said there is no coordination between the ministry and the Directorate General of Health Services to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Rowshan Ara Mannan (Women Seat-47) said the health sector should be given the highest priory to deal with the situation. In response, the health minister highlighted the various steps taken by his ministry and claimed that he was in the field, reports the Prothom Alo. Responding to the allegations of irregularities in hotels and food costs of doctors and health workers at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the minister said the allegations were not correct as some 3,700 people stayed there in 50 hotels for a month, and Tk500 per person was given as food cost for three meals a day – breakfast, lunch and dinner. \"The rent for each room was Tk1,100 per day.\" Noting that the costs were not so high, he said, \"The food cost that was said [in allegation] is not correct.\" Zahid Maleque said there is now no allegation about the standard of the PPE. The government has already sent 30 lakh sets of PPE to different hospitals, reports UNB. He said now every private hospital is providing medical treatment though their service charges are high to some extent. \"The government will fix service charges.\" The minister said there was an outcry for ventilators initially, but now it seems there is no need for that. \"We have some 400 ventilators. But, 50 of those are not used. Most of the patients put under ventilator support died.\" He said the Covid-19 death rate among the infected people is low due to the measures taken by the government. The government has recruited some 2,000 doctors and 6,000 nurses within a quick time to deliver medical services to corona patients, increased the number of hotlines to 50 from five, introduced telemedicine services, prepared patient guidelines, a modern protocol for doctors and other health workers, he said, reports UNB. The minister said 14,000 beds have been designated for Covid-19 patients in the country's hospitals and 40 percent of those are still vacant, reports UNB. \"It is not like that patients are not getting treatment in any hospital of Bangladesh. As of today, we have 60 percent beds occupied while 40 percent are still vacant. We have some 14,000 beds for Covid-19 patients,\" he said. The health minister also said that high-flow oxygen lines are essential for Covid-19 patients. So, the government has taken the initiative for arranging 1,000 high-flow oxygen systems and 10,000 new oxygen cylinders.

{"title": "‘Don’t regret leaving Stuart Broad out’: England captain Ben Stokes after losing Southampton Test", "body": "The decision to leave veteran pacer Stuart Broad out of the England team for the first Test against West Indies in Southampton has received a fair share of criticism from all corners. On the final day of the match, England needed to defend the target of 201, and despite a good start with the ball, the hosts were unable to keep Windies batting line-up at bay and the visitors went on to pull off a 4-wicket win to take 1-0 lead in the series. As expected, fans started questioning whether the decision to drop Broad proved to be the fatal one for England and if things could have been different on the final day if he was in the team. On being asked about the same at the post-match presentation ceremony, Stokes said that he does not regret the decision to leave Broad out of the team. \"I don't regret leaving Stuart Broad out, and we are fortunate to leave someone like him out. I would be upset if he didn't show the passion he did in that interview, and he's nowhere near done. If he plays in the second Test I hope he walks off with some wickets,\" Stokes said. England had picked three pacers in the team for the first Test - Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and James Anderson. In a recent interview with Sky News, Broad expressed his emotions on the decision and said that he was 'angry' and 'frustrated' over the decision. \"I've been frustrated, angry and gutted because it's quite a hard decision to understand. I've probably bowled the best I've ever bowled in the last couple of years. I felt like it was my shirt, having been in the team through the Ashes and going to South Africa and winning there,\" Broad had said. Elaborating further on the situation with Broad, Stokes, at the post-match press conference said: \"We made a decision based around thinking pace was going to stand us a better place in the long game. Stuart is a fantastic bowler and he understands the reasons why.\" \"If I was to regret that, I don't think that sends the right message to the other guys I picked. Looking at the interview he gave I thought it was absolutely brilliant, to see the desire and passion that he showed,\" he further added.

{"title": "US-brokered peace talks break off without deal after overnight Russian bombardment of Ukraine", "body": "Ukraine and Russia ended a second day of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi today (24 January) without a deal but with future meetings mooted after overnight Russian airstrikes that knocked out power for over a million Ukrainians amid subzero winter cold. Statements after the conclusion of the talks did not indicate that any agreements had been reached, but Moscow and Kyiv both said they were open to further dialogue. \"The central focus of the discussions was the possible parameters for ending the war,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on X after the meeting. \"As a result of the meetings held over these days, all sides agreed to report back in their capitals on each aspect of the negotiations and to coordinate further steps with their leaders,\" he said, adding that further meetings could take place as early as next week. A UAE government spokesperson said there was face-to-face engagement between Ukraine and Russia - rare in the almost four-year-old war triggered by a full-scale Russian invasion - and tackled \"outstanding elements\" of Washington's peace framework. A spokesperson for Ukraine's lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, told reporters just before 5 pm Abu Dhabi time (1300 GMT) that the discussions had concluded. Bombardment of Ukraine before second day of talks The bombardment of Ukraine's capital Kyiv and its second largest city Kharkiv by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles prompted Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha - who was not at the talks - to accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of acting \"cynically\". \"This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at (US President Donald Trump's) Board of Peace, but in the dock of the special tribunal,\" Sybiha wrote on X. \"His missiles hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table.\" Saturday was scheduled to be the final day of the talks, billed by Zelenskiy as the first trilateral meeting under the US-mediated peace process. The UAE statement said the talks were conducted in a \"constructive and positive atmosphere. \"(They) included direct engagement between Russian and Ukrainian representatives on outstanding elements of the US-proposed peace framework, as well as confidence-building measures aimed at supporting progress toward a comprehensive agreement,\" it added. Kyiv is under mounting Trump administration pressure to make concessions to reach a deal to end Europe's deadliest and most destructive conflict since World War Two. Zelenskiy had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready for peace. US peace envoy Steve Witkoff said at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos this week that a lot of progress had been made in the talks and only one sticking point remained. However, Russian officials have sounded more sceptical. Russia wants all of Donbas After Saturday's talks, Zelenskiy said the US delegation had raised the issue of \"potential formats for formalising the parameters for ending the war, as well as the security conditions required to achieve this\". Ahead of the discussions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday Russia had not dropped its insistence on Ukraine yielding all of its eastern area of Donbas, the industrial heartland grouping the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to any deal. Most countries recognise Donetsk as part of Ukraine. Putin says Donetsk is part of Russia's \"historical lands\". Zelenskiy has ruled out giving up territory that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare against a much smaller foe. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for any territorial concessions. Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive. Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said late on Friday that the first day of talks had addressed parameters for ending the war and the \"further logic of the negotiation process.\" Meanwhile, Ukraine came under renewed Russian bombardment. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the overnight salvo, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of Kyiv, the capital. At least one person was killed and over 30 injured. Before Saturday's bombardment, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that cut electricity and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 degrees Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian assault. Zelenskiy said on Saturday Russia's heavy overnight strikes showed that agreements on further air defense support made with Trump in Davos this week must be \"fully implemented\". peace talks / Abu Dhabi / Ukraine-Russia war / Donbas", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/us-brokered-peace-talks-break-without-deal-after-overnight-russian-bombardment-ukraine-1342716", "date": "2026-01-24T21:55:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 24 January, 2026, 09:55 pm Last modified: 24 January, 2026, 10:07 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 824, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:45.284985"}
{"title": "Apex Tannery to set up own ETP at cost of Tk12cr", "body": "Apex Tannery, a listed leather goods manufacturer, has decided to set up an in-house effluent treatment plant (ETP) at a cost of Tk12 crore to meet regulatory requirements and comply with the environmental standards demanded by international buyers. The company made the decision at a recent board meeting and disclosed it through the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) website. Although Apex Tannery had earlier obtained approval to establish its own ETP at its factory premises in the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation Savar Leather Industrial Estate, it is now moving forward with the investment. Currently, there is a central effluent treatment plant (CETP) at the Savar tannery estate, but due to its technical limitations and inability to treat the full volume of liquid waste generated by all factories, some entrepreneurs have taken steps to set up their own ETPs to support business operations. According to the disclosure, Apex Tannery's in-house ETP will include a chrome recovery plant and a sewerage treatment plant, and will be built on an area of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 square feet. The facility will be designed to treat effluent generated at all stages of production – from wet blue to finished leather. The decision comes at a time when Apex Tannery has been struggling financially. According to its latest financial statements, the company has been incurring losses for three consecutive fiscal years since FY23. Due to the continued losses, the company did not declare any dividend for its shareholders. The company remained in a loss-making position in the first quarter of the current fiscal year as well. During the July-September period, its revenue edged up to Tk13.97 crore from Tk12.91 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal year, but it still incurred a loss of Tk7.59 crore, with a loss per share of Tk4.98. Today, the company's shares closed at Tk59.90 each on the DSE, up 4.90% from the previous session.

{"title": "Jashore's Gadkhali emerges hub of flower cultivation", "body": "Gadkhali–Panisara in Jhikargachha upazila of Jashore district has emerged as a source of flowers as farmers are getting good profit from flower cultivation. The entire region has transformed into a breathtaking sea of colour as fields burst with marigolds, roses, gerberas, gladiolus, chrysanthemums and sunflowers. The dazzling hues and sweet fragrances now dominate the vast stretches known nationally as the flower capital of Bangladesh. With the arrival of December, Gadkhali's flower market has entered its busiest and most profitable period. For flower growers, the five months from December to April are considered the golden season, particularly because demand surges around major national and cultural events - Martyred Intellectuals Day, Victory Day, Independence Day, Christmas, Bangla New Year, Valentine's Day, Spring Festival and International Mother Language Day. Nearly half of the yearly flower business takes place during these special occasions. As a result, farmers across Gadkhali and Panisara are now working tirelessly to keep up with the growing demand. Mehedi Hasan, a flower farmer from Panisara, cultivated China roses on 15 kathas of land this year. Good weather has brought him a good yield. \"Growers will earn a handsome amount of money if good market prices are ensured,\" he added. Veteran flower farmer Aziz Sardar, who has been in the business for 42 years, planted gerbera, marigold, China rose and tuberose on 5 bighas of land. Taking a risk, he grew sunflowers for the first time — a gamble that seems to have paid off. His field is now bright with towering sunflower blooms, which he expects to sell from early January at Tk100–120 per stem. Another Panisara farmer, Saiful Islam, set up a large shed spanning 33 decimal of land to cultivate gerbera flowers, investing Tk11 lakh in its construction. His plants began blooming three months after planting, and he is currently harvesting 1,000 to 1,500 flowers daily, selling each for Tk10. He expects prices to rise significantly as special days approach. According to Abdur Rahim, president of the Gadkhali Flower Traders Cooperative Society, more than 6,000 farmers cultivate flowers on around 2,000 hectares of land in the Gadkhali–Panisara region. These flowers are supplied not only to nearby districts but to almost every district in Bangladesh, including Dhaka. He estimates that if weather and political conditions remain favourable, the area conducts flower trade worth Tk4,000-500 crore annually, with half of that generated between December and April. \"This year's production has been excellent,\" he said. \"Now all we need is national stability so farmers can earn fair profits during the peak days.\" Since the start of December, the Gadkhali flower market has become a hive of activity. Farmers arrive before dawn with fresh harvests, and most buying and selling is completed by 9am. From there, flowers are sorted, bundled and transported across the country — often on the roofs of Nasimons, Karimons, trucks and buses — carrying Gadkhali's message of celebration far and wide. Traders expect flower arrivals to surge within days, as this is the peak season. With fields in full bloom, Gadkhali stands ready once again to colour Bangladesh's festivals with its vibrant blossoms. jashore / flower / Flower business / Flower farming / Flower market / Flower prices / Flower Garden", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/districts/jashores-gadkhali-emerges-hub-flower-cultivation-1307171", "date": "2025-12-11T14:35:00+06:00", "author": "BSS 11 December, 2025, 02:35 pm Last modified: 11 December, 2025, 02:40 pm", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 533, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:49.454667"}
{"title": "BNP will ensure economic democratisation if elected: Amir Khasru", "body": "Economic democratisation would be implemented if the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) comes to power through people's votes, BNP Standing Committee member and former commerce minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said today (22 December). \"Democracy cannot be established through political change alone if people are excluded from economic participation and do not share in the benefits of growth. If real democracy is to be established, the economic rights of the people of Bangladesh must be restored. We do not want to see politics based on patronage in the country,\" he said while speaking as the chief guest at a programme at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Chattogram Bay View. The event was a business dialogue on trade, commerce, the economy and investment, organised by the Chattogram Divisional Business Forum, with representatives from various business forums and trade bodies of the division in attendance. He said businesspeople had told him they want to operate in a supportive environment, with clear policies and the freedom to do business. \"Bangladesh is a highly regulated country. Opening a restaurant requires approvals from 19 to 21 authorities, while obtaining environmental clearance for shipbreaking can take up to two months,\" he said. \"We have to move away from a situation where every business is overregulated across sectors,\" he added. \"So our policy is to pursue serious deregulation,\" he said, adding that Bangladesh ranks very low in terms of economic liberalisation and ease of doing business. Recalling his tenure as commerce minister, Amir Khasru said leaders of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) once told him they needed utilisation declaration certificates, which were then issued by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). He said obtaining these certificates involved harassment and demands for unofficial payments. \"Businesspeople asked me to 'fix' the EPB. Since it was powerful, I told them the authority to issue utilisation declaration certificates should be taken out of the bureau and handed over to the BGMEA. Now they issue the certificates themselves,\" he said. He added that many protests were launched against him over the decision because issuing the certificates had been a source of cash income for the bureau. \"If we are given responsibility in the future, we will remove whatever is being blocked by bureaucracy,\" he said. \"We will ask business organisations to build capacity and operate properly, professionally, independently and transparently, so that many responsibilities of the government can be handed over to them,\" he added. Emphasising the need to expand employment, Amir Khasru said small and medium enterprises are the main contributors to the economy. \"Economic growth is not possible without increasing employment, and gross domestic product will not rise unless job creation expands,\" he said. \"BNP has pledged to build a $500 trillion economy, but this would not be possible without the growth of small and medium enterprises,\" he added. To support this, he said facilities such as bonded warehouses and back-to-back letters of credit, similar to those available in the readymade garment sector, would be ensured for all export-oriented sectors. \"There should be no need for businesses to move from office to office,\" he said, adding that automation must be introduced to reduce physical contact. \"Physical contact between businesspeople and government officials must be kept to a minimum,\" he said, adding that this should apply not only to businesses but also to ordinary citizens. He also said technology would be used in the future to reduce harassment at ports and shorten container release times. \"Only 2% of cargo will be inspected, and that too through algorithms and software,\" he said. \"As a result, there will be no discretionary decision-making by customs officials. Corruption and extortion will no longer exist,\" he added. During the dialogue, businesspeople raised various problems they face and spoke about sector-specific barriers and possible solutions.

{"title": "Amazon cuts 16,000 corporate jobs, undoing pandemic-era hiring amid AI push", "body": "Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts on Wednesday (28 January), completing a plan for around 30,000 since October while leaving open the possibility of further reductions. Although 30,000 represents a small portion of Amazon's 1.58 million employees, who are mostly in fulfilment centres and warehouses, it is nearly 10% of its corporate workforce. Reuters first reported last week that Amazon was planning a second round of job cuts as part of the broader goal. The cuts were necessary to strengthen the company by \"reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy\" at Amazon, its top human resources executive, Beth Galetti, said in a post. Galetti left open the possibility of further losses, saying some teams will continue to \"make adjustments as appropriate\". The latest cuts mark the second major round of layoffs in three months after Amazon pared 14,000 jobs in October, saying at the time that artificial intelligence and concerns over shifting corporate culture were to blame. Amazon has also said it overhired during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for online shopping skyrocketed. \"Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months,\" Galetti said in Wednesday's note. \"That's not our plan,\" she said. Amazon on Tuesday mistakenly sent an email appearing to refer to the layoff plan as \"Project Dawn\" to some Amazon Web Services staff, unsettling thousands of workers. Rising AI Adoption The job cuts also underscore how artificial intelligence is changing corporate workforce dynamics. Significant improvements in AI assistants are helping enterprises execute duties from routine administrative tasks to complex coding problems with rapid speed and precision, driving widespread adoption. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last summer that the increased use of AI tools would lead to more automation of duties, resulting in corporate job losses. Executives at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos said last week that while jobs would disappear, new ones would spring up, with two telling Reuters that AI would be used as an excuse by companies planning to cut jobs anyway. Tech giants, including Amazon, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, had sharply ramped up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic demand surge and have lately been restructuring their workforce. Amazon began the cuts on Tuesday by announcing it planned to close all remaining brick-and-mortar Fresh grocery stores and Go markets, a further retreat from its physical store strategy. The company has been investing in robotics at its warehouses to speed up packaging and deliveries for its e-commerce segment, reduce the reliance on human labour and cut costs. Shares in Amazon, which is set to report quarterly results next week, were up less than 1% in pre-market trading.

{"title": "India celebrates 77th Republic Day with military, cultural displays", "body": "India marked its 77th Republic Day today (26 January) with a display of military hardware and cultural heritage at Kartavya Path. The ceremony, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the National War Memorial, was themed around the 150th anniversary of the national song, \"Vande Mataram.\" India's President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the event. The ceremony was also attended by European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as chief guests. Murmu reached the parade site in a ceremonial buggy, accompanied by the EU leaders, adding significant diplomatic weight to the proceedings. For the first time, Indian Army contingents marched in a combat-ready \"battle array formation,\" intended to demonstrate operational preparedness. The parade showcased several major defence platforms, including the BrahMos missile system, Akash air defence, Suryastra rocket systems, and Arjun main battle tanks. A notable segment of the parade included mock-ups of weapon systems and units that were deployed during last year's 88-hour conflict, named \"Operation Sindoor\" in May 2025. This included a tri-services tableau linked to the military campaign against targets in Pakistan and advanced missile systems developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The flypast featured fighter aircraft and helicopters, while the ground parade included a European Union military team. This team comprised four flag bearers carrying the flags of the European Union, the EU military staff, and the naval forces Atalanta and Aspides. Cultural and developmental tableaux A total of 30 tableaux – 17 from states and territories and 13 from various ministries – travelled down the parade route. These displays highlighted India's cultural diversity and modern progress, ranging from Assam's terracotta heritage to Kerala's Water Metro and digital literacy initiatives. A special Bollywood-themed tableau, celebrating the history and global impact of the Indian film industry, was also featured. The cultural segment included traditional dance performances from across the country, with participants wearing vibrant regional attire. The event took place under stringent security, with 30,000 personnel deployed across New Delhi and extensive drone surveillance in place. The presence of top EU leadership was highlighted as a mark of strengthening ties. In a social media post, Ursula von der Leyen described the invitation as an honour, stating that a stable and prosperous India benefits the global community. Earlier in the day, Modi placed a wreath at the National War Memorial to pay tribute to fallen soldiers. The formal ceremony began shortly after with the unfurling of the national flag, followed by the national anthem and a traditional gun salute.

Earlier in the day, Modi placed a wreath at the National War Memorial to pay tribute to fallen soldiers. The formal ceremony began shortly after with the unfurling of the national flag, followed by the national anthem and a traditional gun salute.

{"title": "‘It was like a slap’: Venkatesh Prasad reveals new details regarding sledging incident with Aamer Sohail", "body": "Venkatesh Prasad's famous send-off to Aamer Sohail remains one of the most talked-about moments in the history of India-Pakistan cricket. During the 1996 World Cup, Sohail had crashed Prasad for a boundary through covers and pointed his fingers at the bowler, almost mocking him to go and fetch the ball from the boundary. However, what happened on the next ball is remembered as one of the greatest comebacks of all time with Prasad knocking over Sohail's off stump. 24 years later, Prasad recalled the incident, explaining what led to those memorable couple of deliveries. Chasing 288 to win, Pakistan had gotten off to a strong start putting 84 runs for the first wicket and the former India fast bowler revealed what spurred him after Sohail cracked a boundary off him. \"It was actually sort of a slap (via the off-side), he came down the track and hit the ball towards the point and extra-cover region. I didn't expect that coming. It was a high-pressure game, with 35,000 people in the stadium,\" Prasad told R Ashwin on his YouTube show, DRS with Ash. \"Before the incident happened, I was at the boundary line. They were smashing us. It looked like the match would get over in 45 overs. I was watching the crowd, standing at fine-leg. I could see everybody was on the edge of their seats. They couldn't believe what was happening. That's how the situation was. \"He came down the track and gave himself a bit of room and hit me for a boundary, he showed his bat and showed his fingers towards the place where he hit the bat. We were quite close, I had completed my follow-through, he said 'I am going to hit you there the next ball'. I just heard him say that, I just used a couple of words and went back. There was a lot going through. A YouTube video of the incident has received over a million views. After Anwar was dismissed for 48, Sohail was expected to bat on but he clearly had a rush of adrenaline and his off stump went crashing the next ball. Pakistan's middle order couldn't do much, and even though Saleem Malik and Javed Miandad (playing his last tournament) tried, their low strike-rate did not help Pakistan's cause. Besides, Prasad and Kumble picked up three wickets each to dent Pakistan's chase and India won the match by 39 runs to advance to the semifinal. \"As such, they were smashing us and no one could believe what was happening. I, for some reason, though I was not as quick as Srinath, I would never want a batsman to dominate me. It's been my character. The moment someone dominates me, irrespective of who it is, I would like to give it back,\" Prasad said. \"At the same time, you have got to keep your cool, make sure you're in the game, make sure you're able to think well and execute well. A lot of thoughts were crossing my mind when I was going back. I had to make a decision. Then I said 'this is what I have practiced all my life. \"Bowl in the corridor, don't give width to the batsman and bowl stump to stump'. And I just backed myself, kept my cool of course, didn't really go back to what happened in the previous ball or what's going to happen the next ball.\" Venkatesh Prasad / Aamer Sohail / India Cricket Team / Pakistan Cricket Team", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/it-was-slap-venkatesh-prasad-reveals-new-details-regarding-sledging-incident-aamer-sohail", "date": "2020-07-15T14:45:00+06:00", "author": "Hindustan Times 15 July, 2020, 02:45 pm Last modified: 15 July, 2020, 02:50 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 581, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:19:57.953441"}
{"title": "Magnificent Smith reaches third ton of Ashes series", "body": "Majestic Steve Smith scored his third century of the Ashes series as Australia reached 245 for five at lunch on the second day of the fourth test at Old Trafford. Smith was fortunate to survive the second over of the day when Jofra Archer dropped a caught and bowled chance after his full toss was driven straight back at him. While England will rue that missed opportunity to remove the world’s top ranked test batsman, who has looked in form despite missing the last test due to concussion, Stuart Broad did give the home crowd some early cheer. Broad removed Travis Head, who had struggled throughout his innings, with a plumb leg before to leave the tourists at 183 for four. But after a nervy start, Smith found his comfort zone in more suitable conditions then Wednesday’s gusty winds and rain. Matthew Wade (16) looked less comfortable and eventually fell to the left-arm spin of Jack Leach, coming down the track but only succeeding in a mistimed drive which lopped high to Joe Root at mid-on. Smith though, whose lowest score in this series is 92 at Lord’s, brought up his century off 160 balls when he whipped a full delivery from Craig Overton past mid-on. It was Smith’s 26th century in 67 matches and his fifth in his last eight Ashes’ innings. The Australian, returning in this series after a 12 month ban for his role in a ball-tampering affair, celebrated only briefly, clearly a sign he believes he has plenty more work to do.

{"title": "New microcredit bank in the offing, to operate on social business model", "body": "The interim government has moved to institutionalise the \"social business\" model championed by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, unveiling a draft ordinance to establish a specialised \"Microcredit Bank\". Designed to bypass conventional banking hurdles, the proposed institution aims to finance small-scale and emerging entrepreneurs through a unique structure where borrowers hold a majority stake. The bank will operate largely outside the regulatory reach of the Bangladesh Bank. Infograph: TBS A new regulatory frontier The Financial Institutions Division of the finance ministry published the draft ordinance on the proposed microcredit bank on its website this week, inviting stakeholder feedback. According to the proposal, the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA), rather than the central bank, will serve as the sole licensing and supervisory body. Furthermore, the bank will be exempt from the Bank Company Act regarding liquidation and other standard banking regulations, marking a significant departure from the country's traditional financial framework. Guided by social business principles The initiative follows a directive from Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who recently emphasised that the institution must function on \"trust and confidence\" rather than collateral. Zahid Hussain, former Lead Economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office and a member of the banking reform task force, noted that the ordinance provides the first formal legal framework for social business in Bangladesh's financial sector. \"The core concept is that capital providers cannot take profits exceeding their initial investment,\" he explained. \"Any surplus must be reinvested. This creates an alternative to the corporate, profit-maximising models that currently dominate the sector.\" Operational scope and capital The draft outlines a versatile mandate for the Microcredit Bank, allowing it to: Provide venture capital: Invest in the establishment and expansion of small businesses. Supply physical assets: Provide industrial and agricultural machinery, livestock, and raw materials via credit. Offer holistic support: Provide technical, administrative, and marketing advice, alongside insurance facilities for borrowers. Manage savings: Collect deposits from both borrowers and the general public. The bank will launch with an authorised capital of Tk300 crore, divided into shares with a face value of Tk100. The initial paid-up capital is set at Tk100 crore. A seven-member board will oversee operations, featuring three directors elected by borrower-shareholders and three by other shareholders. Concerns However, Towfiqul Islam Khan, additional director (research) at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), expressed reservations. He pointed out that many activities planned for the new bank are already being carried out by existing Microcredit Regulatory Authority-licensed microcredit financial institutions, such as Grameen Bank. He suggested that instead of establishing a new bank, the focus should be on strengthening the Microcredit Regulatory Authority to gradually expand the services offered by existing institutions. Towfiqul also raised concerns about the impact of a new bank on the current economic situation, predicting it could create extreme competition in the market. Given the upcoming national election, he added that obtaining consent from political parties before operationalising the new bank would be prudent. Microcredit landscape According to the report published by the Microcredit Regulatory Authority last June, 724 licensed microcredit financial institutes are serving 4.16 crore members, including 3.22 crore borrowers, which have significantly contributed to financial inclusion. These institutions, with over 2.23 lakh employees and 26,071 branches, have become an economic hub for providing employment and financial services, especially to marginalised people across the country. In June 2024, the total loan outstanding and savings of these institutions were Tk1,59,410 crore and Tk68,591 crore, respectively. In the fiscal 2023-24, their total loan disbursement was Tk2,61,524 crore, of which about 50% was in the agricultural sector for the marginal level. In the message provided in that report, Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur stated that in FY2024, government and non-government banks contributed to microfinance with 5.6 lakh members and 4 lakh borrowers. They managed Tk8,685 crore in loans, Tk1,868 crore in savings, and Tk5,802 crore in disbursements.

Copyright owners, such as television and movie studios, must opt out of having their work appear in the video feed, company officials said, describing it as a continuation of its prior policy toward image generation. The copyright policy is likely to ruffle feathers throughout Hollywood. The ChatGPT-maker has been in talks with a variety of copyright holders in recent weeks to discuss the policy, company officials said. At least one major studio, Disney, has already opted out of having their material appear in the app, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this year, OpenAI pressed the Trump administration to declare that training AI models on copyrighted material fell under the \"fair use\" provision in copyright law. \"Applying the fair use doctrine to AI is not only a matter of American competitiveness — it's a matter of national security,\" OpenAI argued in March. Without this step, it said at the time, US AI companies would lose their edge over rivals in China. OpenAI officials said it put measures in place to block people from creating videos of public figures or other users of the app without permission. Public figures and others' likeness cannot be used until they upload their own AI-generated video and give their permission. One such step is a \"liveness check\" where the app prompts a user to move their head in different directions and recite a random string of numbers. Users will be able to see drafts of videos that involve their likeness. Videos in the Sora app can be up to 10 seconds long. OpenAI built a feature it calls Cameo that will let users create realistic-looking AI versions of themselves and insert themselves into AI-generated scenes. \"Our companies are in the business of competing for time and modifying consumer behavior,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a research note, adding he saw Sora app as a direct competitor to longstanding social media and digital content platforms from Meta, Google, TikTok and others.

{"title": "Master Feed to go public for Tk30cr", "body": "Master Feed Agrotec wants to raise Tk30 crore from the stock market through an initial public offering for its business expansion. Manufacturing and marketing poultry, fish and cattle feeds are the main activities of the company. It is also engaged in poultry and fish farming. The company has applied to the Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission to raise the fund by issuing three crore ordinary shares with a face value of Tk10. Ordinary shares – a synonym of common shares – represent equity ownership in a company proportionally with all other ordinary shareholders, and receive dividends at the discretion of the company's management. Master Feed Agrotec allocates Tk16.33 crore for the acquisition of a plant and purchasing machinery, Tk2.72 crore for constructions, Tk5.90 crore for setting up a fully automatic chicken farm and Tk3.16 crore for working capital. According to the last audited report, Master Feed Agrotec's net profit was Tk6.19 crore, an increase from Tk3.31 crore in the previous year. In the first quarter of the last fiscal year, the company's net profit was Tk1.77 crore, which was Tk1.17 crore in the same period of the previous year. Last year, its net revenue was Tk91.46 crore, an 80.68 percent increase from that of the previous year. At the same time, its earnings per share were Tk1.08, up from Tk0.58 in the previous year. The net asset value per share of the company was Tk12.64 as of September 30, 2019. The company has a number of competitors in the sector. Of them, Aman Feed and National Feed Mills are listed on the stock market. Besides, Quality Feed, Paragon Feed Mill, Nourish Poultry and Hatchery, Provita Feed Mill, New Hope Feed Mill (bd), Kazi Feed, ACI-Godrej Agrovet (Pvt), Aftab Feed Products, Advance Poultry and Fish Feed, CP Bangladesh Company and Oryza Agro Industries Ltd are also the strong competitors of Master Feed Agrotec. Md Kabir Hossain, managing director of Master Feed Agrotec, told The Business Standard, \"We produce quality products for poultry and fish. The company's both projects are situated in its lands; that is why we do not have a big loan.\" He said they want to raise the capital from the stock market only for the company's business expansion. \"If we can complete the projects, we will provide the customers with all kinds of poultry and fish feeds,\" added Md Kabir. He expects that the number of customers will increase three to four times. \"We want to set up a fully automatic chicken farm aimed at reducing production cost and getting the best quality. So, hopefully, we will do better in the future,\" said the Master Feed managing director. The company's authorised capital was Tk100 crore. The paid-up capital was Tk57.15 crore and the post paid-up capital was Tk87.15 crore. The company was incorporated in 2011 as \"Master Hatchery and Poultry Feed Limited\". Later in 2018, it was renamed as \"Master Feed Agrotec Limited\". According to the Feed Industries Association Bangladesh, the feed manufacturing industry has grown up gradually in the country, and it saw annual growth of 15- 18 percent for years. There are 201 feed factories registered with the Department of Livestock Services. The annual demand for poultry feed in Bangladesh is around 6.3-6.4 million tonnes, and it is expected to rise to 6.5-7 million tonnes in 2021. At present, the amount of imported poultry and fish feed is almost at zero level. Some 98 percent of the total demand is being met by the local commercial production. The remaining 2 percent is still handmade. Asian Tiger Capital Partners Investments Ltd and NBL Capital & Equity Management Ltd are working as issue managers of Master Feed Agrotec Limited.

The annual tournament was originally scheduled to begin on March 29 but was postponed indefinitely due to Covid-19. India's death toll from the pandemic surpassed 20,000 on Tuesday. Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates have offered to host the league but BCCI treasurer Arun Singh Dhumal said the board was optimistic about staging it on home soil. \"We've to consider India first and then think of overseas,\" Dhumal told Reuters. \"They have sent these proposals in case we want to organise it there. \"We will discuss it in the next IPL governing council meeting where we will take a call.\" The 2009 edition of the franchise-based league, which coincided with India's elections, was held in South Africa and the UAE hosted the early matches of the tournament five years later for the same reason. The BCCI, facing a $535 million loss of revenue if it cannot stage the IPL this year, would be keen to slot it into the Twenty20 World Cup's October-November window if that event was unable to go ahead in Australia due to the pandemic.

In a morning notification, Bajus said it had raised the price of 22-carat hallmarked gold by Tk5,424 per bhori. Later in the afternoon, the jewellers' body announced another hike of Tk10,906 per bhori, taking the total increase for the day to Tk16,330. Following the two revisions, the price of 22-carat gold has been set at Tk262,090 per bhori, effective immediately. Bajus said the latest price adjustment was made considering the overall market situation after an increase in the price of tejabi gold (pure gold) in the local market. Under the new rates, 21-carat gold will cost Tk250,193 per bhori, 18-carat gold Tk214,443, while gold under the traditional method has been fixed at Tk175,485 per bhori. In addition to the selling price, buyers will have to pay a 5% government-imposed VAT and a minimum 6% making charge set by Bajus. The making charge may vary depending on the design and quality of jewellery. Just a day earlier, on Monday, Bajus had reduced gold prices twice, bringing the price of 22-carat gold down to Tk245,760 per bhori. With the latest hike, gold prices have been adjusted 24 times so far this year, raised 16 times and reduced eight times. Alongside gold, silver prices were also revised. The price of 22-carat silver has been fixed at Tk6,532 per bhori after a reduction of Tk175. The new rates set 21-carat silver at Tk6,240, 18-carat at Tk5,365, and traditional silver at Tk4,024 per bhori. This marks the 16th adjustment of silver prices this year, with prices increased 10 times and reduced six times.

The barriers include the lease term of land under the Bepza, how the loans taken from various banks and financial institutions during the Bscic period be settled, and how new charges are determined for the operation of the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP). Stakeholders involved in the industry said that several tannery owners in Savar have huge outstanding debts, amounting one thousand to one and a half thousand crore taka. Before handing over to the industrial park Bepza, the tannery owners demanded special rescheduling benefits, including waiver of interest on these loans. Ashik Chowdhury, executive chairman of Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (Beza) and the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (Bida), told The Business Standard, \"A roadmap for the Savar Leather Industrial City has been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Industries after discussions with stakeholders. Now, the Ministry of Industries will make the final decision on this matter.\" Recently, the high-powered committee, formed by the government to prepare a roadmap regarding the control of the industrial park, has submitted a report with some recommendations. Eid brings no relief as exports slump, tariff pressures mount on tanners The Savar Industrial Park was developed on 199.40 acres of land as part of a government initiative to relocate tanneries from Hazaribagh and curb environmental pollution, setting up a CETP on 17.30-acre of land with sewage treatment plants and dumping yards to treat 25,000 cubic metres of waste. The construction work of the project was scheduled to be completed in 2005 after beginning two years back. However, the deadline was extended 12 times, and costs increased from Tk175 crore to Tk1,015 crore before it was formally completed in 2021. According to sources at the government-formed committee, the CETP has been unable to treat more than 15,000 cubic metres of effluent per day due to shortages of skilled personnel and technical expertise. Solid waste management is another major concern, with large volumes of leather waste contributing to environmental pollution and loss of potential economic value. To address these issues, the committee headed by Major General (retd) Md Nazrul Islam, executive member of Bepza, was formed in August last year. Tk10cr 'safe landfill' project aims to curb Savar tannery pollution Speaking to TBS, he said the most critical issue is the heavy debt burden on tannery units as many operators borrowed heavily but failed to achieve viable production, raising difficult questions about how the government should deal with liabilities of non-operational units. Highlighting the importance of a strong and effective management structure, he said that a strong body is badly needed to govern such the estate. Acknowledging complexities in completing the process, a committee member said balancing the interests of tannery owners, finished leather producers, and regulatory bodies are challenging, particularly given the unresolved debt and liability issues. Leather Development Forum (LDF) Coordinator Taherul Islam said the Bepza management could significantly increase effluent treatment costs, potentially raising CETP charges from the current Tk40–60 per cubic metre to more than Tk200 per cubic metre. Such an increase, he warned, would be commercially unviable for most tannery operators and highlighted legal complications arising from differences in land-leasing policies. While Bscic provides 99-year lease deeds, Bepza generally offers 30-year rental agreements, which could create contractual and legal hurdles during any transition, he said. Ferdaus Ara Begum, chief executive officer of Business Initiative Leading Development (BUILD), described the process as a positive step, citing Bepza's track record in managing export processing zones in Dhaka, Cumilla, and other regions. She said Bepza is widely regarded as one of Bangladesh's most successful institutions, particularly in operating CETPs, and its experience could improve effluent management at Savar. However, the BUILD chief executive cautioned that several structural and contractual issues need to be resolved. Tannery workers decry wage non-implementation a year after declaration Bscic Chairman Md Saiful Islam said the estate will be governed according to government decisions based on the committee's recommendations. Md. Shakawat Ullah, senior vice chairman of the Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA), told TBS that tannery owners have taken a 99-year lease from the BSCIC to construct facilities, and currently, about 141 units are in production there. \"During a discussion with us, it was informed that the industrial city will be considered a specialised industrial area and the industrial units will operate under the existing rules and regulations of Bscic. However, matters such as CETP and waste management may be handled through separate arrangements, for which a prescribed fee will be collected from the industrial owners,\" he claimed. With the transfer of management, clarity is needed on whether this supply system, NBR-related issues, he said. Regarding the loan-related challenges, Shakwat said that since 2017, many tannery owners have been unable to run their businesses normally, causing a huge burden of loans and interest. He said that these issues have also been included in the set of recommendations and that later, discussions with the Ministry of Finance could be held to find solutions.

{"title": "IMF cautions Bangladesh against unsecured liquidity support to weak banks", "body": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned Bangladesh against providing unsecured liquidity injections to weak banks, stressing the need for a tight monetary policy stance and credible banking sector reforms to restore financial stability. The caution came as the IMF Executive Board concluded its 2025 Article IV Consultation with Bangladesh on Monday (26 January), with the authorities consenting to the publication of the staff report, according to a statement released yesterday (30 January). The IMF noted that Bangladesh's economic growth has slowed in recent years while inflation has remained elevated. GDP growth fell to 3.7% in FY25 from 4.2% in FY24 and 5.8% in FY23, reflecting production disruptions during the 2024 uprising, a tighter policy mix and weak investment. Inflation eased from double-digit levels earlier in FY25 but remained high at 8.2% year-on-year in October. IMF observed that Bangladesh's tax revenue-to-GDP ratio declined sharply in FY25, although the fiscal deficit was contained due to under-execution of capital and social spending. Foreign exchange reserves have started to recover, supported by improvements in the current account balance. Looking ahead, the IMF projected a gradual economic recovery, provided reforms are implemented. Growth is expected to rebound to 4.7% in FY26 and rise to around 6% over the medium term, supported by higher revenue mobilisation and measures to address financial sector weaknesses. Inflation, however, is projected to remain elevated at 8.9% in FY26 before easing to about 6% in FY27. Executive directors acknowledged the interim authorities' efforts to stabilise the economy following the 2024 uprising and ahead of national elections. However, they warned that Bangladesh continues to face mounting macroeconomic and financial challenges, including weak revenue mobilisation, banking sector vulnerabilities, incomplete implementation of the new exchange rate framework and persistently high inflation. Directors noted uneven programme performance and said decisive and sustained policy actions would be required to restore macroeconomic and financial stability. They stressed that full ownership of the reform programme by the next administration would be critical, alongside early engagement with IMF staff and efforts to secure stakeholder support. On the banking sector, the IMF highlighted the urgent need for a credible reform strategy aligned with international standards. Directors said such a strategy should include clear estimates of undercapitalisation, define the scope of fiscal support and outline legally robust restructuring and resolution plans. They encouraged the authorities to conduct asset quality reviews for all systemic and state-owned banks, strengthen risk-based supervision and improve governance and balance sheet transparency. In this context, the IMF cautioned against unsecured liquidity injections into weak banks, warning that such measures could undermine financial stability. The IMF also stressed that maintaining a tight policy mix remains necessary to continue rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and reducing inflation. Directors stressed the importance of full and consistent implementation of exchange rate reforms, along with greater exchange rate flexibility. Monetary policy, they said, should remain appropriately tight until inflation is firmly on a downward trajectory, while efforts to modernise the monetary policy framework should continue. On fiscal policy, directors urged ambitious reforms to boost revenue. They encouraged bold tax policy measures, simplification of the tax system and stronger tax administration and compliance. The IMF also underscored the need to rationalise subsidies, prioritise growth-enhancing investment and improve public financial and investment management, while strengthening social safety nets to support inclusive growth. The institution further noted that improving the financial viability of energy sector state-owned enterprises would be important for reducing fiscal risks. Beyond macroeconomic management, the IMF stressed the importance of comprehensive structural reforms as Bangladesh prepares to graduate from least developed country status. Directors highlighted the need to enhance governance and transparency, strengthen anti-corruption and AML/CFT frameworks and safeguard central bank autonomy. They also supported policies aimed at job creation, particularly for young people, export diversification and continued improvements in macroeconomic statistics. The IMF said continued implementation of reforms under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility arrangement could help Bangladesh build climate resilience and mobilise climate finance.

{"title": "Trump administration to soon end audit deal underpinning Chinese listings in US", "body": "The Trump administration plans to soon scrap a 2013 agreement between US and Chinese auditing authorities, a senior State Department official said, a move that could foreshadow a broader crackdown on US-listed Chinese firms under fire for sidestepping American disclosure rules. The deal, which set up a process for a US auditing watchdog to seek documents in enforcement cases against Chinese auditors, was initially welcomed as a breakthrough in US efforts to gain access to closely guarded Chinese financial information and bestowed a mark of legitimacy on Chinese regulators. But the watchdog, known as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), has long complained of China's failure to grant requests, meaning scant insight into audits of Chinese firms that trade on US exchanges. The lack of transparency has prompted administration officials to lay the groundwork to exit the deal soon, according to Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, in a sign the PCAOB will give up on efforts to secure information from the Chinese. \"The action is imminent,\" Krach said on Monday in an emailed response to questions. \"This is a National Security issue because we cannot continue to afford to put American shareholders at risk, to put American companies at a disadvantage and allow our preeminence of being the gold standard for financial markets to erode.\" One other administration official and three former White House officials said terminating the memorandum of understanding was under consideration, adding that the White House was involved with the discussions. The White House declined to comment, while the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the PCAOB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It is not clear when or how the administration would revoke the agreement, which requires 30-day notice by either party, and its termination would not directly threaten the listed status of Chinese companies that trade on US exchanges. Among some of the bigger Chinese companies trading in the United States are Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc. But discussions about revoking it are a sign of growing frustration by US authorities over a lack of disclosure by Chinese companies widely held by US investors that could lead to a more direct crackdown. It also comes amid rising US-China tensions over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus and its move to curb freedoms in Hong Kong. In May, the administration successfully pressured an independent board that oversees a $40 billion international pension fund for federal employees to halt plans to track an index that includes Chinese companies, citing \"risks to investors resulting from inadequate investor disclosures and protections under Chinese law.\" In early June, President Donald Trump assigned a group of officials including Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the PCAOB, to recommend measures within 60 days to protect U.S investors \"from the failure of the Chinese government to allow PCAOB-registered audit firms to comply with United States securities laws.\" Last week, PCAOB Chairman William Duhnke said he saw \"no prospects\" of being able to properly do its job overseeing disclosures and preventing accounting fraud in China. Pressure is also mounting from Congress, with the Republican-led Senate passing a bill that, if approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives and signed into law, would bar securities of any foreign company from being listed on any US securities exchange if it has failed to comply with the PCAOB's audits for three years in a row. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hardliner, said it was \"long overdue\" for the administration to take \"decisive action\" on the issue as the Senate has. \"In addition to terminating this MOU, which allows Chinese companies to openly defy US laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability, we must address the Chinese Communist Party's exploitation of US capital markets, which is a clear and ongoing risk to US economic and national security,\" he said in a statement to Reuters. But some US investors have raised concerns that such moves by Congress could shut them out of high-yield investment opportunities that would remain open to investors in other countries. China itself may have helped prompt the latest campaign by Washington to flex its muscle on audits by amending a securities law in March to ban any Chinese person from sharing any securities-related document with regulators overseas without approval from the securities regulatory authority under the state council. But the limits of the MOU were visible from long before, according to industry figures. The agreement, which is not legally binding, does not allow the PCAOB to conduct inspections of Chinese accounting firms and explicitly permits each side to deny document requests if they violate domestic law or the national interest. \"The MOU represents a gaping hole in US investor protections, while providing the framework for systemic Chinese fraud,\" said Kyle Bass, a hedge fund manager and vocal critic of China. \"It's unconscionable that the United States continues to allow Chinese companies raising trillions of dollars from US investors to avoid complying with basic US securities and audit standards.\" US-China / US-China Trade Deal", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/global-economy/trump-administration-soon-end-audit-deal-underpinning-chinese-listings-us", "date": "2020-07-14T09:35:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 14 July, 2020, 09:35 am Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 09:40 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 843, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:20:19.215822"}

{"title": "The conundrum of English-Medium tutoring", "body": "By the time Kazi Farhan Mahi turned 19, he was earning more than many entry-level professionals in Dhaka. He had not planned it that way. Teaching was not something he had set out to do, nor had he imagined it as a long-term path at the time. It began when he was 17, at a moment when continuing his own education depended on his ability to manage money independently. English-medium education in Bangladesh is expensive, and his family was then going through a financial crisis. With no work experience and still a student himself, tutoring was the only option available. Like many students across different education streams, he turned to private tuition out of necessity. What began as a temporary solution gradually became something long-term. Mahi started out with home tuition and by assisting teachers at coaching centres. Years later, he is now the Head of Sections, from Middle Years to A Levels, at Reverie School. The distance between those two points appears neat when stated plainly, but the path was far from smooth. After completing his A Levels, Mahi planned to study abroad. The funding did not come through, and he had to continue his education in Bangladesh. That came with its own complications. \"It's tough to get into public universities from an English-medium background,\" he says. \"So I had to look at private universities. Again, I needed money to continue my education, because private universities cost more.\" Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel By then, tutoring was already part of his life. One of his former teachers suggested that he apply to schools. \"I thought if I joined a school, I'd be able to connect with more students,\" he said. He later began teaching at a school. Since then, his life has been split between schools, private tuition and coaching centres. He does not regret that choice. \"I really enjoy teaching,\" he said. \"When I interact with my students and see their achievements, it gives a different kind of joy.\" For him, the work has remained meaningful. For others, it does not last as long. Nylah Shah, a former O/A Level English teacher, entered the same world for similar reasons. She began tutoring at the age of fifteen. \"I was a kid myself when I started tutoring,\" she says. After a few years, she began teaching at a school. Between 2015 and 2020, she worked at four English-medium schools. Alongside this, she took home tuition and taught at private coaching centres in Dhanmondi, and later in Gulshan. \"What stayed constant through all those years was coaching,\" she said. \"When you teach in a school, students get to know you. They trust you with their education.\" That trust travels easily from classrooms to coaching centres and into private homes. After 2020, Nylah shifted to online teaching. In early 2025, she left the profession altogether, despite the income. Taken together, stories like Mahi's and Nylah's point to a much larger structure that runs informally alongside formal education. A vast private tuition and coaching culture has grown around English-medium education, fuelled by exam pressure, parental anxiety and the limitations of schools themselves. From the outside, it can be difficult to see. There are no official figures, no reliable data. But the scale becomes apparent once you look at the number of students involved and the fees being charged. According to Mahi, income in this space depends entirely on how much physical and mental effort someone is willing to put in. \"You can earn anywhere from Tk90,000 to Tk10 or 12 lakh per month. I even know people running coaching centres whose monthly income is Tk30 to 32 lakh,\" he said. Since this is not a fixed profession with a formal salary structure, it is closer to piecework, where time, energy and reputation translate directly into cash. Your income depends on how much physical and mental effort you can give. After 35 or 40, you can't continue the way you did in your 20s. That's why many people eventually switch careers. Kazi Farhan Mahi, Tutor Several factors have contributed to the growth of this system. One of these is the flexibility of the exam registration process. English-medium students can register for O and A Level exams either through schools or privately. For many, that choice becomes strategic. Dhrupadi Auditi, an A Level student, explains how this works in practice. \"After a certain stage at English-medium schools, apart from the really good, well-known ones, the education isn't that strong,\" she said. Being registered through a school still matters, especially as universities tend to prioritise institutional candidates. But cost and flexibility often push students in another direction. \"Some students prefer sitting independently for exams,\" she said. \"Those who attend school regularly also get tuition and coaching, but students who sit privately definitely rely more on private tutors and informal coaching centres. I myself, for my O Level exams, did not attend any school or formal institution, but for the exams I registered under Academia School.\" Exam registration fees are already high. When those costs are added to school tuition, along with coaching and private tutoring, education becomes unaffordable for many families. \"If schools can't meet the required needs of students, why wouldn't they seek private tuition?\" Dhrupadi asks. \"Nobody wants to sit and retake again and again, paying so much money.\" This demand feeds a parallel system. In most cases, tutors enter it for financial reasons—covering education costs, becoming independent, or supporting their family. There are exceptions. \"I have a few students who tutor just for the process,\" Mahi said. \"They enjoy teaching.\" But enjoyment alone rarely sustains the work. Usually, it starts with one-on-one tuition. As demand grows, tutors move into coaching. Often, a few teachers rent a space together—one or two rooms, sometimes an entire floor—and divide it based on availability and affordability. That is how many coaching centres begin. To keep the cycle going, tutors also try to work in schools. Schools offer visibility. Coaching centres offer volume and income. Home tuition offers flexibility. Most juggle all three. Fees vary sharply by location. English-medium tuition is already more expensive than other systems, for reasons that include international curricula and specialised instruction. Even within this tuition culture, there are differences. \"A private tuition that costs eight to ten thousand in the Dhanmondi area becomes fifteen to eighteen thousand in Gulshan,\" Mahi said. Coaching fees shift in the same way, shaped by neighbourhoods and the economic background of families. The money, of course, is good. The cost, however, can be exhausting. Balancing school jobs, coaching classes, home tuition and personal studies drains people quickly—especially when they start young. \"For a long time, I was doing everything at once,\" Nylah said. \"I was teaching in a school, teaching at a coaching centre, and I was a student myself. At one point I thought, enough. I need rest.\" Beyond fatigue, there is also stagnation. \"When you start, you learn a lot,\" she said. \"But after a few years, you realise there isn't much scope to grow. I was doing the same thing over and over again. I was earning well, but I felt stuck. It didn't require learning new things anymore. I felt like I had more to offer through my work than repeating the same lessons.\" Mahi sees the limits too. \"Your income depends on how much physical and mental effort you can give,\" he said. \"After 35 or 40, you can't continue the way you did in your 20s. That's why many people eventually switch careers.\" Social pressure plays a role as well. Traditional jobs still carry a certain legitimacy, even when they pay less. But switching is not that simple. Entry-level formal jobs rarely offer high pay. For someone used to earning three or four lakh a month, stepping into a position that pays one lakh, or less, requires sacrifice. Lifestyle, responsibilities and expectations all come into question. In the end, it comes down to priorities. Teachers like Mahi, who still enjoy the work and are willing to continue, stay. Others, like Nylah, reach a point where the cost outweighs the return and choose to leave. English-medium education in Bangladesh is expensive, and his family was then going through a financial crisis. With no work experience and still a student himself, tutoring was the only option available. Like many students across different education streams, he turned to private tuition out of necessity. What began as a temporary solution gradually became something long-term. Mahi started out with home tuition and by assisting teachers at coaching centres. Years later, he is now the Head of Sections, from Middle Years to A Levels, at Reverie School. The distance between those two points appears neat when stated plainly, but the path was far from smooth. After completing his A Levels, Mahi planned to study abroad. The funding did not come through, and he had to continue his education in Bangladesh. That came with its own complications. \"It's tough to get into public universities from an English-medium background,\" he says. \"So I had to look at private universities. Again, I needed money to continue my education, because private universities cost more.\" By then, tutoring was already part of his life. One of his former teachers suggested that he apply to schools. \"I thought if I joined a school, I'd be able to connect with more students,\" he said. He later began teaching at a school. Since then, his life has been split between schools, private tuition and coaching centres. He does not regret that choice. \"I really enjoy teaching,\" he said. \"When I interact with my students and see their achievements, it gives a different kind of joy.\" For him, the work has remained meaningful.

The planemaker, which has now been striving to get its once best-selling MAX planes back in the air for more than a year after two fatal crashes led to its grounding, said airlines and leasing companies canceled another 60 orders for the jet last month. Deliveries in the first half of the year also sank by 71 percent to just 70 planes as customers canceled or deferred shipments due to the collapse in air travel from coronavirus-led travel restrictions. Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because airlines pay most of the purchase price when they actually receive the aircraft. Boeing said it handed over 10 aircraft in June, up from four planes in May, and six jets in April. The company's June deliveries include one 747, one 777, one KC-46 tanker, two 767 freighters, two P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and three 787s. The June cancellations came from aircraft-leasing firms, including US-based Aviation Capital, Dublin-based Avolon, and Singapore's BOC Aviation, which respectively scrubbed 5, 17 and 30 orders for the 737 MAX. Romanian carrier Blue Air also canceled six 737 MAX orders, with another two 737 MAX orders halted by unidentified customers. On the plus side, FedEx Corp booked an order for a 767 freighter, taking Boeing's gross orders for the year to 59 planes as of the end of June.

Fifty-one percent of fatal drowning victims in Commonwealth countries were children and adolescents. Bangladesh had the highest drowning rate among the Commonwealth countries in Asia. India, Bangladesh and Pakistan accounted for 78 percent of estimated drowning fatalities within the Commonwealth. The Royal Life Saving Society offered the insight in its fact sheet \"Fatal Drowning in Commonwealth Countries\" launched in July 2020. \"More than 300 people die from drowning each day in the Commonwealth. And low and middle-income countries are the most vulnerable ones,\" said the Royal Life Saving Society Drowning Prevention Director and also the International Drowning Research Centre-Bangladesh of CIPRB Director Dr Aminur Rahman. \"Drowning is preventable even in these countries. Now is the time for the Commonwealth nations to take actions to prevent these unnecessary deaths.\" The Royal Life Saving Society's fact sheet provides a detailed analysis of fatal drowning across the Commonwealth with additional information on both strategic, practical and achievable preventative measures. It identifies drowning as a serious health issue and highlights proactive prevention measures. Also, the fact sheet data provides a better understanding of the mortality burden in the Commonwealth countries. \"We call upon government agencies and ministries to provide necessary support in implementing the preventable measures outlined in the fact sheet to reduce the loss of lives to drowning,\" said Professor AKM Fazlur Rahman, executive director of CIPRB (Centre for Injury Prevention and Research Bangladesh) – a Royal Life Saving Society member. The Royal Life Saving Society President HRH Prince Michael of Kent GCVO said, \"Over the last year, the Royal Life Saving Society has undertaken a vital piece of work to report the number of deaths by drowning in the Commonwealth. \"There is a real concern that the loss of lives might be much higher in many Commonwealth nations, given that not all deaths by drowning are recorded accurately, or even at all. The figures, we do have, tell us that the number of lives lost is extremely high,\" he added.

{"title": "South Korea court rejects US extradition request for child porn network operator", "body": "A South Korean court on Monday refused an extradition request by US law enforcement authorities for a man convicted of running a South Korea-based dark web child pornography site that sold videos for digital cash around the world. The man, Son Jong-woo, the site's operator, completed an 18-month sentence for violating South Korean child protection and information laws in April but has remained in custody after he was also indicted on US federal charges in Washington. The Seoul High Court said in its ruling that it had refused the extradition request because sending him to the United States could hamper South Korean investigations into sexually exploitive content, Yonhap news agency reported. The court said the ruling should not be interpreted as exonerating Son, and that he should actively cooperate with investigators and face proper punishment, according to Yonhap. Reuters was no able to find contact information for Son's lawyer. Officials said last year they had arrested at least 338 people in 12 countries linked to the network, which they described as one of the largest child pornography operations they had encountered.

{"title": "Taiwan opens office to help people fleeing Hong Kong after China passes new security law", "body": "Taiwan opened an office on Wednesday to help people fleeing Hong Kong after China imposed new national security laws in the city, with a senior minister saying Taiwan would continue to support freedom and democracy in the Hong Kong. The contentious law which came into force on Wednesday will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, heralding a more authoritarian era for the Asian financial hub. Anti-government protests in Hong Kong have won widespread and cross-party support in democratic and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, where the laws have been widely condemned. Some 200 Hong Kongers have already fled to the island since pro-democracy demonstrations began last year, rights groups say. President Tsai Ing-wen in May became the first government leader anywhere to pledge measures to help Hong Kong people who leave due to what they see as tightening Chinese controls. Speaking at the opening of the office in downtown Taipei, Chen Ming-tong, the head of Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, said the facility shows their determination to aid Hong Kongers. \"This is an important milestone for the government to further support democracy and freedom in Hong Kong,\" Chen said. Taiwan shares with the protesters a deep antipathy for Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Chen warned Beijing was seeking to target people in other countries with the law. \"This not only targets residents in Hong Kong. It's also an order issued by the Celestial Empire to people all over the world,\" he added, referring to China's government. The new laws will apply to permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong. Beijing denies stifling Hong Kong's freedoms and has condemned Taiwan's plans to help Hong Kongers. Late Tuesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the new law would \"cut off the black hand\" of Taiwan's meddling in Hong Kong. The office opened on the sensitive anniversary of the return of Hong Kong, a former British colony, to Chinese rule in 1997. Chen declined to say how many people they expect to come, or how many applications they had received so far. Taipei-based diplomatic sources have said they expect only the most radical and less well-off Hong Kongers to come to Taiwan, with most others preferring to go to Western countries like Canada, Britain and the United States. Chen's deputy, Chiu Chui-Cheng, said about two dozen people will work in the new office and that they had already received \"many calls\". Those who come to Taiwan will need to do so legally, and the office has at least 20 hotlines to field enquiries, Chiu added. Necessary assistance will be given, including accommodation, he said.

Mujibul Haque, a landlord in Kalabagan, broke three of his tenant's rooms. The other landlord owned a student's hostel, his identity could not be known. Sazib Mia, one of the victims and the plaintiff of one case told The Business Standard that eight students left their rooms and went to their village homes on March 20 as their educational institutions were closed due to the Coronavirus situation. \"We could not come back because of the situation across the country. The landlord called us last month for the due rent of three months.

{"title": "Global clothing suppliers vocal against unethical purchasing practices", "body": "Global apparel suppliers have started to raise their voice against unethical cancellation and holding up of orders by retailers and buyers amid the coronavirus crisis. As part of this move, International Apparel Federation (IAF) Secretary General Matthijs Crietee held a virtual meeting with Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) Director Miran Ali, and a representative of the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) on Wednesday. A day ago, Crietee also discussed the issue with Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) Director Fazlee Shamim Ehsan. Miran Ali and Fazlee Shamim Ehsan represent their respective organisations – the BGMEA and the BKMEA – at the Sustainable Textile of Asian Region (STAR) Network. Sources said such discussions will continue in order to find out a solution to the current issues. The STAR Network, a platform of apparel exporters in Asia, has also raised its voice against unethical buying practices by global buyers. Nine textile and garment business associations from six Asian countries are members of the STAR Network. The countries are Bangladesh, China, Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and Vietnam. \"We have had discussions about setting up a study group to analyse the overall situation,\" said Miran Ali, director of the BGMEA. Apparel exporters want to make STAR Network a multi-county platform, Miran said, adding that if any single country raises its voice against global buyers' buying practices, its businesses might be affected; but establishing a regional platform would strengthen them to raise their voice against force majeure. Amid the pandemic, the STAR Network earlier urged the global brands, retailers and traders to follow responsible purchasing practices amid the Covid-19 crisis. The buyers have been asking for maintaining ethical practices and compliance in the RMG industry for long, but most of them are not following the terms of RMG purchasing orders during the pandemic, said Fazlee Shamim Ehsan, also a director at the IAF, an association that has operations in 60 countries. Most of them are not paying their suppliers as per their contract, putting pressure for discounts and offering devalued prices in new orders, he added. \"We are discussing among the members to take initiative to prevent such unethical practices,\" said Ehsan. Asking for anonymity, one the largest denim textile factory owners shared a bitter experience with The Business Standard. He said, \"A brand asked us to join an online bidding offering us a price at least 20 percent below the costing price of fabrics. How could we take such orders?\" \"In normal times, most representatives of such buyers used to confirm an order by calling me on telephone after placing the order, however, the pandemic has changed their behaviour.\" \"Now they call us to join online biddings to get a small quantity of order,\" he added. The denim textile has been supplying over 60 million yards of fabrics with a reputation for over a decade. The textile makers also having nominations from about 20 leading retailers include Inditex, H&M, Walmart, Levi's and M&S. \"Now we textile millers, garment makers and accessories suppliers are looking to run our units with affordable prices instead of making any profit,\" said the textile miller. He, however, expressed his hope for a better future if they can survive the next six months as he expects the pandemic situation will improve within this time. Another leading garment exporter alleged that almost every buyer is now putting tremendous pressure on suppliers to reduce prices of products. As a result, they have been forced to leave some Procurement Orders (PO), he added. According to the BGMEA, about $2.97 billion worth of apparel items orders have been cancelled and withheld after the Covid-19 outbreak. Currently, most factories are running with 55 to 60 percent production capacity. Over 400 garment factories have been shut down because of a lack of orders.

No casualties have been reported, the agency said. There have been several explosions and fires around Iranian military, nuclear and industrial facilities since late June, including a fire at Iran's underground Natanz nuclear facility on July 2. Natanz is the centrepiece of Iran's enrichment programme, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes. Western intelligence agencies and the UN's nuclear watchdog (IAEA) believe it had a coordinated, clandestine nuclear arms programme that it halted in 2003. Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons. Iran's top security body said on July 3 that the cause of the Natanz fire had been determined but would be announced at a later time. Some Iranian officials have said it may have been cyber sabotage and one of them warned that Tehran would retaliate against any country carrying out such attacks. In an article in early July, state news agency IRNA addressed what it called the possibility of sabotage by enemies such as Israel and the United States, although it stopped short of accusing either directly.

Nazmus Sakib served as joint member secretary of the NLA but did not hold any position within the NCP. The NLA issued the show-cause notice yesterday (1 February) over Sakib's alleged statements contrary to organisational discipline and decorum. The notice said Sakib had been temporarily relieved of his duties and asked him to submit a written explanation within three working days as to why he should not be permanently expelled. Speaking to The Business Standard tonight, Sakib confirmed receiving the show-cause notice. \"I will submit my response within the stipulated time. Essentially, I was served the notice because of my statements against Jamaat,\" he said. An advocate from the platform said Sakib regularly speaks against Jamaat and Shibir on television talk shows. \"Recently, he also referred to [Ducsu VP] Shadik Kayem as 'rude' in a public statement. These could be among the reasons for issuing the show-cause notice,\" the lawyer added. However, another female advocate of the platform told The Business Standard that Sakib's behaviour has been \"highly undisciplined.\" She alleged that he routinely harassed female colleagues and showed little regard for organisational norms. \"Several female lawyers have lodged complaints against him for misconduct. That could be why the notice was issued,\" she said. Meanwhile, the NLA has announced the formation of an investigation subcommittee to resolve the disciplinary matter, appointing Advocate Mostafa Azgar Sharifi as its head. Sharifi told The Business Standard that the show-cause notice was issued due to Sakib's overall conduct within the organisation. \"We will not provide details at this stage. You will be informed once the matter is resolved,\" he said. The NLA was launched on 9 November last year with a 75-member committee.

The movement has also signalled its intention to request a $500 billion line of credit from the US Treasury to \"support the transition to a free and independent Alberta,\" according to a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, by one of its leaders, reports CNN. The Alberta Prosperity Project, which advocates a referendum on secession, has reportedly met US State Department officials three times since April 2025. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has urged the United States to \"respect Canadian sovereignty,\" following reports in the Financial Times. However, a White House spokesperson downplayed any official involvement, saying, \"Administration officials meet with a number of civil society groups. No support or commitments were conveyed.\" Proponents of Alberta independence argue that federal policies on climate and taxation disadvantage the province and ignore its conservative values. Michael Solberg, former adviser in prime minister Stephen Harper's government, said, \"Western alienation has existed since confederation.\" \"Support for secession tends to rise when Albertans feel Ottawa is making decisions that directly harm their way of life,\" he added. Federal COVID-19 lockdowns and over a decade of Liberal leadership have intensified grievances. In response, the Alberta legislature passed a law in 2025 making it easier to organise a referendum on independence. However, the movement remains largely driven by online activism and outspoken individuals rather than a structured political campaign. No separatist parties currently hold seats in the provincial legislature. We look forward to meeting with US Treasury officials next month to discuss our feasibility study regarding a 500 Billion USD line of credit to support the transition to a free and independent Alberta. https://t.co/SsWmlwnPU6— Jeffrey Rath (@JeffreyRWRath) January 23, 2026 Trump's influence Supporters have embraced Trump as a symbol of pro-oil conservatism. Some advocate full independence, while others suggest Alberta could become the 51st US state. A highway billboard between Calgary and Edmonton, funded by a group calling itself \"Canadians for the 51st State,\" urged residents to tell Alberta Premier Danielle Smith to \"Join the USA!\" alongside an image of her shaking hands with Trump. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, \"They [Albertans] have great resources. They are very independent people. People want sovereignty. They want what the US has got.\" He also added that Canada may not allow Alberta to build an oil pipeline to the Pacific and suggested the US should consider supporting the province's ambitions. Experts predict a referendum may occur this year, yet public support remains limited. A January 2026 poll by Pollara Strategic Insights found only 19% of Albertans favour secession. Lori Williams, political science professor at Mount Royal University, noted, \"Many who support a referendum are symbolic separatists; they want to send a message to Ottawa, not necessarily break away.\" Indigenous communities have voiced strong opposition, prompting legislation that guarantees treaty rights regardless of the referendum outcome. Solberg warns: \"Even if a referendum passes, the process would be extraordinarily complex and destabilising. The legal and economic risks remain immense.\" Premier Smith has described the grievances as \"legitimate\" but does not endorse secession. As Alberta debates its future, Canada faces the challenge of balancing provincial autonomy with national unity while navigating an increasingly contentious relationship with the US. Alberta, a western province of roughly 5 million people, is home to major oil sands producing about 84% of Canada's crude oil. Its economy also relies heavily on agriculture. Often called the \"energy province,\" Alberta has long championed conservative politics, although its urban centres, Calgary and Edmonton, lean more progressive. Premier Danielle Smith has cultivated ties with former US President Donald Trump and other Republican figures, visiting Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in January 2025. \"Alberta has always valued strong economic partnerships, and we are open to international engagement,\" Smith said during a press briefing last year. Leaders in other provinces, by contrast, have united in opposition to Trump's tariffs and threats, seeking to present a united Canadian front.

{"title": "Interoperability in Bangladesh: The Stakes, the setbacks, and the way ahead", "body": "Interoperability is widely acknowledged as one of the most powerful enablers of digital finance. When customers can send, receive, and use money across various providers—such as banks, payment system providers, wallets, and cards—the payments ecosystem becomes faster, more convenient, and potentially cheaper. The World Bank and CPMI's Principles for Financial Inclusion (PAFI) emphasise that interoperability increases competition, reduces fixed infrastructure costs, enables economies of scale, and significantly enhances customer convenience. Globally, interoperable systems—from India's UPI to Tanzania's mobile-money rails—have demonstrated that shared infrastructure significantly increases transaction volumes, lowers marginal costs, and fosters innovation. Interoperability also strengthens merchant acceptance and makes digital ecosystems \"sticky\", reducing customer dropout, increasing digital uptake, and improving trust. Yet Bangladesh did not have interoperability for years, and relied on bilateral arrangements Despite having one of the world's most dynamic mobile-money sectors, Bangladesh operated without true interoperability for more than a decade. Before 2019, the market relied heavily on bilateral arrangements such as bank-to-wallet transfers through individualised agreements (e.g. BRAC–Rocket partnerships), card-to-wallet top-ups using specific bilateral integrations (e.g. bKash–Mastercard), and wallet-to-wallet transactions between select partner providers, rather than across the whole ecosystem. This bilateral approach had three consequences: a) high integration costs for each new partnership; b) no uniform pricing, leading to market distortion; c) digital silos, where each large provider captured its own customer base and ecosystem. Given the dominance of leading MFS providers such as bKash, Nagad and Rocket—and the associated float income, agent-network investments, and branding advantages—there was little commercial incentive for them to open up to competitors voluntarily. How things have changed To address these structural barriers, the UK-funded Business Finance for the Poor in Bangladesh (BFP-B) programme undertook extensive technical work on interoperability from 2017 to 2020. BFP-B concluded that Bangladesh could unlock enormous value if it shifted from bilateral, provider-led integrations to a switch-based, rules-driven interoperable ecosystem under Bangladesh Bank. Under the BFP-B programme, MSC developed a comprehensive framework to support the Bangladesh Bank in the rollout of interoperable digital financial services. The operational guidelines defined key use cases—including wallet-to-wallet, bank-to-wallet, card-to-wallet, PSP-to-wallet, and merchant payments—and outlined a phased, switch-based implementation sequence with real-time settlement through the National Payment Switch Bangladesh (NPSB). These guidelines were comprehensive, detailed, and technically robust—yet adoption was limited at the time for various reasons, including a lack of provider participation. After more than five years, Bangladesh Bank has enabled interoperability through NPSB Recently, Bangladesh Bank formally enabled account-to-account interoperability through NPSB, updating the regulatory framework to include banks, mobile financial services, microfinance institutions, and payment service operators. The switch now supports real-time clearing and multi-party settlement. This marks a significant regulatory commitment as NPSB rules are upgraded, settlement processes standardised, and technical processes established for providers to follow. Despite regulatory readiness, the adoption of interoperability through NPSB has lagged. Providers question the commercial benefits as they face high integration and transition costs. They also argue that current interchange and fee structures do not offset lost float income and ongoing agent commissions, particularly for high-volume players with large agent networks. Many still doubt NPSB's uptime, message integrity, fraud controls, and real-time-payments performance, and may hesitate to integrate until reliability at scale is demonstrated. Integrating with the central switch also requires significant technological upgrades, testing, and reconciliation changes, which weigh heavily on smaller or legacy institutions. Unresolved questions on SLAs, liability, AML/CFT, and interoperable pricing can further delay decisions and the onboarding of providers onto NPSB. What can now be done to resolve concerns and bring large providers on board? For successful uptake of interoperability, four specific actions—based on our experience—are necessary: Reset the commercial model through a structured, transparent interchange framework: A well-designed pricing structure is key to successful interoperability. It must incentivise players to cover the costs of managing payment infrastructure, fraud prevention, and customer management and servicing. In Bangladesh, major players will also consider the impact on float income, transactional revenues, and distribution expenses before fully embracing interoperability. Conversely, customers generally expect little to no cost for digital payments, as cash is considered \"free\". To address this, Bangladesh Bank may consider: Publishing a long-term roadmap or vision, to be reviewed annually Establishing a high-powered steering group comprising major players as well as smaller players and think-tanks to determine the fee and incentive structure Allowing temporary transition incentives for providers with large distribution networks This mirrors strategies from Brazil (PIX pricing standards) and Pakistan (regulated 1Link pricing). Implement a formal phase-wise onboarding model with readiness audits A five-phase rollout sequence is recommended to give providers adequate time to prepare and integrate their systems, ensuring a steady adoption of interoperability. This phased approach is akin to building a payment highway: Phase 1 starts by connecting the two biggest cities (MFS wallets), where traffic is densest. Phase 2 connects these cities to the national rail network (banks), already established on the switch. Subsequent phases handle smaller connections (cards, PSPs) and specialised infrastructure (merchants/QR codes), ensuring the system prioritises high-volume traffic before being overwhelmed by complexity. Bangladesh Bank can also adopt a readiness-audit model similar to Kenya's PesaLink, ensuring that each provider meets minimum requirements such as real-time-settlement capability, cybersecurity capacity, fraud-monitoring systems, system redundancy, and uptime before onboarding. These strict audits ensure providers are fully prepared before joining the \"highway\". Strengthen and enforce dispute-resolution and AML frameworks: Effective interoperability requires a robust, regulator-led dispute-resolution framework to manage the risk of errors, fraud, and customer harm that arise from cross-network transactions. Stakeholders expect Bangladesh Bank to establish fast, transparent processes—with clear turnaround times, dedicated monitoring teams, mandatory provider cooperation, and digital logbooks of disputes. Typical TATs vary: technical timeouts can be resolved within minutes, whereas cases involving the wrong recipient may take several working days. Providers must freeze disputed funds, act in good faith during reversals, and maintain teams capable of resolving issues quickly to safeguard customer trust. Interoperability also increases AML/CFT and fraud-related vulnerabilities, demanding strict compliance and oversight. All participating entities must follow the Money Laundering Prevention Act, Anti-Terrorism Act and BFIU guidelines; ensure robust and regularly updated KYC practices; and report suspicious or fraudulent activity immediately. Strengthened internal controls, clear governance roles, and risk-mitigation protocols are essential to protect the ecosystem and maintain system integrity as digital financial services become increasingly interconnected. Phased onboarding and regulatory concessions: Interoperability introduces significant integration and compliance costs, especially for newer or smaller providers who must upgrade systems, hire technical staff, and strengthen their capacity for real-time payments. Similar challenges were seen in Kenya, where smaller banks struggled with capital-intensive upgrades during the PesaLink rollout, underscoring the need for phased onboarding and regulatory support. International experience shows that temporary regulatory concessions can accelerate adoption and create a more level playing field. For example, Jordan's JOMOPAY waived all provider fees, and providers themselves agreed to forgo interchange for the first two years, allowing the ecosystem to stabilise before cost-recovery mechanisms were introduced. Drawing on these lessons, Bangladesh Bank can promote integration testing through the central sandbox and waive switch and interchange fees for a defined period. To support providers and customers in adopting interoperability, Bangladesh Bank and the Government can explicitly support zero-switch fees during the early stages. Interoperability aims to address a significant economic challenge, extending far beyond a technical project. The BFP-B programme outlined operational and pricing options; Mojaloop now provides the technical rails. What is required now is coordinated execution: regulators setting clear, fair rules and timelines; dominant providers accepting temporary concessions in the interests of long-term market expansion; smaller players committing to strong operational standards; and donors and partners financing transition costs and technical assistance. When each stakeholder plays their part—regulators guaranteeing a level playing field, market leaders managing migration responsibly, and development partners de-risking initial costs—interoperability will move from pilots and conferences to everyday transactions that lower costs and broaden access for millions. Bangladesh can finally achieve interoperable digital payments—unlocking enormous value across households, MSMEs, government services, and the broader digital economy.

{"title": "In six violent encounters, evidence contradicts Trump immigration officials' narratives", "body": "US President Donald Trump's top immigration officials have repeatedly made statements after violent encounters involving federal agents - including two fatal shootings of US citizens in Minneapolis this month - that were later contradicted by evidence, a Reuters review found. Trump officials quickly painted the two recently shot dead - Renee Good and Alex Pretti - as aggressors and said the shootings were justified. But video and other evidence soon emerged that contrasted sharply with these accounts, fueling questions about the credibility of federal officials and doubts about their willingness to fully investigate these and other incidents. The Reuters review included these two incidents and four others in recent months that, collectively, show a pattern in which officials rushed to defend immigration officers without waiting for key facts to emerge – in what former immigration officials called a clear break with past practice for federal agencies in such situations. These initial representations have been challenged by video footage or other evidence, sometimes in court. In one non-lethal shooting in Minnesota, court documents emerged showing the incident began with a case of mistaken identity. A death in a detention center that the US Department of Homeland Security described as an attempted suicide was later ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner. \"They are trying to control a narrative from the very start, and they don't seem to care when they're proven wrong,\" said David Lapan, who was the DHS press secretary in 2017, during Trump's first administration. In response to a Reuters request for comment, DHS pointed to previous statements about the incidents involving their officers, stressing the need for officer safety as they carry out Trump's crackdown. \"We have seen a highly coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, adding that the department aims to \"give swift, accurate information to the American people.\" Here is a look at six incidents in Minneapolis, Chicago and Texas: DHS said Pretti brandished a gun but video showed a cell phone After Pretti, 37, was shot and killed during an encounter with US Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement noting that Pretti was carrying a firearm but did not say that it remained holstered. The statement said the encounter \"looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\" DHS said Pretti \"approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun\" in a post on the social network X, sharing a photo of the alleged weapon. \"The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,\" DHS said. White House aide Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump's immigration agenda, said on X that Pretti was a \"domestic terrorist\" and \"would-be assassin.\" Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone and not a gun as he was wrestled to the ground by the agents. Video evidence also showed that an officer removed Pretti's gun from his body shortly before the first shots were fired. He had a legal permit to carry the weapon. In response to a Reuters request for comment on Monday, DHS said in a statement that Pretti \"committed a federal crime while armed as he obstructed an active law enforcement operation\" and that the situation was \"evolving.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday that Trump \"wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead.\" DHS claims Good 'weaponized her vehicle' Homeland Security described Good, the 37-year-old woman shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on 7 January, as a \"violent rioter\" who had \"weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them - an act of domestic terrorism.\" It said the officer who killed her \"saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.\" Trump said Good \"ran over the ICE officer,\" who he said shot her in self-defense. Videos of the shooting taken from several vantage points – including cell phone video recorded by the officer who shot Good – conflicted with those claims. The videos show Good in her car as agents rushed up toward her as her vehicle partly blocked the street. One of the agents, Jonathan Ross, positioned himself near the front of her car; another was standing by the driver-side window. The videos show the car moving forward, its wheels turned away from Ross, who drew his weapon and fired three shots at Good as her car went past, killing her. Video reviewed by Reuters appeared to show Ross and the vehicle making contact, but Reuters could not determine whether Ross touched the vehicle or if it struck him. ICE pursued car thinking driver was someone else On 15 January, DHS said officers \"were conducting a targeted traffic stop\" in Minneapolis for Venezuelan immigrant Julio Sosa-Celis when he sped away, crashed his car and fled on foot to an apartment building. DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis and two other men hit an ICE officer who pursued him with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting. Court documents unsealed last week told a different story. An FBI affidavit said the ICE officers had scanned a license plate registered with a different person suspected of an immigration violation, leading them to chase the wrong person before the alleged assault and shooting. The affidavit said another man was driving the car and was the sole occupant - not Sosa-Celis. The car's actual driver - another Venezuelan immigrant - crashed and fled to an apartment building where Sosa-Celis was present, it said. At the apartment building, an ICE officer trying to detain the car's driver was struck by him and Sosa-Celis with a broom – and a third man with a shovel – before the officer fired his weapon, the FBI affidavit said. While DHS said initially that the officer \"fired a defensive shot to defend his life\" during the ambush, the FBI affidavit said the alleged attackers dropped the broom and shovel when they saw the officer draw his gun and were fleeing toward the apartment as he fired. Robin Wolpert, an attorney representing Sosa-Celis, said he would plead not guilty if indicted. Wolpert said the affidavit established that the ICE officer shot Sosa-Celis from 10 feet away as he was fleeing, which showed the officer \"was not in immediate danger.\" DHS did not address the FBI affidavit with the different account of the incident when asked for comment. Shifting statements after detention death When US Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos in a Texas detention center on 3 January, it said he experienced \"medical distress\" and that the incident was being investigated. A 15 January report in the Washington Post said the El Paso County medical examiner's office was likely to rule it a homicide, with the preliminary cause of death \"asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.\" The Post cited a witness who said guards were choking Lunas, who said he could not breathe, details that were absent from ICE's statement. DHS issued a new statement after the article was published that said Lunas tried to commit suicide and then resisted security officers and died. The medical examiner released a report last week that found the death was a homicide due to asphyxia from neck and torso compression, according to the Post. The death was one of six deaths in ICE detention in January, an unusually high number. Judge calls out government's 'widespread misrepresentations' A federal judge wrote in a November opinion restricting immigration agents' use of force in Chicago that the government's \"widespread misrepresentations call into question everything that defendants say they are doing in their characterization\" of the crackdown. In one instance, Homeland Security posted on X that \"rioters surrounded law enforcement\" and \"attacked\" a van carrying detainees, an encounter that escalated until someone threw a rock at Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino, hitting him in the head. Five days later, Bovino said in court that the rock had not hit him when he first deployed tear gas. \"It did almost hit me,\" he said. US District Court Judge Sara Ellis said Bovino \"lied multiple times\" about why he needed to throw a tear gas canister at protesters. Neither DHS nor Bovino responded to requests for comment about the incident and the comments by Ellis. In the same case, Ellis also questioned authorities' claims that they needed to use tear gas so that they could leave the scene of another operation in October, saying the agents themselves had prolonged the encounter through their actions. \"Every minor inconsistency adds up, and at some point, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything\" the government said, Ellis wrote. Homeland Security said in a statement after the ruling that officers were facing \"rioters, gangbangers and terrorists\" and that they had shown \"incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated.\" Government drops case against US citizen shot by border agent On 4 October, Homeland Security said that several drivers \"rammed\" law enforcement officers in Broadview, a Chicago suburb where an immigration detention center has been the site of clashes between protesters and immigration agents. DHS said one of the drivers, a woman, was \"armed with a semi-automatic weapon\" and that law enforcement was \"forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed US citizen.\" The woman, US citizen Marimar Martinez, was shot by an agent five times. She survived and was indicted on charges of impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon. The officer later boasted of his marksmanship in text messages shared in court. Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, told the court that footage from one of the agents' bodycams contradicted the DHS account. Martinez, 30, said that one of the agents actually rammed her vehicle with his. Parente told Reuters Martinez left her gun in her purse on the passenger seat and never brandished it. DHS was wrong about the location of the incident – it occurred in the Chicago neighborhood of Brighton Park, not Broadview. On 20 November, government prosecutors asked the court to dismiss the case against Martinez, saying it was \"reviewing new facts and information\" from the months-long operation. DHS referred any questions about federal charges to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"title": "Meet NEO: The $20,000 eerie humanoid robot", "body": "For years, the dream of having a humanoid robot doing household chores seemed like something from a sci-fi film. This week, that fantasy edged closer to reality — sort of. Robotics company 1X has unveiled the NEO Home Robot, claiming it to be the world's first consumer-ready humanoid robot. Yet, the launch has sparked as many questions as it has excitement. Standing 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 30 kilograms, NEO looks every bit the futuristic home companion. Its soft polymer body, available in tan, grey, and dark brown, gives it a friendly appearance. It connects via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even 5G, allowing users to issue voice commands or operate it through a mobile app. NEO can lift up to 68 kilograms and carry 25, impressive numbers for a domestic robot. But there is a catch — it still needs humans to guide it. According to The Wall Street Journal, NEO currently cannot perform household tasks autonomously. Instead, remote operators from 1X, wearing VR headsets, control it in real time, teaching it how to perform new chores. These sessions help the robot \"learn,\" but they also mean that a human somewhere is virtually stepping inside your home through NEO's cameras. The company promises strict privacy controls and visible signals when the robot is being remotely operated. Despite its limitations, NEO is a significant step in bringing humanoid robotics to homes. It folds shirts, closes dishwashers, and might one day cook a meal. Priced at $20,000, or $499 a month on lease, it offers a vision of tomorrow's household helper. robots / Neo Robot", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/meet-neo-20000-eerie-humanoid-robot-1274226", "date": "2025-11-01T12:05:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 01 November, 2025, 12:05 pm Last modified: 02 November, 2025, 03:22 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 264, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:21:11.006241"}
{"title": "Path cleared for Nadal but obstacles remain at U.S. Open", "body": "Only Matteo Berrettini stands between Rafa Nadal and a fifth final at Flushing Meadows where the stage has been all but cleared for the Spaniard to claim a 19th grand slam title. The draw always looked kind to second seed Nadal, who was guaranteed of avoiding fellow greats Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer until the final. But with those two swept away on the other side of the draw, Nadal instead will meet either Daniil Medvedev or Grigor Dimitrov if he gets to Sunday’s final. First the Spaniard must get past 23-year-old Italian Berrettini in what will be the pair’s first encounter. Big serving Berrettini is having a breakout year, with two titles under his belt, one on grass and one on clay, and is now on the brink of becoming the first Italian male grand slam finalist in more than 40 years. While a well-rested Nadal has breezed through to the final four, dropping only one set and even enjoying a walkover in the second round, Berrettini has shed sweat and tears to claw his way this far. Taken to four sets in each of his first three matches by unseeded opponents, he was later stretched to the limit by Gael Monfils in a quarter-final thriller on Wednesday that went to a final-set tiebreak. How well Berrettini, in his eighth grand slam, recovers from that four-hour marathon could be crucial. Meanwhile, Medvedev has ridden a hot streak into the other semi-final, where he unexpectedly finds himself up against an opponent few expected to go deep into the championship. Medvedev has a 19-2 record since Wimbledon, racking up three straight appearances in finals, losing in Washington and Montreal before claiming the Cincinnati title. The Russian fifth seed has continued his winning run at the U.S. Open, though his path has not been without obstacles and been taken to four sets in each of his past four matches. His run at Flushing Meadows is the deepest he has gone in a Grand Slam but in the semi-finals faces a resurgent Dimitrov who is brimming with confidence after beating Federer in a five-set quarter-final.

The visitors struggled to 35-3 at lunch with Roston Chase (12) and Jermaine Blackwood (one) at the crease after opener John Campbell retired hurt due to a toe injury. Barbados-born Archer dismissed Kraigg Brathwaite for four in the sixth over with a moving ball that the opener edged onto the stumps, before he trapped Shamarh Brooks lbw. Wood bowled Shai Hope for nine to leave the West Indies in trouble at 27-3. Earlier, England were bowled out for 313 in their second innings. They resumed on 284-8 — a lead of 170 — with tail-enders Archer and Wood at the crease but the overnight pair failed to offer much resistance. Wood was the first to be dismissed as he looked to raise the scoring rate, edging paceman Shannon Gabriel to wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich as England were reduced to 303-9. Archer, who had taken England past the 300-run mark with a cracking cover drive off skipper Jason Holder, became Gabriel's fifth victim of the innings as he edged a short-pitched ball to the keeper when on 23. Gabriel finished with figures of 5-75 — his sixth five-wicket haul in tests — while Roston Chase and Alzarri Joseph picked up two wickets apiece.

The ICC is yet to decide the fate of the T20 World Cup in Australia which is scheduled to take place from October 18 to November 15. \"There are rumors that the World Cup was clashing with the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Australia-India series, therefore, it (T20 World Cup) won't take place,\" Inzamam said in his YouTube channel on Sunday. \"The Indian board is strong and has control in the International Cricket Council (ICC). If Australia says that we cannot hold the World Cup because of the COVID-19 pandemic, then their stance will be easily accepted, but if any such kind event happens during the same time, then questions will be raised,\" he said. The 50-year-old former batsman, who has scored 8830 runs in 120 Tests and 11739 runs in 378 ODIs for Pakistan, further said: \"People will think, if a country could host 12 to 14 teams (16 teams), then why the ICC could not look after the teams, after all Australia is such an advanced country. \"Another thing is the ICC should not be allowed to give priority to private leagues (IPL) on international cricket. This will lead to young players forcing on private leagues other than international matches.\" The former coach, however, agreed that it is not easy to host 16 nations during the T20 World Cup. \"Australia can say that it was difficult for it to manage 18 teams (16) for the mega event as it is not easy. Likewise, the Pakistan team was in England in a hotel and all the facilities were being provided there, therefore, it has not been easy to manage 18 teams (16),\" he said. The fate of Asia Cup which PCB will be hosting in a neutral country for security reason is also an issue as no one knows the fate of the tournament originally scheduled in September. Inzamam said: \"I have also heard that objections are also raised on the dates of the Asia Cup as it is clashing with some other event. \"The ICC, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and all cricket boards should sit together and give a strong message that any such kind of impression (giving priority to private leagues instead of international cricket), won't take place,\" he said.

{"title": "Nagorik Coalition condemns Ibn Sina Pharma for ‘discriminatory’ male-only, Muslim-only job criteria", "body": "Nagorik Coalition, a civil society platform, has strongly condemned a job circular issued by The Ibn Sina Pharmaceutical Industry PLC that restricts applications to male, practicing Muslim candidates, calling the requirement discriminatory and a violation of Bangladesh's Constitution and labour laws. In a press statement today (5 February), the coalition criticised the criteria, saying they \"have no credible connection to the professional competencies required for legal and compliance work in a modern corporate environment.\" It emphasised that the conditions are ethically indefensible and conflict with Articles 27 and 28 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law, prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex and religion, and ensure women equal rights in all spheres of state and public life. The statement also noted that the circular undermines the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006, which ensures equal protection for workers regardless of sex or religion and promotes equality in employment and wages for work of equal value. \"When a leading company normalises exclusion based on identity, it weakens these protections and sends a signal that constitutional and labour-law norms are optional,\" the statement added. Excluding women and non-Muslims from a senior legal position, it said, is not a matter of \"preference\" or \"cultural fit\" but a direct assertion that citizenship and merit are subordinated to narrow identity markers. Other screening conditions in the circular were criticised as unrelated to job performance, with a call for corporate hiring standards to be job-relevant, proportionate, and consistent with fundamental rights. The coalition has called for immediately withdraw the circular and issue a public clarification and apology.

{"title": "Unofficial Hong Kong vote sees new generation take over battle for democracy", "body": "A younger, more defiant generation of Hong Kong democrats has secured the most votes in unofficial primary elections in the Chinese-ruled city, setting the stage for a battle with pro-Beijing politicians for control of the city's legislature. The success of young contenders in the primaries organised by the pro-democracy camp on the weekend to pick candidates for a Sept. 6 election for a 70-seat city assembly comes amid widespread resentment of a national security law that Beijing imposed last month. Beijing denounced the vote as illegal and warned it may have violated the new security law, which has raised fears for the freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong's open society and success as a financial hub. Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong won in his district, but he has been disqualified from previous elections and could face similar hurdles this time. Wong warned against any sweeping disqualification of candidates when he held a news conference with 15 other young politicians who won in their districts. \"If the government cracks down on us and disqualifies all the candidates who joined the primaries, it will cause more outrage in the international community and encourage more people to vote for the pro-democratic camp in September,\" Wong said. The 16 - all but one under 30 and dressed in black T-shirts - are part of a so-called localist or resistance camp, which outshone the cohort of traditional democrats, which had secured 12 candidate slots as of Wednesday afternoon. Full results are expected later in the day. The localists - a term for those who do not see themselves as Chinese and focus on saving the former British colony's freedoms - tend to be more assertive than traditional democrats. The localists talk of resistance and saving democracy but they do not all have the same vision for Hong Kong's future. Some dream of independence - anathema for Beijing - but do not speak of it openly, which would see them fall foul of the new security law and face up to life in prison. Their performance in the primaries reflects frustration, especially among younger voters, with Hong Kong's more moderate, traditional pro-democracy politicians. \"Localism has become the mainstream,\" said localist candidate Henry Wong. \"We will resist against the tyranny.\" The new security law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and sees Chinese intelligence agents operating officially in the city for the first time. Critics fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of often violent anti-government protests. Difficult to understand The law has already had a chilling effect on many aspects of life. Earlier on Wednesday, former democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin said he was pulling out as an organiser of the weekend vote amid accusations from Beijing that it was illegal. A spokesman for Beijing's top office in the city, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, said the pro-democracy camp's bid for a legislative majority was an attempt to carry out a \"colour revolution\", referring to uprisings in other parts of the world. In comments that critics said were aimed at instilling fear, the Liaison Office as well as Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the city's leader, Carrie Lam, have all said the primaries could violate the national security law. Benny Tai, another organiser of the pro-democracy polls, was defiant. \"For those who do not recognise democracy, or do not agree with democratic values, it is difficult to understand the meaning of the primary election,\" Tai said. Hong Kong police on Wednesday arrested the vice chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Lo Kin-hei, on charges of unlawful assembly related to a protest in November. The political tension in Hong Kong has alarmed the business community while the new law has raised concern in countries that support the \"one country, two systems\" formula of government meant to safeguard its freedoms. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong's special status under US law to punish China for what he called \"oppressive actions\" against the city. China said it would impose retaliatory sanctions on US individuals and entities after Trump signed a law penalising banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new law. In an interview with state agency Xinhua, Chief Executive Lam said US sanctions won't hurt Hong Kong and in time, concern about the security law would prove unfounded. In another blow to the city's standing, the New York Times said it would shift part of its Hong Kong office to Seoul, as worries grow that the security law will curb media and other freedoms. hong kong / Democracy / primary election", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/politics/unofficial-hong-kong-vote-sees-new-generation-take-over-battle-democracy-107026", "date": "2020-07-16T13:35:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 16 July, 2020, 01:35 pm Last modified: 16 July, 2020, 01:41 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 799, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:21:24.145459"}

Replying to a question by CPI(M) MP John Brittas in the Rajya Sabha yesterday (29 January), he said India has consistently raised the matter of safety and security of the minorities with the authorities in Bangladesh, at both political and diplomatic levels on several occasions. The issue was raised by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his meeting with Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus on 4 April 2025 and by the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his meeting with Foreign Advisor Touhid Hossain on 16 February last year, Singh said. The issue has also been discussed during relevant discussions with other foreign interlocutors, he added. According to Singh, \"it is the expectation of the government of India that the interim government of Bangladesh will discharge its responsibilities by thoroughly investigating these incidents and bring all perpetrators of killings, arson and violence against minorities to justice without excuses.\" \"The primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the government of Bangladesh,\" the minister said. Brittas asked four questions whether the Indian government has taken cognisance of reports of attacks, killings, arson and intimidation targeting minorities in Bangladesh and the deterioration of law and order; the number and details of formal representations made by India to the government of Bangladesh on protection of minorities during the last two years; whether these concerns were raised at the political or diplomatic level and Bangladesh's response thereto and whether India proposes to seek concrete assurances or international monitoring to ensure the safety of minorities in Bangladesh.

{"title": "Alongside applause, Bangladesh’s new climate pledge deserves global support", "body": "So far, only about three dozen countries have submitted their new climate pledges, known as NDC 3.0, under the Paris Agreement. These are not just technical documents; they are moral and political statements of intent, showing how far nations are willing and able to go to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Among these few, Bangladesh's submission stands out. It is more comprehensive, data-driven, and inclusive than before, and it even puts a price tag on what its climate ambition will cost. Yet, while it marks real progress, it still falls short of the transformational shift needed to truly align with the 1.5°C goal. A sharper, broader climate vision Bangladesh's NDC 3.0 takes a whole-of-economy approach, covering energy, transport, agriculture, and industry. It uses 2022 as a baseline year and pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20.3% (418.4 MtCO₂e) by 2035. Of this, 6.4% (26.74 MtCO₂e) will be achieved through domestic efforts, while another 13.9% (58.23 MtCO₂e) will depend on international support. In 2022, total emissions reached 252.04 MtCO₂e, with energy as the largest source (48.81%), followed by agriculture, forestry and land use (37.83%), waste (10.69%), and industry (2.67%). Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel That level of clarity is rare among developing countries. Bangladesh has also established a national system for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) progress, which will help track emissions and open doors to future carbon markets. Equally impressive is the financial honesty of the plan. The NDC 3.0 estimates that it will require about US$116 billion by 2035 to deliver on its climate goals. Around US$25.95 billion will come from domestic resources, while the remaining US$90.23 billion will require support from international partners. It also reports approximately US$3 billion in annual climate-induced losses and damages, and seeks full global support for recovery and resilience across key sectors. Very few developing countries have gone this far in quantifying the real cost of climate action. The plan also recognises that climate policy is not just about emissions. It includes 65 adaptation actions linked to Bangladesh's National Adaptation Plan, with clear attention to gender equality, disability, and social inclusion. For the first time, it introduces the concept of a \"just transition,\" acknowledging that climate action must also be fair, socially inclusive, and economically viable. The 1.5-degree question Despite its strengths, the NDC 3.0 does not yet demonstrate how the proposed cuts fit into a pathway that keeps global temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius. It claims consistency with the Paris Agreement but does not present any emissions modelling or analysis to back that up. Without clear evidence such as carbon budgets, projected trajectories, or sensitivity analyses, it is difficult to know whether the 20% target is ambitious enough. A technical annex linking these targets to the upcoming Long-Term Low-Emission Development Strategy would give Bangladesh far more credibility and confidence in the international arena — and the country has recently taken the initiative to formulate one. Ambition, equity, and realism At first glance, Bangladesh's 20% target may seem modest compared with countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, or Moldova, which have pledged cuts of 35 to 75% by 2035. But national context matters. Bangladesh contributes very less of total global emissions, yet it faces some of the most severe climate risks in the world. The problem is not a lack of political will, but a lack of financial and technological capacity. Expecting Bangladesh to decarbonise deeply without significant international support would be unfair and burdensome. Still, the government could make its case stronger by publishing a \"conditionality matrix\" showing exactly which measures depend on what level of support, and what greater ambition could be unlocked if that support becomes available. Counting loss and damage One of the most promising features of Bangladesh's NDC 3.0 is that it acknowledges loss and damage as a national priority. This issue, long neglected in global negotiations, is crucial for a country that faces growing economic losses from both slow-onset and extreme events every year. Bangladesh has already done the hard work of setting goals and estimating costs. What it now needs is an implementation roadmap that connects ambition to real projects. Development partners and investors need to know where and how they can contribute, which ministries are responsible, and what the timelines and risk-sharing mechanisms will look like. However, most of the 65 proposed adaptation measures remain uncosted and lack defined indicators or designated implementing agencies. Without these critical details, mobilising international adaptation finance will remain a challenge. Bangladesh now needs to strengthen its institutional readiness, undertake comprehensive loss and damage assessments, ensure policy coherence, foster inclusive stakeholder engagement, and establish transparent and accountable systems for effective access to the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD). Furthermore, transitioning towards measurable adaptation plans would enhance both domestic accountability and international credibility, reinforcing Bangladesh's position in the global call for loss and damage financing. From targets to action Bangladesh has already done the hard work of setting goals and estimating costs. What it now needs is an implementation roadmap that connects ambition to real projects. Development partners and investors need to know where and how they can contribute, which ministries are responsible, and what the timelines and risk-sharing mechanisms will look like. A practical \"NDC Implementation Plan\" could identify priority projects, their budgets, and expected emission reductions. This would not only help attract internal and private sector finance but also turn the climate plan into a living instrument for development. Inclusion beyond consultation Bangladesh deserves praise for involving civil society, youth groups, and the private sector in the NDC process. But participation is only the first step. True inclusion means giving local governments the authority and resources to act, ensuring gender-responsive budgets, and creating opportunities for young people to join a low-carbon workforce. A \"National Just Transition Fund\" or local climate action grants could make these commitments real, ensuring that the path to a green economy does not leave vulnerable communities behind. A call for partnership Bangladesh's NDC 3.0 is far from perfect, but it is honest and credible. It sets out what the country can achieve on its own, what depends on external support, and what it will cost. It is a realistic and responsible plan that reflects both ambition and humility. To move from \"Paris-aligned\" to truly \"1.5-degree-aligned,\" Bangladesh needs transparent modelling, a clear financing framework, and a pipeline of investable projects. But it also needs trust and partnership. If the world wants developing countries to raise their climate ambition, wealthier nations must meet them halfway — with finance, technology, and fair market access. Bangladesh has laid out a serious plan; now it is time for the international community to help turn that plan into action. For Bangladesh, as for many other climate-vulnerable nations, this is not merely an exercise for measuring emissions or budgeting (for mitigation). It is a commitment to protect people and the planet, to safeguard hard-earned progress, to sustain prosperity along cleaner and greener pathways, and to uphold the fundamental right to a liveable future.

{"title": "No respite from work – even in isolation", "body": "I have to arrange tests for patients who come with Covid-19 symptoms, put the houses of positive patients under lockdown, lift the lockdown when they recover, and make arrangements for a funeral when an infected person dies. I have contracted the coronavirus while performing duty and am now in isolation, but I do not have the opportunity to refrain from work. So, I am still working with patients over the phone. I work as a medical officer (disease control) at the Naria Upazila Health Complex in Shariatpur. We have been working since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak as it is an area inhabited by expatriates. We have expatriates in every house here. Since I work as a Covid-19 focal person at this hospital, I have to oversee patients from the time they show symptoms, test positive, until they recover. We have only one technologist in the hospital. At the beginning of the outbreak in the country, I, along with the technologist, would collect samples going door-to-door. But soon there was a spurt in the number of patients and at the same time phone calls started coming from different unions of the upazila for collecting samples. It became difficult for us to go from one house to another and collect samples. So, after Eid, we are having patients come to the hospital for giving samples. However, the number of people coming to the hospital with symptoms every day is much higher than the number of samples we collect. We have to tell those from whom we cannot collect samples to come the next day. We collect samples and send those to Dhaka. After receiving test reports from there, I lock down the positive patients' houses with the help of the local administration and police. I need to make people understand how to abide by health guidelines and what they have to do in ailment. But there still prevails coronavirus-related stigma among village people. People still dislike infected people. When someone catches the virus, neighbours maltreat them. We face protests from locals while locking down congested areas similar to slums where many live in small houses. In the past, our biggest problem was to bury people who died from Covid-19. No one allowed the burial of a person who died from Covid-19 in their neighbourhoods. We tried a lot to make them realise that the coronavirus does not transmit from a dead body, but no one was ready to listen to us. In many cases, we had to take help from police for the burial of dead bodies. But now, with many people being infected, the social stigma has decreased a bit. In the meantime, I tested positive myself on June 27. I am currently in isolation in the hospital dormitory and taking care of myself. My colleagues are also helping me a lot. On the night of July 2, my oxygen level dropped and my condition worsened. But now I am fine. I will resume work after I recover. But I still have to work from isolation. As it is an area inhabited by expatriates, we have to do tests, provide treatment as well as issue Covid-19 negative certificates for those who wish to go abroad. People here are now dashing for this certificate as it is mandatory for going abroad. The number of patients in the upazila has increased a lot due to community transmission. But we are doing our best to make people obey health safety guidelines. I got admitted to Dhaka Medical College in the 2012-2013 session. While doing my internship, I sat for the 39th BCS examination and got selected for the job. I was posted in Naria upazila of Shariatpur in December 2019. I have been here since then.

{"title": "Farooki’s Television explores religious orthodoxy confronted with modern technology", "body": "The camera flashes, Chairman Amin looks downwards, the photographer asks him to open his eyes and look at the camera. Amin looks at the camera helplessly - as if the whole world is crumbling in front of him. The photographer keeps taking photos. This is a scene from Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's acclaimed film \"Television.\" And the scene, like the rest of the movie, speaks volumes. Watch the trailer of \"Television\" here The film's narrative revolves around the lives of people of a village in Noakhali, Chandpur, and the head of the village Chairman, Amin (Shahir Kazi Huda). Amin is a devout Muslim who has forbidden every sort of image in the village as he believes it goes against Islam. He is an authoritarian but has good intentions for his people. In the opening scene of the film, he hides behind a huge screen while being interviewed on TV following the bizarre norms of the village. The chairman condemns all forms of new technology in the village, including television and mobile phones. Never in his life had Amin taken a photo of himself but the prospect of going to Hajj compelled him to take one. On the other hand, Amin's son - Solaiman (Chanchal Chowdhury), with the help of one of his employees - Mojnu (Mosharraf Karim), acquires a mobile phone to talk to his girlfriend, Kohinoor (Nusrat Imrose Tisha). After many interesting twists and turns, the film ends with a television serving as a tool for Amin to connect to God. The irony of the scene is that it was a television that helped Amin connect to God. \"Television\" was the officially selected film from Bangladesh to compete at the 86th Academy Awards for the Best Foreign Language Film. It created buzz at the 17th Busan Film Festival in 2012 and received rave reviews. Writing about the film, The Hollywood Reporter said: Mostofa Sarwar Farooki could be the next South Asian filmmaker to break out. Set in a small village and basking in the little details of daily Bengali life- and not even hinging on Muslim/Hindu tension- the film about progress and the bonds of family boasts production values high for the region which should guarantee it a place in several high profile festivals and with any luck limited, targeted release overseas. So, what is so great about \"Television?\" First and foremost - the script. Secondly, the acting and authentic characters. And most importantly, the philosophical metaphors used in the film that raise questions on religious beliefs and morals. Written by Mostofa Sarwar Farooki and Anisul Haque, \"Television\" intrigued me from beginning to end. The actors in the film delivered their characters with delight, and all of them spoke in the Noakhali dialect which added versatility to their characters. Screentime shared by Mosharraf Karim and Chanchal Chowdhury in the film is my favourite. Their characters together created some uplifting moments of brotherly love. As a supporting character, Mosharraf Karim's Monju stole the spotlight in every scene he was featured in. As an obedient son of the chairman, Chanchal Chowdhury played his character of Solaiman with authenticity. Tisha's performance as Kohinoor was remarkable. Veteran actor Shahir Kazi Huda portrayed the chairman's character to perfection. Huda carried the character's dimensions well. Regardless of Amin's faith, he is a caring father and someone who truly cares for his people as the head of the village. He constantly tries to ensure the security and well-being of the villagers. Cinematographer Golam Maola Nobir devised unusual, bright and colourful camera angles that made the fun moments of the film more enjoyable. Inclusion of ambient sound in almost every scene gives the feel of rural life-style, creating a realistic mood on screen. Legendary musician Ayub Bachchu was the film's music composer. Overall, \"Television\" is one of the greatest movies produced in Bangladesh this decade. The film can be watched on streaming site Hoichoi.

{"title": "Proton ecosystem review: A privacy-first alternative to big tech", "body": "Have you ever stopped to wonder just how much of your personal data is floating around online? Every email you send, every file you store, every calendar event you create, chances are, it is being tracked, analysed, or stored for purposes you never agreed to. Big tech platforms make life convenient, yes — but at what cost? If you have ever felt uneasy about handing over your digital life to companies built on advertising and data collection, you are not alone. That is where the Proton ecosystem steps in. Built with privacy at its core, Proton offers a full suite of services — from email and cloud storage to VPN and password management — designed to put you back in control. But is it really possible to escape the grip of Google, Apple, or Microsoft? Can Proton's privacy-first promise actually deliver everything you need to live and work securely online? Let us take a closer look. At its core, the Proton ecosystem comprises a growing list of applications – ProtonMail, Drive, Calendar, VPN, Pass (password manager), Docs, and a recently acquired notes app (Standard Notes). These tools are built with privacy as the foundation, featuring open-source architecture and strong encryption protocols. The company is headquartered in Switzerland, where data protection laws are among the world's most robust. One of the key attractions of the Proton ecosystem is its integration. Unlike patching together services from different privacy-focused providers, Proton's suite allows users to work across email, storage, calendar, and passwords with a unified account. For example, a document saved in Proton Drive can be accessed directly through a calendar invite, and encrypted emails can seamlessly link to stored attachments. This level of interoperability is still rare among privacy-first tools. While the ecosystem is nearly complete, a dedicated note-taking app remains the only major omission — although that gap is expected to close soon with the integration of Standard Notes. Proton Drive exemplifies the ecosystem's priorities. It uses zero-access encryption, ensuring that only the user can access their files — not even Proton's staff have the keys. The drive supports file sharing with password protection and link expiration, enhancing security for collaborative tasks. Integration with version history and recovery tools also makes it suitable for both personal and professional use. However, upload and download speeds on Proton Drive lag behind mainstream alternatives. File recovery is straightforward, but the free plan only permits restoring up to 10 previous versions within seven days. Cross-platform support is solid, with applications available for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS. For Linux or Chromebook users, a web interface is available, though it lacks the polish of the dedicated apps. Proton Drive also integrates with some productivity suites, but it does not match the full compatibility offered by mainstream providers like Google Workspace. Do you feel uneasy knowing your inbox might be scanned for keywords or ad targeting? With ProtonMail, that worry disappears. It offers end-to-end encryption by default — meaning only you and your recipient can read your messages, not even Proton itself. You can set self-destructing emails, use custom domains, and manage calendars and contacts within the same encrypted environment. The interface may not feel quite as polished as Gmail's for some, but it is fast improving. And for those who value peace of mind over polish, Proton Mail delivers exactly that. You can also create multiple email aliases — useful for separating work, personal, or newsletter subscriptions without juggling multiple accounts. For users dealing with constant spam or tracking, this feature alone can feel like a breath of fresh air. If you use a VPN to protect your browsing, ask yourself: do you trust the provider not to log your activity? Many say they do not track you, but Proton VPN backs that promise with Swiss privacy laws, open-source code, and independent audits. Proton VPN is easy to set up across devices and is surprisingly reliable. For those switching from services like Surfshark or ExpressVPN, Proton's no-drop connections and privacy-first policies often come as a welcome change. Ever wished your password manager, cloud storage, and document editor all came from one provider — and all respected your privacy? Proton makes that a reality. Proton Pass lets you store and autofill passwords securely. Proton Docs, the ecosystem's word processor, works for simple collaboration but is best when everyone involved also uses Proton. The lack of a built-in note-taking app may be noticeable — at least for now. Proton has acquired Standard Notes and is expected to bring it into the fold soon, completing the suite. The entire experience is backed by encryption and unified under one account. No pop-ups. No tracking. Just tools that focus on doing their job without watching yours. At first glance, Proton may seem pricey, especially compared to mainstream storage options. But the cost covers far more than just cloud space. It includes secure email, VPN, password manager, and more – bundled into one privacy-focused ecosystem. With flexible plans like Unlimited, Duo, and Family, users can choose what suits them best. A 30-day money-back guarantee offers a safe way to try it out. A free tier offers basic access to Mail, Drive, and Calendar. The Proton ecosystem is not flawless, but it is principled. It delivers on its promise of putting user privacy first and does so with a well-integrated, rapidly expanding suite of tools. For those disillusioned with data-hungry platforms, Proton offers an increasingly viable exit path. Still, the decision to switch entirely depends on priorities. If maximum convenience and speed trump concerns about privacy, then mainstream platforms remain hard to beat. But for users who value control over their digital footprint, Proton presents a thoughtful and well-rounded alternative.

{"title": "Israel reopens Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt, with tight limits", "body": "Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday (2 February) for a limited number of people on foot, allowing a small number of Palestinians to leave the enclave and some of those who escaped the war to return for the first time. The crossing, in Israeli-held territory in what was once a city of a quarter of a million people that Israel has since completely demolished and depopulated, is the sole route in or out for nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million residents. It has been largely shut for most of the war, and reopening it to give even a small number of Gaza residents access to the outside world is one of the last major steps required under the initial phase of a US-brokered ceasefire reached in October. A Palestinian source said that on the first day, 50 Palestinians were expected to enter Gaza, where they will face stringent Israeli security checks, and a similar number would be permitted to leave. Those allowed to enter would be among the more than 100,000 Palestinians who had been able to escape Gaza in the early months of the war. By mid-morning, it was not yet clear how many, if any, had yet crossed. An Israeli security official confirmed Rafah had opened \"for both entry and exit.\" Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by the October ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump. Reopening the crossing was one of the requirements under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants. In January, Trump declared the start of the second phase, meant to see the sides negotiate Gaza's future governance and reconstruction. Even as the crossing reopened, Israeli strikes killed at least four Palestinians on Monday, including a three-year-old boy, in separate incidents in the north and south of the Strip. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the incidents. Israeli Inspection In the first nine months of the war, some 100,000 Palestinians exited to Egypt through the Rafah crossing. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Some are believed to have paid bribes to secure permission to enter Egypt. After Israeli forces swept into the area, they closed the crossing, apart from a brief opening for the evacuation of medical patients during a ceasefire in early 2025. The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza, with only a few thousand allowed out for medical treatment in third countries by other routes through Israel over the past year. Palestinians seeking to cross at Rafah after the reopening will require Israeli security approval, three Egyptian sources said. Reinforced concrete walls, topped with barbed wire, have been installed along the crossing area, the sources said. Gazans entering and exiting will have to walk for 2.5 km (1.5 miles) along a track through the Israeli-held border area known as the Philadelphi corridor, the sources said. At the crossing, they will have to pass through three separate gates, including one administered by the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority under the supervision of a European Union task force but controlled remotely by Israel. Foreign Journalists Barred From Gaza Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war. Reporting from inside Gaza for international media, including Reuters, is carried out solely by journalists who live there, hundreds of whom have been killed. Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza. Government lawyers argue this could pose risks to Israeli soldiers. The FPA says the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, major combat was halted, hostages held in Gaza were released in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, and a surge in humanitarian aid was promised. Israeli forces still hold more than 53% of Gaza's territory, where they have ordered residents out and demolished many remaining buildings. The enclave's residents are now confined to a strip along the coast, where most live either in makeshift tents or damaged buildings. The next phase of Trump's plan foresees Hamas giving up its weapons and relinquishing control to an internationally backed administration that would oversee reconstruction, including luxury residential buildings along the Mediterranean coast. Many Israelis and Palestinians see this as unrealistic. Hamas has yet to agree to give up its weapons, and Israel says it is prepared to restart the war to disarm the group by force. The war began when Hamas fighters attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel retaliated, destroying much of Gaza and killing more than 70,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say, while militants have killed four Israeli soldiers. On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce the previous day when troops clashed with militants in Rafah.

The BBL's increase to 56 regular season matches from the 2018/19 tournament has been unpopular with players and pundits, some of whom blamed its length for disappointing crowds in the last edition. However, CA have confirmed the BBL will have its earliest ever start from Dec. 3 and finish with the championship-deciding final on Feb. 6. The early start offers CA some leeway in dealing with problems that may arise due to COVID-19, which prompted authorities to send Melbourne back into lockdown last week following a spike in infections. The early matches will also clash with Australia's series-opening test against India at the Gabba from Dec. 3. After the BBL schedule was released, Brisbane Heat captain Chris Lynn, an outspoken critic of the last tournament, tweeted: \"The Golden Goose has been cooked again,\" before deleting the post. CA also announced the Women's Big Bash League would have a full 59-match schedule running from Oct. 17 to Nov. 29, with 26 matches carried live by broadcasters, three more than the 2019 tournament. The players union welcomed the certainty given by the scheduling. \"While our position on the length of the (men's) BBL season and its ability to attract the world's best players is well known, we appreciate the challenges ... in developing a schedule which satisfies all stakeholders in these extraordinary circumstances,\" Australian Cricketers' Association General Manager Cricket Operations Brendan Drew said.

{"title": "Jamal Khashoggi murder trial begins at Turkey", "body": "Turkey has begun the murder trial of Saudi journalist Jama Khashoggi against twenty Saudi nationals in absentia today. He was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, reports BBC. Those being tried include two former top aides to Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi was a vocal critic of the prince. Saudi Arabia carried out a separate trial over the killing that was heavily criticised as incomplete. The trial in Istanbul follows an international outcry over the murder, which tarnished the prince's reputation. Turkish prosecutors accuse the former deputy head of Saudi intelligence, Ahmed al-Asiri, and the royal court's media adviser Saud al-Qahtani of having led the operation and instructed a Saudi hit team. The other 18 defendants are accused of having suffocated Khashoggi, whose remains have not been found. Turkish officials say his body was dismembered and removed to an unknown site. The journalist, who was resident in the US, had entered the consulate seeking papers for his impending wedding. His fiancee Hatice Cengiz is attending the trial alongside the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Agnes Callamard, who has directly linked the crown prince to the killing, AFP news agency reports. The Saudi authorities initially denied any involvement in the case, but later called it a \"rogue operation\". In December a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced five people to death and three to jail for Khashoggi's killing, but the trial was secretive and the defendants were not named. The CIA and some Western governments believe the murder was ordered by Crown Prince Salman - something he denies. The crown prince is de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia. UN special rapporteur Callamard says Khashoggi was \"the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible\". At the time of his death the 59-year-old worked for the Washington Post. The prosecutors have charged Ahmed al-Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani with \"instigating the deliberate and monstrous killing, causing torment\". Hatice Cengiz is hoping that the trial will reveal significant new evidence and finally reveal what happened to Khashoggi's remains.

{"title": "US Supreme Court rules against Trump on tax records but grants him temporary relief", "body": "The US Supreme Court on Thursday firmly rejected President Donald Trump's argument for sweeping presidential immunity and ruled that a New York prosecutor can obtain his financial records but prevented - at least for now - Democratic-led House of Representatives committees from getting similar documents. Both 7-2 rulings were authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts. The court made it clear that a sitting president cannot evade a criminal investigation, ruling that the subpoena issued to Trump's long-term accounting firm, Mazars LLP, for various financial records to be turned over to a grand jury as part of a criminal investigation can be enforced. But the court sidestepped a major ruling on whether three House committees could also obtain Trump financial documents under subpoena, giving Trump at least a short-term win. Litigation will now continue in lower courts in both cases. In both rulings, Roberts was joined by the four liberal justices as well as Trump's two conservative appointees to the court, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito both dissented. \"This is a tremendous victory for our nation's system of justice and its founding principle that no one - not even a president - is above the law,\" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, in relation to the ruling in his case. Vance and the House committees all issued subpoenas to third parties for the records, not the Republican president himself. Trump turned to Twitter complained about the rulings, writing on Twitter: \"Courts in the past have given 'broad deference'. BUT NOT ME!\" He added, \"This is all a political prosecution ... and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!\" The New York case ruling does not mean the documents will be handed over immediately because of expected wrangling in lower courts. A final outcome could be delayed in both cases until after the Nov. 3 election in which Trump is seeking a second term in office. \"We will now proceed to raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts,\" said Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal lawyer. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would not stop investigating Trump and would press forward in seeking to enforce the subpoenas. \"Congress's constitutional responsibility to uncover the truth continues, specifically related to the President's Russia connection that he is hiding,\" Pelosi said, in reference to the contention that Trump's financial records could show such an entanglement. Roberts rejected both the broad arguments for presidential immunity made by Trump's lawyers and the sweeping arguments made in favor of the House's ability to investigate the president. Trump's argument that he was immune from any criminal process \"runs up against the 200 years of precedent establishing that Presidents, and their official communications, are subject to judicial process,\" Roberts wrote in the New York case. \"We affirm that principle today and hold that the president is neither absolutely immune from state criminal subpoenas seeking his private papers nor entitled to a heightened standard of need,\" Roberts added. Roberts also rejected the suggestion that the decision would subject future presidents to harassment by local prosecutors, noting that the court in 1997 rejected a similar argument made by President Bill Clinton when he faced a civil lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, a woman who accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. \"Given these safeguards and the court's precedents, we cannot conclude that absolute immunity is necessary or appropriate,\" Roberts wrote. Roberts' analysis of the congressional subpoenas hinged on the competing political interests between different branches of government. \"Congressional subpoenas for the President's personal information implicate weighty concerns regarding the separation of powers,\" Roberts wrote. \"Neither side, however, identifies an approach that accounts for these concerns.\" Unlike other recent presidents, Trump has refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the Trump Organization. The content of these records has remained a persistent mystery even as he seeks re-election. House committees issued subpoenas seeking Trump's financial records from his longtime accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One. As part of a criminal investigation by Vance's office, subpoenas were issued to Mazars for financial records including nearly a decade of Trump's tax returns to be turned over to a grand jury in New York City. The investigation launched by Vance's office in 2018 into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with him, pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump and his aides have denied the relationships. In the litigation over the House subpoenas, Trump argued that Congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that disclosure of the material would compromise his and his family's privacy and distract him from his duties. In the New York case, Trump's lawyers argued that under the Constitution he is immune from any criminal proceeding while serving as president. In a lower court hearing, Trump's lawyers went so far as to argue that law enforcement officials would not have the power to investigate Trump even if he shot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue. The House Oversight Committee in April 2019 issued a subpoena to Mazars seeking eight years of accounting and other financial information in response to the congressional testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer. Cohen said Trump had inflated and deflated certain assets on financial statements between 2011 and 2013 in part to reduce his real estate taxes. The House Financial Services Committee has been examining possible money laundering in US property deals involving Trump. In a separate investigation, the House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether Trump's dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.

{"title": "Corsair Sabre V2 Pro: A featherweight contender for competitive gamers", "body": "How light is too light for a gaming mouse? Corsair's new Sabre V2 Pro Ultralight Wireless tries to answer that question. At 36 grams, it is among the lightest full-bodied wireless mice on the market. The design choice is deliberate — in fast shooters, every millisecond matters, and a lighter mouse promises swifter reactions. Pick it up and the weight (or the lack of it) is striking. The Sabre V2 Pro feels almost hollow, yet it carries a Marksman S sensor capable of 33,000 DPI and supports an 8,000 Hz polling rate. That specification is impressive, though the battery takes a hit. At the standard 1,000 Hz setting, Corsair claims up to 70 hours of life. Push it to 8,000 Hz, and that drops sharply to around 16 hours, according to The Verge. The shape is conventional, available in black or white, with two side buttons and optional grip tape for sweaty palms. Build quality feels solid despite the thin shell, but concerns about long-term durability remain. When hardware is pushed to this extreme, robustness is often the first casualty. Corsair has also shifted configuration away from heavy software. Instead, a browser-based tool allows quick tweaks to DPI and macros without clogging up storage. It is simple and effective, although currently limited to certain browsers. At a price of $100, the Sabre V2 Pro undercuts some rivals, but it still sits in the premium bracket. What buyers are paying for is the weight, or more accurately the absence of it. For competitive players chasing every advantage, this mouse offers real gains. For casual gamers, the trade-offs in battery life and potential fragility may feel less convincing. accessories / mouse / Corsair / Gaming", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/corsair-sabre-v2-pro-featherweight-contender-competitive-gamers-1240536", "date": "2025-09-20T01:25:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 20 September, 2025, 01:25 am Last modified: 20 September, 2025, 01:27 am", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 283, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:21:57.597124"}
{"title": "Between hope and heavy hearts: Inside the lives of Bangladesh's youth in 2025", "body": "In the cafés of Dhaka, in university dormitories, and across countless late-night group chats, one question keeps returning among young Bangladeshis: Are we falling behind, or is the system failing us? In 2025, youth in Bangladesh are living with a strange duality – energised by the moral ownership of the 2024 mass uprising, yet weighed down by a lingering post-revolution hangover marked by economic anxiety and slow institutional reform. Classrooms Full, Futures Unclear For many, the journey begins in overcrowded classrooms. While earning a degree remains the primary pathway to social mobility, the promise of higher education has rarely felt this fragile. Bangladesh's education budget continues to be a point of contention, hovering around 2% of GDP, far below the Unesco-recommended 6%. In the FY25 budget, education allocation stands at approximately 1.69% of GDP, one of the lowest rates in South Asia. This underinvestment has produced a persistent skills mismatch. According to the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), nearly 9,00,000 graduates – about one in three unemployed people – hold degrees that the labour market does not adequately value. Experts and civil society groups argue that current spending levels are insufficient to address structural gaps, improve teaching quality, or equip students with job-ready skills. in interviews, Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur has warned that Bangladesh risks squandering its demographic dividend if education reform fails to prioritise employability, analytical capacity, and critical thinking. For students, this warning is no abstraction – it is lived experience. Jobs that don't promise stability Graduation is now shadowed by sobering statistics. Unemployment among university graduates has reached around 13.5%, nearly four times the national average – creating a paradox where more education often means a higher risk of joblessness. Those who do find work frequently face short-term contracts, modest salaries, and long hours. Many others turn to freelancing, ride-sharing platforms, or online entrepreneurship. While these options offer short-term income, economists caution that the gig economy provides little protection against burnout, income shocks, or long-term insecurity. \"The world sees us as a 'freelancing powerhouse,' but they don't see the 3am shifts or the fear that an algorithm change could wipe out my income overnight. I earn in dollars, but I live in a bubble. I have 5,000 friends online—and no real conversation with a neighbour in weeks,\" said Siam, an independent graphic designer. Tanvir, an MBA graduate from Dhaka University, shares a similar frustration. \"I've applied for 42 jobs in six months. Every interview feels like a rehearsal for a role that's already been cast. People tell us to be patient – but patience doesn't pay internet bills or buy groceries. We aren't asking for handouts; we're asking for a fair game.\" As a result, major life decisions – marriage, home ownership, parenthood – are increasingly postponed. Not for lack of ambition, but because stability feels perpetually out of reach. The great migration debate Perhaps the most profound shift among Bangladeshi youth in 2025 is a redefinition of success. While government jobs and social prestige once dominated aspirations, many young people now prioritise mental peace, meaningful work, and work-life balance over titles. Experts argue this shift reflects global exposure rather than entitlement. In a hyper-connected world, youth are not only comparing salaries – they are comparing lives. This has created a quiet divide: those queuing for IELTS and GRE exams, and those determined to help build a \"New Bangladesh.\" The surge in students seeking foreign education and passports has become a silent vote of no confidence in domestic stability. For many, the ultimate \"cadre\" is no longer the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) position, but a boarding pass to Europe, North America, or Australia. Zarin, an engineering student preparing for study abroad, said, \"My heart is in Chawkbazar, but my career is in a folder labelled 'IELTS prep.' Leaving feels like betrayal; staying feels like slow academic suicide.\" Digital natives, real-world activists In 2025, activism in Bangladesh has moved beyond the streets. It has entered institutions. That shift became visible on 9 September 2025, when the Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu) elections were held after a long hiatus. Often described as the \"Second Parliament of Bangladesh,\" the polls recorded a historic 73% voter turnout, signalling a major shift in student political consciousness. For analysts, the Ducsu vote symbolised a deeper transformation – from protest to participation, from resistance to responsibility. Activism for today's students is no longer just about challenging power; it is about managing it. The 'post-uprising' mindset: Empowerment vs trauma The fall of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on 5 August last year, marked one of the most euphoric moments in Bangladesh's recent history. Young people – many at the forefront of the uprising – felt an unprecedented sense of ownership over the state. But by 2025, that euphoria has faded into what many describe as a post-uprising hangover. \"After 2024, we felt like we finally owned this country,\" said Nusrat, an undergraduate and activist. \"But ownership comes with a burden. Every bribe, every poorly built road feels like a personal failure. We're tired of being the country's conscience while our own futures remain on pause.\" A 2025 study found that over 67% of university students reported moderate to severe anxiety, with many showing symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress, particularly after witnessing the violence of the July Uprising. The revolution delivered freedom – but also expectations. Young people inherited responsibility for fixing a broken system, often without institutional support. The quiet weight of mental pressure Behind narratives of resilience lies a quieter crisis – unfolding in dorm rooms, bedrooms, and endless late-night scrolling. Psychiatrists across Bangladesh report rising cases of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among young people. Yet mental health remains deeply stigmatised, with many seeking help only when symptoms become severe. Professor Dr Helal Uddin Ahmed, head of the Department of Child, Adolescent and Family Psychiatry at the National Institute of Mental Health and Hospital (NIMH), has repeatedly warned that youth face overlapping pressures. In public discussions on youth mental health, he has pointed to family expectations, social comparison, and fear of failure as compounding stressors. Mental health professionals note that the political empowerment of 2024 did not automatically heal psychological trauma. Many young people are now navigating a difficult transition – from mobilisation to economic reality. According to Dr Ahmed's clinical assessment, this generation occupies a particularly fragile emotional state – oscillating between political agency and economic uncertainty. Social media further intensifies this vulnerability. Platforms that powered mobilisation in 2024 have increasingly become spaces of comparison in 2025. Constant exposure to curated success stories quietly erodes self-worth. Dr Ahmed has described today's youth as emotionally overstimulated but structurally unsupported – highly aware, constantly connected, yet lacking adequate mental health services and social safety nets. A generation worth listening to Bangladesh's youth are often labelled impatient, restless – even disruptive. But impatience today may simply be another name for honesty. This is a generation speaking plainly about pressure, inequality, and broken promises. They are anxious because the stakes are their entire lives. They are active because they have learned – often painfully – that silence allows decay. And they remain aspirational because they still believe change is possible. Whether Bangladesh can transform this anxiety into opportunity depends not on youth alone, but on institutions willing to listen, reform, and invest with equal urgency. The future is no longer approaching. It has already arrived, sitting in overcrowded classrooms, scrolling through glowing screens, and marching through city streets. The defining question is not whether Bangladesh's youth are ready for responsibility. They already carry it. The real question is whether the country is ready to keep pace with the generation it has raised.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/between-hope-and-heavy-hearts-inside-lives-bangladeshs-youth-2025-1323446", "date": "2025-12-31T19:00:00+06:00", "author": "Aditta Saha Niloy 31 December, 2025, 07:00 pm Last modified: 31 December, 2025, 06:57 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1279, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:21:59.866840"}

Of these, nine jute mills in Khulna region owed about Tk130 crore to 600 jute traders,\" the leaders of Khulna jute traders' association said at a press conference at the Khulna Press Club on Wednesday. The association declared an ultimatum to go for a tougher movement, including mass sit-in programme on the premises of the National Press Club and besieging BJMC, if their arrears dues are not paid. Leaders of the association said the government has treated the jute traders inhumanely by announcing the closure of the jute mills without any discussion with the traders about the payment of their dues. Prior to taking the decision, the government held several meetings with all concerned including the workers. But no discussion was held with the jute traders, who keep the wheels of the jute mills running by supplying jute, they claimed. The association said 580 traders of the Khulna region have become extremely frustrated over not getting any kind of promise for payment of arrears dues. Jute traders are doing business by taking loans from banks. Jute traders were frustrated for fear of losing capital, and the bank's pressure for repayment of loan installments. The leaders of the General Jute Traders' Association on July 12 sent a memorandum to the prime minister through the Khulna City Mayor and the deputy commissioner demanding payment of their arrears dues. Additionally, a memorandum will be given to the department concerned, including the Jute Minister, on July 19, seeking direct intervention of the prime minister.

US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco said her \"tentative view\" is to grant OpenAI's motion to dismiss xAI's lawsuit, pending oral arguments on 3 February. She also said tentatively that xAI could amend its claims if she dismissed its case. Lawyers for xAI and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk's startup sued OpenAI in September, accusing it of hiring xAI employees away to obtain confidential information related to the AI chatbot Grok. OpenAI, known for its ChatGPT chatbot, countered by accusing Musk of conducting a \"campaign to harass a competitor with unfounded legal claims\" because xAI could not keep up with ChatGPT. In a four-page filing outlining her thoughts, Lin said Musk's startup did not plausibly allege that OpenAI acquired or encouraged the theft of trade secrets, despite allegations that some former xAI employees downloaded source code before leaving. Lin also said it was not plausible to infer from xAI's complaint that OpenAI used xAI's trade secrets, or the former xAI employees used them on the job after joining OpenAI. The judge may also dismiss an unfair competition claim, saying xAI's poaching allegations \"all focus on poaching in service of acquiring xAI's trade secrets and do not identify any other reason why the hiring of those employees was anticompetitive.\" Lin asked xAI and OpenAI to address her tentative reasoning at the hearing. The lawsuit is part of a broader legal battle between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded and is also suing over its conversion to a for-profit company. Musk, the world's richest person, is seeking as much as $134.5 billion in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft in that case. Jury selection is scheduled for 27 April.

{"title": "Modi’s fuel-tax hikes are putting brakes on India’s recovery", "body": "Dilip Lamba, who owns a transport company in Jodhpur in western India, has had more than three-quarters of his fleet of 50 trucks idling for months. Dharampal Nambardar, a farmer who grows wheat and mustard seed in Haryana state, is worried he might not make any profit this year. The main source of their anxiety is not Covid-19, however, but rather a surge in fuel prices. The central government has hiked import and excise taxes twice this year even as it imposed the world's biggest coronavirus lockdown. Retail prices for diesel -- the lifeblood of India's economy -- in the capital New Delhi have jumped 30% since the end of April, while gasoline has risen 16%. \"Diesel makes up almost 70% of our operating costs,\" said Lamba, whose company carries everything from cotton to cement to leather goods all over India. \"Higher diesel prices means higher freight charges. But customers aren't ready for it and we can't absorb the costs.\" The central government raised levies on diesel and gasoline in March and then again in early May as the coronavirus battered the economy. There's been a staggering fivefold increase in taxes on diesel since 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, while those on gasoline have more than doubled. State governments also impose fuel levies, which in Delhi state account for around a quarter of the retail prices. Taxes on the two fuels now account for almost two-third's of what Indians pay at the pump, making Indian retail prices among the highest in Asia and almost double that in neighboring Pakistan. The recovery in global crude prices, meanwhile, has boosted Indian fuel costs even further in the last few months. The high prices are adding another headwind to an economy facing the biggest contraction in four decades. Diesel powers India's trucking fleet, which carries two-third of the country's freight, and is also essential for construction and agriculture. Gasoline, meanwhile, fills the tanks of millions of motorbikes ridden by lower-income Indians. \"While pump prices across the world have mostly followed the drop in oil prices since last year, India is an exception,\" said Senthil Kumaran, a senior oil analyst at industry consultant FGE. \"It's unusual to see such a steep increase in the taxes on diesel, as the fuel is deemed to be a driver of economic growth, especially in rural areas.\" There appears to be little chance that Prime Minister Modi will take steps to curb the rising diesel and gasoline prices even as global crude prices recover. This year's fuel levy increases are expected to generate about $30 billion a year in revenue for the government, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, at a time when coffers are being squeezed by less income and sales tax and higher spending on welfare programs. \"The tax hike in early May is turning into a wider cost-push supply shock, reinforced by a rebound in global crude oil prices,\" Abhishek Gupta, India economist at Bloomberg Economics, said in a note. That's likely to push up inflation over the next few months, he said. With industrial production still fragile as Covid-19 continues to spread in India, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan's prediction last month that fuel demand will be back to pre-virus levels by September is looking tough to achieve. There's already evidence that the high prices are curbing demand. Provisional fuel sales in June show that while India's overall consumption of petroleum products was 8% lower than a year earlier, diesel and gasoline consumption were down 15% and 14%, respectively. \"The cost of operations has increased exorbitantly and small truck operators are unable to pass it on to the consumers because demand is low,\" said Kultaran Singh Atwal, chairman of the All India Motor Transport Congress, the largest such grouping in the country. Almost half of India's truck fleet is still idle, he said.

{"title": "Tokyo to test snow machines for sweltering 2020 summer Olympics", "body": "In a bid to keep visitors cool in blistering temperatures expected during next year’s Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic games, organisers may deploy machines to sprinkle spectators with manmade snow. Artificial snow is the latest stratagem being considered to counter high humidity and summer temperatures that commonly exceed 30 degrees Celsius (86°F) in July and August, when the games are scheduled in the Japanese capital. A snow-making machine will be tried out at a test canoeing event on Sept. 13 in Tokyo, a spokesman for the games’ organising committee said. “We plan to produce two tonnes of snow in the test,” the spokesman added, but no immediate cost estimates were available. In 1964, when Tokyo last hosted the event, it opened in October. Since 1976, most summer games in the northern hemisphere have been held in the middle of summer to fit global broadcasting and sports schedules. Tokyo organisers have tried other measures, such as vapour sprays, shaded or air-conditioned rest areas and distribution of water and ice packs, at a beach volleyball test event in July. Officials measured the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which factors in temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, as rising as high as 31.7, exceeding a threshold of 31 at which Tokyo authorities urge citizens against exercise. To avoid the hottest part of the day, the marathons will start at 6 a.m., with major roads on much of the 26-mile (42 km) route surfaced with a resin-based material organisers say will reflect infrared rays to cut its temperature as much as 8 degrees C. Last month, heat concerns prompted the International Triathlon Union to shorten the distance of the run segment in a qualifying event in Tokyo for the July 24-Aug. 9 Olympics. Several days earlier, several athletes competing in the 2019 World Rowing Junior Championships were treated for heatstroke, media said.

{"title": "'Stop yelling', the accused officer shouted at George Floyd while strangling", "body": "The accused Minneapolis police officer of the murder of George Floyd's told him to stop talking as he repeatedly gasped under the man's knee, according to court documents. The unarmed black man cried out for his late mother and children as he said the Minneapolis policeman would kill him, transcripts from body-cam footage show, reports BBC. A full transcript of the exchanged words between two parties was disclosed in court by lawyers for one of the four officers involved. The documents offer the clearest picture yet of Floyd's last moments. His death in May sparked a global uproar. It led to a wave of anti-racism protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement and stirred debate and reflection in the US over the country's history of slavery and segregation. All four officers involved in taking Floyd into custody were fired and arrested. Derek Chauvin, who knelt on his neck, faces several charges including second-degree murder, while the other three - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - are charged with aiding and abetting murder. The transcripts were made public on Thursday as Lane's lawyers asked for the case against him to be dismissed. What do the transcripts show? Until now, eyewitness footage shared on social media revealed most of what was known about Floyd's arrest and his final moments. The new transcripts give a more detailed account, shedding light on significant parts of the encounter, from the time Lane and Kueng arrived at the scene, to the point where Floyd was given CPR in an ambulance. Transcripts of footage recorded by body cameras fitted to Lane and Kueng show Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers in a Minneapolis street. They confronted him outside a convenience store where he was suspected of having used a forged $20 note to buy cigarettes. At one point, a handcuffed Floyd, while pinned down on the road next to the police car, gasps that he cannot breathe, adding: \"You're going to kill me, man.\" Chauvin, who is shown in bystander footage appearing to kneel on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, replies: \"Then stop talking, stop yelling. \"It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.\" The transcripts show Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Lane asks Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. In response to one of the demands to see his hands, Floyd says: \"Man, I got, I got shot the same way, Mr Officer, before.\" It is not clear what he is referring to. At one point Lane says, \"Why's he getting all squirrelly and not showing us his hands and just being all weird like that?\" The officers then handcuff Floyd and try to put him into the back of their police car. As they do, Floyd becomes agitated, repeatedly pleading that he is claustrophobic. Lane asks if he is \"on something\". Floyd replies, \"I'm scared, man.\" According to another document, Lane told investigators that once in the car, Floyd began \"thrashing back and forth\" Officers then pulled him out of the car and to the ground. Pinned on the floor, according to the transcript, Floyd cries out a dozen times: \"Mama.\" He says, \"Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. \"Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead.\" At one point, when Floyd continues to plead he can't breathe, Lane asks Chauvin, \"Should we roll him on his side?\" The officer responds, \"No, he's staying put where we got him.\" Chauvin's lawyers have not commented on the documents since they were made public.

{"title": "July Museum highlights climax of 36 days, Hasina's misrule: Foreign Adviser", "body": "Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain today (3 February) said the July Mass Uprising Memorial Museum reflects the Bangladesh people's struggle against the misrule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. \"The museum showcases the climax of the 36 days of the July uprising, but it also highlights the elements of years of misrule,\" he said, adding that the true lesson of history is to ensure it is not repeated. The Foreign Adviser made the remarks as foreign diplomats stationed in Dhaka visited the museum on Monday, days before its opening to the public. Cultural Affairs Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki briefed the diplomats and guided them through the museum's key sections. Senior Secretary and SDGs Affairs Principal Coordinator Lamiya Morshed, Foreign Secretary Asad Alam Siam, and Cultural Affairs Secretary Md Mofidur Rahman were also present. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 29 January wrote to all diplomatic missions, UN agencies and offices of international organisations in Dhaka, inviting Ambassadors, High Commissioners, CDAs and heads of international organisations and UN agencies to join the museum tour, a senior official at the ministry told UNB. Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam and Deputy Press Secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumder have joined the programme. Earlier, on 20 January, Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus visited the museum. Gonobhaban, the former residence of 'ousted autocrat' Sheikh Hasina, has been converted into the July Museum, which is set for soft opening next week, said the Chief Adviser's press wing. At the start of a two-hour-long visit, the diplomats observed a minute of silence in memory of the nearly 4000 people who were martyred during the fascist regime of Sheikh Hasina. Farooki said the July Museum would collaborate with similar institutions in other countries. \"The idea behind the museum is to prevent the recurrence of such misrule, not only in Bangladesh, but anywhere in the world,\" he said. Chief Curator of the July Museum, Tanzim Wahab, described the various features of the museum to the visiting diplomats and guests. \"I am delighted to have visited the July Museum. It is both inspiring and a powerful reminder of how important it is to understand history, how mass uprisings occur, and the genesis of the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh,\" said Michael Miller, Ambassador and Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh.

{"title": "Trump says Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch likely part of US TikTok investor group", "body": "President Donald Trump said on Sunday that media mogul Lachlan Murdoch and business leaders Larry Ellison and Michael Dell would be involved as US investors in a proposed deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States. Trump has said that the US and China have made progress on a deal requiring TikTok's American assets to be transferred to US owners from China's ByteDance. The proposed investors would give Trump allies in corporate America influence over a widely popular social media app, which counts 170 million US users and helps shape public discourse on politics and culture. Trump praised the group in an interview with Fox News' \"The Sunday Briefing\" program, calling them prominent people and \"American patriots.\" \"I think they're going to do a really good job,\" Trump said, crediting TikTok with helping build his support among young voters in the 2024 presidential election. Murdoch, the CEO of Fox Corp, recently cemented long-term control of his family's media empire that includes Fox News and the Wall Street Journal after settling a years-long legal battle with his siblings. The family patriarch, 94-year-old Rupert Murdoch, may also be involved in the deal, Trump said. Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are known for their conservative views and their news outlets attract right-leaning audiences, but they have occasionally drawn Trump's ire. Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch for defamation over a July report that said Trump signed a 2003 birthday greeting for late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that included a sexually suggestive drawing and a reference to shared secrets. The newspaper has defended its reporting and vowed to fight the lawsuit. Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle and a major Republican donor, has long been linked to a potential TikTok deal. Dell is the CEO of Dell Technologies. The Trump administration has declined to enforce a US law enacted during the Biden administration requiring TikTok's divestiture over fears its US user data could be accessed by the Chinese government. Trump has included negotiations over the app as part of wide-ranging economic talks with China. The Trump administration has made a series of unusual interventions in US business, including taking a 10% stake in Intel Corp and allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15% of those sales. Trump has defended those moves as benefiting US interests. Critics, including some business leaders and Republican lawmakers, have called the interventions a stark departure from the norms of American capitalism and said they risk hurting the competitiveness of the US economy.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/usa/trump-says-rupert-and-lachlan-murdoch-likely-part-us-tiktok-investor-group-1242336", "date": "2025-09-21T23:25:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 21 September, 2025, 11:25 pm Last modified: 22 September, 2025, 12:15 am", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 428, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:22:31.494958"}

Within a gap of five months, the Forest Department found two dead tigers one in the Sundarbans West Andharmanki Forest Camp area and the other in Sundarban West Division area. The Forest Department sources said both the Royal Bengal Tigers died of old age reasons. However, earlier in May last year, the Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin said the number of Royal Bengal Tiger in Bangladesh part of the Sundarbans increased to 114 from 106. He made the announcement while unveiling a report on 'Second Phase Status of Tiger in Bangladesh Sundarbans 2018'. According to the information from Forest Department in between 2001 and July 2020, altogether 38 tigers died, 22 in East Division and 16 in West Division of the Sundarbans. Sources at the Forest Department said that some of the tigers died by poachers, some died in lynching, some passed away by storm and tidal surge while some died of old age. According to the latest Tiger Survey that was conducted in 2018, there were 114 tigers in the Sundarbans. However, the Forest Department could not ensure if the number remained the same or saw a decrease in 2020. Earlier on May 14, last year, a study by scientists of Bangladesh and Australia, warned that the Sundarbans' famed 'Royal Bengal Tigers' could be gone within 50 years, especially from the Bangladeshi part, because of constant rise in sea levels and climate change. The study was published in the journal Science of The Total Environment. About the recovery of the dead tiger on Friday last, Bashirul Al Mamun, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), West Sundarban, said the tiger was seen roaming around Andharmanik Forest Camp for the last few days. Later on Friday noon, it was found dead a few yards from the Forest Camp. It was a seven-feet long and three feet high 14-year old tigress, he added. DFO Bashirul Al Mamun, the tigress sustained injuries on her left leg and an autopsy was done by a veterinary doctor. He also informed that the skin and teeth of the tigress were reserved while the sample from the tigress was sent to Dhaka Forest Office for the true reason of the death. \"It'll be clear after a forensic study.\" Earlier on February 3, this year, some body parts of a tiger were recovered from Kaborkhali Canal in East Divisional Sundarbans, said DFO Muhammad Belayet Hossain adding that according to the forensic report, the tiger died of old age. DFO Hossain also informed that the government has taken different steps to protect tigers in the Sundarban. The sanctuary of the Sundarbans has been increased from 139,700 hectares to 317,900 hectares among the total of 601,700 hectares forest area, he informed. He also informed that the expansion of sanctuary in the Sundarbans, was launched in 2017 and a patrol team has been conducting smart patrolling regularly to ensure tigers' safety. According to the Forest Department of Sundarbans East Division, 22 tigers died in between 2001 and February 3, 2020 in that part of the forest. Among those, 10 were killed by miscreants, five were lynched, six died normally, and one tiger died during Cyclone Sidr in 2007. Skins of 16 tigers could be recovered among those 22, the sources said. Meanwhile, Sundarbans West Division sources said that between 2001 and 2020, 16 tigers died in this forest region. Among those, nine were lynched, and seven died from sickness and old age complications, the sources said. According to experts, each tiger occupies and identifies a total of 14 to 16 kilometers from its living station as its own territory but roams all over the forest. According to a census, Bangladesh Forest Department jointly with Wildteam and the Smithsonian Conservation Institute, USA, found that the number of Royal Bengal Tiger in Bangladesh part of the Sundarbans has increased to 114 from 106. The second phase census began on December 1, 2016 under the USAID (Bengal Tiger Conservation Activity (BAGH) project through camera trapping methods. The survey was conducted till 24th April, 2018 in 1656-sq km area of the Sundarbans in four phases. The total area was divided into three blocks -- Satkhira, Khulna and Sharankhola ranges. The cameras captured a total of 2,466 images during the 249-day census. The first-phase survey of the USAID BAGH project recorded 106 tigers in 2015.

{"title": "Covid-19 death toll lowest in a month", "body": "The country on Saturday recorded 29 deaths from the novel coronavirus, the lowest in a daily count in more than a month, while the tally of Covid-19 fatalities is approaching the grim milestone of 2,000. The first death from Covid-19 was reported on March 18 this year. The number of deaths crossed 100 over the following one month and it took another month to reach 500. Within the following fortnight, by June 10, the death tally doubled to 1,012. Between 8 am Friday and 8 am Saturday, 29 more people died of the disease, raising the death toll to 1,997. Of the deceased, 21 were men and 8 women. About 80 percent of them were above the age of 50 years. The death rate is 1.25 percent against the number of Covid-19 positive cases reported in the period, said Nasima Sultana, additional director general of the Directorate General of Health Services during a virtual briefing on Saturday. Saturday's death rate was the lowest since the first death on March 18. The death rate was as much as over 12 percent in March. It came down to 3 percent in April and hovered around 1.3 percent in June, thanks to a significant leap in the number of daily tests being conducted. Division-wise, Dhaka had the highest number of deaths, nine, in past 24 hours, followed by Rajshahi, seven, and Chattogram, four. The number of daily cases of infections across the country was up by about 5 percent to 3,288 from that of the previous day. The rate of infections against total tests was 22 percent over the last 24 hours, and the overall infection rate so far is 19 percent. Asked about the low death figure, Prof Ridwanur Rahman, former head of the medicine department of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, said, \"The actual scenario is not reflected in the daily counts of the infected and deaths due to the limited testing capacity.\" Many more have died at hospitals and their homes with Covid-19 symptoms but they were not tested, he said, adding that cases of infections would also be much higher than what is reported. According to Brigadier General Jamil Ahmed, director of administration of Kurmitola General Hospital, the number of deaths has dropped at the hospital because doctors have learnt how to better manage patients over time. \"The virus transmission is widespread now but the number of deaths is comparatively low,\" he said. Meanwhile, 2,673 people recovered from the disease during the past 24 hours, said Nasima Sultana of the DGHS. More than 70,000 people have recovered so far, with a recovery rate of 44.3 percent against the number of the infected. Before presenting the daily Covid-19 bulletin, Nasima Sultana spoke of psychological stress inflicted by health concern and economic insecurity amid the pandemic. The enforcement of social distancing keeps people away from loved and dear ones but their touch prompts \"our body to secrete hormones\" that gives the feeling of safety, satisfaction and inspiration. Prolonged social distancing may cause psychological separation and become a barrier to the psychological growth of children. Against this backdrop, Nasima emphasised the importance of showing empathy to children and elderly people and giving special care to them.

{"title": "AI is wiring the future of energy: Can Bangladesh catch up?", "body": "At COP30, the world's biggest names in energy and technology spoke like people already living in the future. For them, AI in power systems is no longer a distant idea. It is already running forecasts, balancing grids, operating virtual power plants, and helping companies achieve 24/7 clean electricity. From Schneider Electric to Google, everyone spoke about AI as if it were now a basic layer of modern energy systems. \"There is no AI without electricity,\" said Manish Pant, EVP of Schneider Electric, explaining how digital grids are becoming the backbone of clean power. Google's sustainability lead, Adam Elman, said the company already operates on 66% 24/7 carbon-free energy, with AI shifting computing loads hour by hour in response to renewable supply. Across the Global South, India is quickly emerging as a leader. Platforms like ElectronVibe work with more than 20 utilities to test AI tools that reduce outages, integrate renewables, and improve demand response. Their model--small pilots, open calls, and constant digital upgrades--is now being closely watched by other countries. The message from experts was clear: AI is becoming essential. It predicts solar and wind output, reduces losses, improves efficiency, helps data centres shift workloads, and allows utilities to plan upgrades faster and at lower cost. And then there is Bangladesh--a country only beginning to explore what others have already embraced. Officials admit the work is still at its earliest stages. As the global gap widens, Bangladesh risks falling behind. How AI helps — and why experts say it is now unavoidable At COP30, the conversation around AI in the power sector was striking not for its ambition, but for its practicality. AI is no longer an experiment; it is the new operating system of the energy world. Josh Parker of NVIDIA noted that AI is both a major consumer of energy and the most effective tool to reduce that consumption. \"In the past decade, AI inference efficiency has improved 100,000 times,\" he said. \"If car efficiency had improved that much, we'd drive to the moon and back on a gallon of fuel.\" NVIDIA's data centres, he explained, are now capable of reducing electricity and water use exponentially through AI-assisted optimisation. Google's Adam Elman described the company's carbon-intelligent load-shifting system, which uses AI to match computing tasks with renewable power availability: \"It automatically shifts jobs so we can make the best use of clean energy. During the European energy crisis, grid operators even asked us to reduce usage at peak times -- and AI made that possible.\" \"The only way to integrate renewables and manage resilience is through the digitalisation of the grid. Once you have the data, AI becomes the intelligence on top,\" Schneider Electric's Manish Pant explained from the utility perspective. The point was repeatedly emphasised that AI optimises not just power supply, but also demand, storage, predictive maintenance, and long-term planning. Professor Khondaker A. Mamun, PhD, Professor of AI at United International University and Founder of CMED Health, agrees that this shift is inevitable. \"AI allows us to operate the grid in real time, forecast faults, predict renewable fluctuations, and reduce wastage,\" he said. \"Countries that do not invest now will fall behind in efficiency, reliability, and cost competitiveness.\" For Bangladesh--where outages, system losses, and renewable curtailment remain persistent problems--Professor Mamun says the case for AI is not just strong, it is urgent. How other countries are doing it Kenya, undergoing one of the fastest renewable transitions in the world, now generates over 90% of its electricity from clean sources, supported by advanced forecasting systems. Chile uses Google X's Tapestry and DeepMind models to predict wind output 15% more accurately, reducing curtailment and improving dispatch. Brazil operates data-heavy, AI-enabled grids in São Paulo and Ceará, where solar-wind hybrid parks use machine learning for stability and forecasting. In India, utilities in Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Odisha are trialling AI-enabled outage prediction, digital substations, and ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management Systems). The government's AI for Impact programme has created a pipeline of AI-ready tools, ranging from virtual power plants to automated grid mapping. These examples demonstrate that, whether large or small, advanced or emerging, countries with AI-equipped power sectors are already enjoying higher efficiency and lower system costs. Where Bangladesh stands Bangladesh has only taken baby steps. \"We have launched a research project through MST to build an AI-based digital twin system for solar plants,\" said Dr Hasan Mahmud, Director of Innovation at the Bangladesh Energy and Power Research Council (BEPRC). The pilot will model a 200-kilowatt solar array and later validate it on the 7.5-megawatt Sirajganj solar facility. It is a start--but only that. Training programmes remain sporadic. \"We did a two-day workshop... beyond that I cannot say what the ministry is doing,\" said Wahid Hossain, Chairman of BEPRC. When contacted, Ershad Ahsan Habib, Director General (Additional Charge) of Power Cell, inquired about AI initiatives in the energy ministry and said he \"did not know\" of any structured effort to prepare the power sector for AI deployment. Attempts to reach the Power Division Advisor and Secretary were unsuccessful. Professor Mamun insists that Bangladesh does not need to invent anything new; it simply needs to build the same foundations that every successful AI-energy transition in the world has relied on. The first step, he says, is digitisation. \"AI cannot run on paper-based systems,\" he explained. For Bangladesh, that means a rapid push to install smart meters, upgrade SCADA networks, automate substations, and ensure real-time data collection across the grid. Once that digital backbone exists, the country must build what he calls a national energy data platform. Today, utilities guard fragmented datasets in isolated systems, making meaningful AI learning virtually impossible. \"You need a central energy data hub--anonymised but unified--before AI can learn anything meaningful,\" he said. Mamun believes Bangladesh should then begin with targeted pilot programmes, similar to India's ElectronVibe model. \"Start with three or four utilities, define problem statements, allow startups to propose AI models, and run controlled pilots,\" he said, adding that only real-world experimentation will show what works. The success of AI in the power sector depends heavily on people who know how to use it. Bangladesh needs trained engineers and officials across BPDB, PGCB, and the distribution companies; otherwise, even the best tools will fall short. As renewable energy grows, the grid must also be ready for the natural fluctuations of solar power. Strong forecasting systems and demand-response capabilities will be essential if the country wants to push renewable energy beyond the 15-20% mark. Finally, Bangladesh will need policy and procurement rules. At present, there is no framework--no standards, no guidelines, no cybersecurity rules. For Mamun, the message is simple. The longer Bangladesh waits, the harder the leap will become. \"AI is becoming the operating system of modern power grids. If Bangladesh waits too long, the gap will become too wide to catch up.\" AI / energy / Cop 30", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/ai-wiring-future-energy-can-bangladesh-catch-1317736", "date": "2025-12-24T11:00:00+06:00", "author": "Masum Billah 24 December, 2025, 11:00 am Last modified: 24 December, 2025, 11:05 am", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1144, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:22:46.060792"}

According to a report by the Herald Sun, the allegation appears in a draft email attributed to Epstein that surfaced after the US Department of Justice released around 3.5 million pages of material from the so-called \"Epstein files\" on Saturday. The disputed email, dated 2013, suggests that Gates had asked one of his advisers to arrange medication to deal with the alleged consequences of sexual encounters. Gates' representatives have categorically denied the claims, describing them as \"absurd and completely false\". A spokesperson for Gates said the allegation had no basis in fact and rejected any suggestion of misconduct. \"These claims are absolutely absurd and completely false,\" the spokesperson told the Daily Mail. The draft email reportedly appeared to be written by Epstein in the voice of Boris Nikolic, Gates' longtime science adviser, who was at the time signalling his intention to step away from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \"During the past few weeks I have been caught up in a severe marital dispute between Melinda and Bill,\" the email states, before alleging that Nikolic had been drawn into activities he later regretted. \" … In my role as his right hand, I had been asked on multiple occasions and in hindsight, wrongly acquiesced to participating in things that have ranged from the morally inappropriate to the ethically unsound and had been repeatedly asked to do other things that get near and potentially over the line into the illegal … \"From helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls, to facilitating his illicit trysts with married women, to being asked to provide adderall [for] bridge [tournaments]. I feel I owe it to my friends and future colleagues to admit a moral failure, to ask forgiveness, and to move on with my life.\" Gates' spokesperson, however, said the documents instead reflected Epstein's animosity towards the billionaire following the breakdown of their association. \"The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame,\" the spokesperson added. Despite the resurfacing controversy, Gates has been in Australia attending the Australian Open. He and his partner Paula Hurd were seen at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena on Friday, watching Australian pair John Peers and Olivia Gadecki secure their second consecutive mixed doubles title, before staying on for the men's semi-finals. Gates also attended the women's doubles final on Saturday. Gates has previously acknowledged that his association with Epstein was a serious error. In a 2021 interview with CNN, he said he deeply regretted the relationship. \"It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there … I made a mistake,\" he told interviewer Anderson Cooper.

French federation president Bernard Giudicelli told a news conference that on the main courts, a maximum of four people could sit together with an empty seat between groups. On the other courts, one seat out of two will be empty when the main tournament starts on Sept. 27. Giudicelli explained that it meant about 20,000 spectators are expected during the early stages of the two-week claycourt Grand Slam, and about 10,000 on the day of the final. Those numbers could change if the French government revises its social distancing rules. \"We went for the responsible option,\" said Giudicelli, who added that wearing a protective mask would be mandatory for people on the move inside the grounds while it would only be recommended for people sitting courtside. \"Should the situation evolve in the right direction, new tickets would be available in September,\" Giudicelli added. In case stricter measures would have to be imposed, there will be draw held to decide which tickets will be cancelled.

Moscow's Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, and the city's police force did not immediately respond to comment requests. Activists had planned a protest in central Moscow on July 15 advertised on social media as \"No to an eternal Putin\". A landslide vote this month handed Putin the right to run for two more presidential terms, an outcome the Kremlin described as a triumph. [nL8N2E82EI] Opposition activists say the vote was illegitimate, marred with violations, and that it's time for Putin, who has ruled Russia for over two decades as president or prime minister, to step down.

From July 1, 2019, household consumers will have to pay extra Tk175 per month, according to the new prices announced by the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) on Sunday. Users will have to pay Tk925 per month for a single-burner stove, the previous price of which was Tk750. For a double-burner stove, the price has been increased to Tk975 from Tk800. Earlier, seeking anonymity, a number of BERC officials said the gas tariff hike is going to be the highest till date, considering state-owned company Petrobangla’s rising expenses for expensive LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports. In the latest proposals, the gas companies wanted consumers to pay Tk1,350 per month for a single-burner stove instead of the existing Tk750, while a two-burner stove user would have to pay Tk1,440 per month, instead of Tk800 at present. For metered household consumers, the proposed price is Tk16.41 per cubic metre (one unit), instead of the existing Tk9.10. Petrobangla – which is responsible for exploring, producing and selling natural gas and other mineral resources – counts a monthly loss of almost Tk2,000 crore for importing LNG and selling the fuel at current prices on the local market. In January this year, Petrobangla and its associated gas marketing and distribution companies submitted their proposals to the BERC, seeking a rise in tariff for all kind of users. They sought minimum 50 percent to maximum 211 percent increase in gas tariffs. In March, the BERC held public hearings on the proposals.

{"title": "Messi surpasses Neymar as the top assist provider in international football", "body": "Lionel Messi has set another milestone in his illustrious career — becoming the all-time leader in assists in men's international football, surpassing Brazil's Neymar. The Argentina captain returned to action in the 6–0 friendly win over Puerto Rico after sitting out the previous match against Venezuela. Having played seven games for Inter Miami in just 27 days, Messi had been rested by the national team management. But this time, he told coach Lionel Scaloni he was ready. \"Yesterday I asked him if he was fit to play, and he said yes,\" Scaloni said after the match. \"It's always a joy for us when he says that.\" Messi didn't score in the match, but his creativity made the difference once again. In the first half, he set up Gonzalo Montiel for Argentina's opening goal — his 59th assist in international football, equalling Neymar's record. Then, in the 84th minute, he provided another assist, this time for Lautaro Martínez, to take his tally to 60 — the most by any player in history. After Messi and Neymar, the next best is former United States forward Landon Donovan with 58 assists. Hungary's Ferenc Puskás and Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne follow with 53 each, while another Hungarian legend, Sándor Kocsis, has 50. Brazil's Pelé registered 47 assists. Within Argentina's ranks, Messi's dominance is unmatched. Ángel Di María sits a distant second with 28 assists in 145 matches, followed by Diego Maradona with 26, Ariel Ortega with 21, and Juan Román Riquelme with 17. Messi has assisted Gonzalo Higuaín and Sergio Agüero nine times each — the most for any teammates — and Lautaro Martínez eight times. Venezuela have suffered most from Messi's playmaking, with six of his assists coming against them. He has also assisted five goals against Paraguay and four against Bolivia. Combining his club and international career, Messi now has 398 assists — just two short of the all-time record of 400 held by Ferenc Puskás. At 38, with his creative spark still burning, surpassing that mark seems inevitable. messi / Argentina Football Team / Assist", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/messi-surpasses-neymar-top-assist-provider-international-football-1261261", "date": "2025-10-15T15:35:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 15 October, 2025, 03:35 pm Last modified: 15 October, 2025, 03:40 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 344, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:23:01.943251"}

Speaking at a rally at Farabari High School ground in Thakurgaon, he said Jamaat leaders are making statements in talk shows, online platforms and newspapers but should first explain where they stood in 1971 and whose side they were on. Fakhrul alleged that Jamaat had assisted the Pakistani occupation forces and tried to obstruct Bangladesh's independence. He said there is no scope to forget 1971, just as people would not forget 2024 when the country regained its democratic system. Referring to his political future, Fakhrul said this might be his last election and pledged to establish an airport and a medical college in Thakurgaon, along with creating jobs. He said female voters in the district would be trained under the guidance of Tarique Rahman so they can earn from home. Fakhrul said: \"We must train our women and youth and create jobs by making them skilled and educated.\" He added that after 15 years, the country now has a real chance to hold a fair, free and credible election. The interim government and those elected through votes will form the government, which is their objective, he said, expressing hope for a historic and widely accepted poll if people vote spontaneously.

{"title": "How press freedom was built over centuries, how Bangladesh is watching it unravel", "body": "Last week, a mob attacked the offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, vandalising and looting their premises, and setting the former's building on fire with many journalists still trapped inside. But this was just a reiteration of the centuries-old practice of violence and intimidation against media organisations to silence them, not only in Bangladesh, but also globally. Press freedom, as the world has learned, is rarely lost in a single moment. It erodes until journalists begin to censor themselves, and mobs feel empowered to do the censoring on behalf of the state. Bangladesh is now standing at that edge. Yet the idea that journalists should be free to speak, question and investigate power is not modern, nor Western, nor accidental. It is one of humanity's longest political struggles, one that began not with newspapers, but with the belief that rulers themselves could be questioned. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel From fearless speech to printed truth Long before the printing press, Ancient Athens had a word for what democracies desperately need: parrhesia — fearless speech. It was not merely the right to speak, but the duty to tell the truth even when it was dangerous. Philosophers understood that a society without parrhesia rotted from within. That idea clashed with power when Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in the 1440s. For the first time, ideas could travel faster than authority. Both Church and State responded instinctively: licensing, censorship, and official approval stamps became prerequisites for printing. Knowledge, once liberated, was chained again. Resistance came in 1644, when English poet John Milton published 'Areopagitica', a blistering attack on censorship. Milton argued that truth does not need protection; it needs competition. Let truth and falsehood grapple freely, he wrote, and truth will prevail. This idea later became known as the \"marketplace of ideas\", a principle still central to modern press freedom. But an idea alone could not protect printers from prison. England's press did not become free through a grand declaration. In 1695, the Licensing Act, the law that allowed the state to censor publications, simply lapsed. Parliament chose not to renew it. Overnight, the press became free by omission, not protection. There was no shield, only the absence of chains. That absence mattered. It showed the world that speech could survive without permission. Still, none of this would have been possible without an earlier, almost accidental foundation: the Magna Carta of 1215. Often misunderstood as a free speech document, it said nothing about expression. What it did establish was far more dangerous to power — the rule of law. Clause 39 declared that no one, not even the King, could imprison or punish without due process. For the first time, authority had limits. Without that idea, no journalist could ever be safe. A ruler could simply lock critics away. Magna Carta planted the psychological seed that rights exist independently of rulers, a seed that later grew into press freedom. Turning privilege into law The true breakthrough came in Sweden in 1766. While other European nations tolerated press freedom in practice, Sweden enshrined it in law. The Swedish Freedom of the Press Act, largely crafted by Finnish priest and parliamentarian Anders Chydenius, did two radical things. First, it abolished pre-publication censorship entirely. Second, it introduced a revolutionary principle known as \"offentlighetsprincipen\" — the right of public access to government documents. Press freedom was no longer just the right to publish; it was the right to know. This transformed journalism into a structural check on corruption. For the first time, the state was legally obliged to open its files to scrutiny. Let us commend the ability of the media's enemies to constantly renew the nature of their attacks against journalism. Thibaut Bruttin, RSF Director-General Twenty-five years later, the United States adopted a different but equally powerful model. The First Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1791, did not grant rights; it restrained government. \"Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\" This concept of \"negative liberty\" placed the burden permanently on the state to justify any restriction. Its spirit was born earlier, in 1735, during the trial of printer John Peter Zenger. Accused of seditious libel for criticising a colonial governor, Zenger's lawyer made a radical argument: truth should be a defence. The jury agreed. A cultural expectation was born, and power could be criticised if the criticism was true. Freedom of speech did not stop at newspapers. Democracies built a final safety valve inside their legislatures. The English Bill of Rights of 1689 established parliamentary privilege, absolute freedom of speech inside Parliament. Article 9 ensured that debates in Parliament could not be questioned in any court. This followed centuries of monarchs arresting MPs for dissent, including King Charles I storming the House of Commons in 1642. Today, this absolute privilege means MPs cannot be sued or arrested for what they say in the chamber. It creates a crucial loophole for press freedom. If a journalist cannot publish an allegation without risking defamation, but an MP raises it in Parliament, it becomes public record. The press can then report it under qualified privilege. There is one strict rule though: step outside the chamber and repeat the allegation, and the protection vanishes. The system forces responsibility while ensuring one place where truth can always be spoken. The world formally recognised all of this only after the catastrophe. In 1948, scarred by the propaganda and censorship of the Second World War, nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 declared freedom of expression a universal right, valid through any media and regardless of frontiers. The corruption connection The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), published by Transparency International, measures how corrupt a country is perceived to be. Reporters Without Borders' Press Freedom Index measures how free journalists are. When the two are compared, a pattern emerges. At the top of the press freedom rankings sit Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, all among the cleanest countries in the world, with CPI scores ranging from 82 to 90. In these nations, corruption is high-risk. A minister misuses public funds, and a newspaper publishes receipts the next day. Resignations follow swiftly. At the bottom are North Korea, Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan, countries where press freedom is nearly nonexistent, and corruption scores plunge as low as 11 out of 100. There, corruption is low-risk. Journalists who ask questions are imprisoned. State media simply do not report theft. The mechanism is simple: where journalists are protected, corruption becomes dangerous. Where journalists are silenced, corruption flourishes. There is one famous exception, Singapore. With a CPI score of 83, it remains remarkably clean despite ranking poorly on press freedom. It achieves this not through scrutiny, but through extremely high government salaries and a powerful anti-corruption bureau. For most of the world, such an alternative does not exist. The press is the only watchdog. Naming the predators Reporters Without Borders continues to name what it calls the \"predators of press freedom\". \"Let us commend the ability of the media's enemies to constantly renew the nature of their attacks against journalism,\" RSF Director-General Thibaut Bruttin said earlier this year. \"While some politicians throttle reliable information, other predators murder or imprison journalists, while yet others manipulate media funding or use legal action to silence reporters… impunity is not inevitable,\" Bruttin added. The 2025 list includes the Chinese Communist Party under Xi Jinping, Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Israel's Defence Forces are listed for the deaths of nearly 220 journalists under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Myanmar's State Peace and Security Commission and Burkina Faso's military junta appear alongside Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel. The list also reflects new tactics. Technology has become a weapon. Xi Jinping uses state-aligned chatbots for propaganda. Elon Musk's X has been used to harass journalists. The IDF conducts online smear campaigns. In India, the Hindu nationalist site OpIndia has intensified disinformation and harassment against critical reporters. Predators no longer rely only on prisons. They use platforms, courts and mobs. Bangladesh's long descent into press censorship Bangladesh knows this pattern well. Sheikh Hasina, prime minister from January 2009 until her ouster, has been listed by RSF as a predator of press freedom since at least 2014. The irony is bitter. As the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the nation's founding leader, she once stood against regimes that persecuted journalists. Once in power, she reversed course. Her consolidation of authority accelerated after the 2014 election, when opposition parties were denied access to the media. Criticism became intolerable. The Digital Security Act of 2018 completed the legal architecture of fear. Vaguely worded, it criminalised online content \"liable to disturb public order\" with up to seven years in prison, and imposed 14 years for \"negative propaganda\" against the Father of the Nation. The law rendered entire subjects untouchable. In its first two years, around 400 people were prosecuted under the DSA, including more than 70 journalists and bloggers. Prison conditions were so dire that writer Mushtaq Ahmed died in custody in February 2021. Enforcement did not rely solely on the police. Supporters of the Awami League and its student wing, the Chhatra League, became street-level enforcers, attacking reporters, blocking coverage of protests, and turning elections into hostile zones for the press. Some journalists ended up in the hospital. Some never came home. By 2021, Bangladesh ranked 152nd out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index. The danger now is that repression has outlived its architect. As legal protections collapse and trust in institutions erodes, mobs have begun to replace the state as arbiters of acceptable speech. Newsrooms are vandalised not by law, but by outrage. Journalists are threatened not through court summons, but through chants, fists and social media posts and messages. This is what happens when press freedom is weakened for too long. The watchdog is first leashed, then blamed for not barking, and finally attacked for existing at all. History shows where this leads. Societies without fearless speech become opaque. Corruption does not vanish; it goes underground. Power stops explaining itself. Truth becomes dangerous again. But this was just a reiteration of the centuries-old practice of violence and intimidation against media organisations to silence them, not only in Bangladesh, but also globally.

Newsrooms are vandalised not by law, but by outrage. Journalists are threatened not through court summons, but through chants, fists and social media posts and messages. This is what happens when press freedom is weakened for too long. The watchdog is first leashed, then blamed for not barking, and finally attacked for existing at all. History shows where this leads. Societies without fearless speech become opaque. Corruption does not vanish; it goes underground. Power stops explaining itself. Truth becomes dangerous again.

{"title": "Winter’s 100-mile trek: Palashbari’s date sap collectors and their timeless craft", "body": "Between two rivers – the Madhumati on one side and the Nabaganga on the other – lies Palashbari, a quiet village in Mohammadpur upazila of Magura. For most of the year, it attracts little attention. But as winter sets in, Palashbari becomes a place of seasonal fascination. The reason is simple: fresh date palm sap and the pure jaggery made from it. A narrow road cuts through the village, lined with nearly 500 date palm trees in neat rows. From dawn to dusk, people queue for fresh sap, which is used to make winter delicacies such as pitha, payesh, and kheer. Artisans also boil it into liquid and solid jaggery, locally called \"jhola\" and \"patali gur\". Much of this production travels far beyond the village, sent to friends and relatives across Bangladesh and even abroad. What makes Palashbari unusual is that the skilled jaggery makers – the gachhis – are not locals. Every winter, they travel almost 100 miles from Bagha upazila in Rajshahi, building temporary shelters to settle in the village for four months. For nearly nine years, their seasonal lives have revolved entirely around Palashbari's date palms. It all began 9 years ago The story began nearly nine years ago with Daud Hossain Molla, a resident of Palashbari who was then working in Rajshahi. Watching sap collectors, or gachhis, climb date palm trees, he was reminded of the untapped trees in his own village. On impulse, he invited a few to visit Palashbari. Among them was Hafizur Rahman, an experienced gachhi from Bagha who had been harvesting sap since he was 10. Struck by the abundance of trees and the warmth of the villagers, Hafizur established a long-term connection with the village. In Rajshahi, jaggery prices were low, pushing him to seek work elsewhere. Magura, by contrast, offered higher demand and better returns, making Palashbari an ideal winter base. This season, five gachhis are working in two teams, with Hafizur leading three of them. Arriving at the start of Kartik, the seventh month of the Bangla calendar when winter starts making its advent, they spent weeks cleaning and preparing the trees. Renting a modest home on the village outskirts, they plan to return after Magh. Their days begin before dawn. In bitter cold, they climb the trees to collect sap, which is then boiled into jaggery. Afternoons are spent preparing the trees for evening sap flow, while nights see villagers gathering for fresh sap, prompting another round of collection. Hafizur's team manages around 320 trees, divided into two groups, each tapped 3 days a week with alternating rest, ensuring sustainable yields throughout the season. Sap sells faster than it flows As the sun climbs past its zenith, the boiling pans of jaggery are in full swing, while a steady stream of customers arrives. Many, however, leave empty-handed, demand is so high that the jaggery often sells before it has even solidified. \"You have to place your order at least a week in advance,\" Hafizur says, stirring the amber liquid. His success has inspired others, including Mohammad Aftab, who moved to the other side of the village two years ago to manage his own set of trees. Aftab explains that keeping up with local demand is a constant challenge, let alone fulfilling orders from across the country and abroad. \"Expatriates crave the authentic taste of home. One recent order was 60 killograms (kgs) for overseas delivery. Orders like that come nearly every day, but we cannot meet them all.\" Among the customers is Hanif Hossain, a businessman from Dhaka, who has ordered 13kgs of patali gur for friends. Jaggery or sap: A difficult choice Fresh sap sells fast – Tk70 per litre in the morning and evening. The rush is such that jaggery production is increasingly squeezed. Selling sap is more profitable, Aftab explains. Jaggery requires extra labour, fuel and time. As a result, many gachhis are leaning towards sap sales, and jaggery output is slowly declining. Still, the gachhis say Palashbari remains a profitable place to work. Whether sap or jaggery, winter here delivers steady income. A sweet deal for all For each tree, the gachhis give the owner 2kgs of jaggery, though some owners prefer raw sap. Whatever remains belongs to the gachhis. Aftab says earnings from sap and jaggery during the four winter months provide a decent income. In summer, he invests in mango orchards, returning to Palashbari when winter comes again. This season, Aftab and his assistant manage 120 trees, producing 18 to 20kgs of jaggery daily from half of them – enough to meet most local demand. They feel their day-and-night labour is well rewarded. Tree owners are equally satisfied. Daud notes that for nearly nine years, the gachhis have worked in the village without dispute. \"We don't take money. They give us sap and jaggery for pitha and payesh, which we share with relatives. We're happy – they earn, and we get jaggery,\" he says. Many trees once lay unused, but with Hafizur and Aftab's arrival, sap flows again. Van driver Mohammad Shahjahan Molla recalls, \"Outsiders revived these trees, and now Palashbari is famous across Magura.\" Call to grow more date palm trees At Mohammadpur bazaar, stalls overflow with jaggery priced from Tk150 per kg. Local buyers complain that much of it is adulterated – its colour, texture and taste give it away. By contrast, pure Palashbari jaggery sells for Tk400 to Tk450 per kg. Though expensive, conscious consumers are willing to pay for authenticity, but for many, the price remains prohibitive. Van driver Shahjahan Molla recalls when good jaggery was cheaper. \"There were more trees and workers. Now fuel shortages, lack of skilled gachhis, and neglect have led to tree felling. Jaggery has become scarce, and adulteration dominates the market.\" Magura and the southern region were once famous for date palm jaggery, but declining tree numbers and a shortage of labour have pushed prices up. To preserve the tradition, villagers are planting new saplings. Young entrepreneurs like Hasib Sheikh, who sells jaggery online, are revitalising the market. \"If the trees grow, sap will flow – and if there is sap, there will be jaggery,\" he says.

{"title": "What about those who have symptoms yet not testing?", "body": "Ever since Anju Monoara – a woman living in Kazipara, Dhaka – was diagnosed with Beta Thalassemia around two years ago, her body temperature sometimes increases. Usually, the rising temperature is a sign of decrease in Anju's blood haemoglobin level. About two weeks ago, the 36-year-old woman had a fever, at a time when the Mirpur area was dotted with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the capital. Her family promptly separated her from others at home. By the fifth day, she began suffering from a loss of smell and shortness of breath, sending out an alarm. Her husband considered taking her to one of the kiosks set up at different points in the capital to collect samples for Covid-19 tests, or the labs that have been carrying out Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests for identifying novel coronavirus cases. But, what if Anju had not contracted the virus? Why put her at a higher risk of getting the infection while standing in long queues for hours to provide her sample? Anju stayed home and consulted a doctor. The physician also discouraged her from going through the hassle of being tested because of the delay in obtaining results, and prescribed treatment right away. She had a cough on the eleventh day, but she felt less fatigued and an inhaler helped ease her breathlessness by that time. Inadequate data for pandemic projections Like Anju, an increasing number of people – who remain undocumented – are taking medications for Covid-19 symptoms, but are not getting tested. There are realities that have brought this into practice. Doctors in and outside Dhaka say it takes five to ten days to get results. In one of the recent instances, a person named Mainul Islam gave his sample at Barguna District Hospital on June 5 and his report came out on June 12. The result returned negative, but he needed oxygen support for days before he recovered and went home. Amid the rush of suspected Covid-19 patients, samples pile up at the PCR labs, sent from upazila and district-level hospitals. Some lots end up being discarded because their quality deteriorates and healthcare providers try to work their way back – searching for the suspected patients to collect samples again and transport those to the labs for retesting. Meanwhile, patients, if not admitted to a hospital, might be spreading the novel coronavirus infection in their communities. This is the backdrop against which clinicians are suggesting isolation and treatment with the onset of the signs because the country has already stepped into the fourth stage of the pandemic – when the infection is widespread. Such a scenario brings into question how accurate the infection curve is, drawn from the 24-hour-cycle health bulletin by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), based on PCR test results. M Mushtuq Husain, an adviser to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), said separate data should be recorded of suspected Covid-19 patients identified with symptoms and by alternative medical means like an X-ray. And these numbers should be incorporated in the health bulletin to help understand the magnitude of the pandemic in the country. \"The partial picture that is portrayed by the partial data,\" as epidemiologist Kinkar Ghosh of Dhaka Shishu Hospital said, \"makes the infection curve unpredictable.\" Asked if increasing the testing capacity might fix the anomalies, Mushtuq said unless and until the virus transmission is contained, \"it does not matter how much we intensify the testing – it will not reap any benefit.\" Tests lose purpose To contain the transmission, doctors or healthcare providers must follow up on every patient who has tested positive, isolate the person and trace their contacts to make sure they stay in quarantine. If any of the contacts begins showing symptoms, they should be tested too. \"The IEDCR had been doing all of this until April when the DGHS took over the job. That was followed by a significant leap in the number of tests being conducted every day, but the health directorate could not reach patients in many cases, let alone trace their contacts,\" said Mushtuq. Contact tracing is a rigorous procedure and requires manpower. At the Shishu Hospital, four of the five people involved in the process fell sick with Covid-19. The hospital's lab takes no more than 50 samples from the children's facility because it has to test samples from other private and public hospitals as well as from outside Dhaka including Brahmanbaria, Cumilla and Munshiganj. Moreover, many hospitals refer patients to the facility for a Covid-19 test before emergency medical procedures – a heart operation, for example. On June 21, of seven outpatients from whom samples were taken, five needed urgent medical attention that depended on the test results. About 35 percent of the children being tested come out as asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. The Shishu Hospital had already stopped tracing contacts of outpatients because it was burdensome on the existing manpower. Now, tracing contacts of the inpatients has also become an uphill task. With the mounting pressure for tests, doctors counsel guardians – especially mothers – to stay home with their children, isolated.

{"title": "Republicans face election risks in clash with gun rights groups over protester's killing", "body": "Trump administration officials' suggestion that Alex Pretti should not have brought a legally carried handgun to a Minneapolis protest has opened a rare rift with gun rights groups, creating election-year risks for Republicans with one of their most loyal voting blocs. Several of President Donald Trump's officials drew swift pushback from gun rights groups for their stance after Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, was shot dead by federal agents on Saturday. Pretti had a license to carry a concealed weapon, and the Minneapolis police chief said he has seen no evidence that Pretti brandished the weapon before he was shot multiple times. In defense of the agents, Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official, all said Pretti should not have been carrying a gun. \"You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple,\" Patel said on Fox News on Sunday. Gun rights groups, including the politically influential National Rifle Association, however, countered that Pretti had simply been exercising his right to carry a firearm in public. They argued that the administration's suggestion that his right to carry a gun depends on the setting - and does not extend to protests - runs against a bedrock principle of conservative politics: the right to keep and bear arms. The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus called Patel's comments \"completely incorrect on Minnesota law.\" Another issue for disgruntled voters Bryan Strawser, the group's chairman and a Republican, told Reuters the administration was backtracking on the Second Amendment - the constitutional right to keep and bear arms - and that could hurt his party going into the November midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Voters are already disgruntled over the cost of living and high healthcare costs, and a rising number, including some Republicans, are growing increasingly unhappy with the aggressive tactics being used in Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown. \"It's unbelievably stupid that they've chosen to alienate the gun lobby. The NRA and the gun lobby have basically been a bedrock constituency of the Republican Party for 50 years,\" said Jacob Perry, a Republican strategist based in Florida. Gun rights groups are major donors to Republican political campaigns, are effective in turning out supporters, and their members are reliable voters. Asked by a reporter on Monday if Trump believes Americans have a right to carry a gun while protesting, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to suggest that right did not extend to events involving armed law enforcement. \"Any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms, and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk and the risk of force being used against you, and that's unfortunately what took place on Saturday,\" Leavitt said. The NRA on social media on Monday referred to Leavitt's comments, saying that while law-abiding Americans had a constitutional right to carry guns, they did not have a right to \"impede lawful immigration enforcement operations.\" Gun rights rooted in US origin story Verified videos reviewed by Reuters show Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as he filmed federal agents pushing protesters to the ground. After stepping between an agent and two women, Pretti was pepper-sprayed, subdued, and pinned to the ground. Footage then appears to show an agent removing a handgun from Pretti's waistband. Moments later, an officer shot Pretti four times in the back, with additional shots fired by other agents. While avoiding direct criticism of Trump, Gun Owners of America and the NRA instead targeted comments by Bill Essayli, a Trump‑appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, who wrote on social media that \"if you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.\" The NRA called his remarks \"dangerous and wrong.\" The lobbying organization, which has been closely aligned with Trump, did not respond to a request for comment. Luis Valdes, a GOA spokesman, said, \"Our stance is very simple. We will defend the Second Amendment, no ifs, ands or buts.\" Guns and gun rights are wrapped up in the American origin story, rooted in a frontier mentality, a resistance to tyranny, and independence. Yet it wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that gun rights became a hot-button political cultural issue. Political assassinations in 1968, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and US Senator and Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, led to the 1968 Gun Control Act, which banned gun sales to certain groups, including felons and drug users, and required the federal licensing of gun dealers. It triggered a backlash among conservatives, who saw the law as government overreach. In 1977, NRA leadership changed from mostly gun club members to hardline political activists, bringing about the birth of the modern gun-rights movement. Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican consultant, said gun owners are a reliable Republican bloc and take seriously their Second Amendment rights. \"This could have ramifications in the midterms if Second Amendment groups feel their constitutional rights are under attack by the Trump administration,\" she said. Conservatives have often brought weapons to protests. Among them was Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted on charges of killing two people and wounding another during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin. He was lauded by conservatives and later met with Trump. \"Carry everywhere. It is your right,\" Rittenhouse posted on X on Monday.

{"title": "Solshare backs businesses by sharing solar energy", "body": "Bimal Das, a dispensary owner in a remote area of Patuakhali in Barishal, used to light his house with kerosene-fueled lamps. But now his house has electricity through Solshare, a start-up that helps rural Bangladeshis owning home solar power systems trade their surplus electricity with their neighbours. Recently, he earned Tk2,000 by selling electricity to his neighbours from the solar panel installed in his house. The money brought him enormous joy during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that left businesses in tatters and led to a financial crisis worldwide. Not only Bimal, but households across different remote rural areas in Bangladesh are also making money from their solar home system (SHS) besides enjoying affordable electricity. Solshare's idea of making money by sharing excess power of the SHS has got a tremendous response both in Bangladesh and abroad as the start-up recently won the Ashden Award 2020, an international award for climate change innovation. The SHS is not a new thing for electrification in off-grid or remote areas. Bangladesh is one of the world leaders in solar home systems with more than five million units now in place. Salma Islam, a project manager at Solshare, said: \"The uniqueness of our programme is that we have created a device that enables people to share their excess energy, and help them make money.\" \"In conventional solar home systems, people used to waste around 30 percent of the energy during the peak daylight hour. But our device reduced the waste by helping them share the extra energy,\" she added. How energy is shared in Solshare In a normal solar home system, each system has a panel and a battery to store the energy harnessed from sunlight. The system wastes the energy once the battery is full and there is no use. On the other hand, in Solshare system, each household has to set up a Solbox is a bidirectional IoT (Internet of Things) smart metre alongside the panel and battery to be connected to a microgrid. Using this electronic metre, the owner can transfer excess energy to a local microgrid that other Solshare users are part of, allowing those who need more power to buy it, and thus reduce waste. Solbox has three modes – buy, sell and auto. Salma said, \"If someone puts the device in auto mode, it will automatically start selling energy once the battery is full.\" The technology interconnects households and microbusinesses with and without solar home systems, allowing users the freedom to use energy as a producer, prosumer or consumer. \"A household that cannot afford the solar home system can also enjoy electricity through Solbox,\" Salma said. Currently, there are 659 Solboxes in 30 operational microgrids, including two in Assam, India. The system has helped improve livelihoods through greater economic returns, increased resilience and creating alternative income-generating opportunities, Salma added. Difference between mini-grid and Solshare's P2P grid Currently, there are around 26 solar mini-grids in different off-grid areas across the country. Infrastructure Development Company Ltd and other organisations have implemented these projects with the help of the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority, an entity of the Power Division. These grids also distribute electricity to marginalised people in remote char and island areas. Salma told The Business Standard that their system is decentralised. \"On the other hand, mini-grids are centralised where electricity comes from a single source and the money is going out of the community. But in our system, a household owns the solar panel and the money stays in the community if they trade their additional energy with their neighbours,\" she explained. She further said that Solshare has an area manager and engineer in each micro-grid who are from that particular community. With Solshare's swarm electrification approach, villagers become solar entrepreneurs and earn money, she added. Solshare officials said the company is aiming to spread the model across the country on a larger scale. They said the company hopes to expand their model to allow at least 100,000 Bangladeshis to share solar power over the next five years. The company is also in talks with a US-based international organisation to set up similar microgrids in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar. As part of the plan, it has also engaged with the Bangladesh government regarding an on-grid energy supply, where Solshare will be empowered to bundle individual solar home systems and sell this power to the national grid.

{"title": "How Intel's Nvidia deal could help Intel's next generation of chip manufacturing", "body": "Nvidia's deal with Intel could put the struggling chipmaker's next-generation manufacturing technology on a stronger footing, even without a direct commitment from the AI chip leader to use that technology to make its own chips, analysts said. Nvidia yesterday (18 September) invested $5 billion in Intel for a stake of roughly 4% and the two firms agreed to a deal to supply chips to one another to create \"multiple generations\" of joint products. Those products will connect Intel's central processors and Nvidia's artificial intelligence and graphics chips with a speedy and proprietary Nvidia connection technology called NVLink. Any relationship with Nvidia at this point, while not explicitly talking about the foundry services, should be seen as a possible extension of the partnership in the future Jack Gold, principal analyst with J.Gold Associates This could give Intel a leg up against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) because its chips will be attached to Nvidia's flagship products in a way that no other third-party chips currently are, analysts said.

Nvidia, AMD to pay 15% of China chip sale revenues to US: official This is significant for both because Intel does not always use its own factories to craft its own chip design, often relying on TSMC just as Nvidia does. But if Intel supplies the chips for the joint products and they prove to be popular, the partnership could help provide the production volumes that Intel needs to make its manufacturing investments viable, analysts said. \"It gives me a higher degree of confidence that 14A continues, at which point Intel should have very good returns\" on its 14A investments, said Ben Bajarin, CEO of technology consulting firm Creative Strategies.

Any relationship with Nvidia at this point, while not explicitly talking about the foundry services, should be seen as a possible extension of the partnership in the future This could give Intel a leg up against rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) because its chips will be attached to Nvidia's flagship products in a way that no other third-party chips currently are, analysts said.

{"title": "Ongoing floods: Kurigram fish farmers incur about Tk2 crore loss", "body": "Fish farmers in Kurigram district have lost an estimated Tk2 crore worth of fish from 531 ponds owned by 433 farmers that have been washed away and damaged by floods. District Fisheries officials said floods washed away 107.89 tonnes of fish worth Tk1.69 crore and 26.09 lakh fry worth Tk18.44 lakh in the district. Additionally, structures surrounding the ponds were damaged by the floodwater. The total loss for farmers, including damage to ponds and fish, is approximately Tk1.98 crore, they added. Fish farmers of all nine upazilas of the district were affected by the floods. Of those, Sadar upazila was the worst affected area. In Sadar, fish from 396 ponds belonging to 302 farmers were washed away by floods. Besides, floodwater washed away structures surrounding the ponds. The total loss is estimated at Tk1.5 crore. Farmers said this damage could have been prevented if the Fisheries Department had carried out an awareness campaign before the floods. Refuting the allegation, District Fisheries Department officials said they had carried out a proper campaign about taking necessary steps to protect fishponds before the floods. Taizul Islam, a farmer of Sadar Upazila, said he released fry worth Tk24,000 in two ponds on one acre of land. A week ago, the hyacinth floating in the flood waters of the Dharla river tore out the nets planted around the ponds and the fish were washed away. \"Many farmers could have saved their fish if the fisheries department had campaigned before the floods. However, I could not save the fish even after erecting the nets,\" he said. Sohrab Ali, a fish farmer of Sadar Upazila, said, \"I released fry worth Tk1 lakh in an acre of pond. One week ago, the pond was washed away by the floods of the Brahmaputra river.\" Abdul Latif Sarkar, farmer of Ulipur Upazila, said the banks of two ponds on 40 acres of land have collapsed and almost all the fish have washed away. The pond has to be renovated for fish farming again. Senior Upazila Fisheries Officer Ismat Ara of Kurigram Sadar said, \"During the inspection, I noticed a huge loss by fish farmers. In this upazila, fish from 396 ponds were washed away by floods. The total loss of the farmers is estimated at Tk1.5 crore.\" \"To recover the loss, the farmers were advised to release the big fry by repairing the pond once the flood waters recede. If necessary, we will contact the hatchery owners who produce fry.\" District Fisheries Officer Kalipada Roy said, \"By warning of floods in advance, we advised farmers to catch the mature fish and to erect nets around the ponds. We also told them to put enough food in sacks in the pond so that fish stay in the pond because of the food.\" According to previous data, the fish farmers here have never received government incentives, he added.

{"title": "Banks start releasing loans from incentives for marginalised entrepreneurs", "body": "SCHEME TO REVIVE RURAL ECONOMY Banks have slowly started disbursing loans to microfinance institutions from a Tk3,000 crore refinance scheme announced by the government nearly three months ago. The scheme is intended to support farmers and marginalised enterprises in rural areas hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Only half a dozen banks have approved disbursing Tk314 crore. Of this, Tk80 crore was disbursed by two banks to three microfinance institutions (MFIs) till July 12. Forty-two banks have entered into an agreement with the central bank to disburse the loans under the scheme announced on April 20, and set a self-target of disbursing Tk2,552 crore from the fund. Till now only a few banks have approved loans for the purpose. Pubali Bank disbursed Tk50 crore to Shakti Foundation this week to lend the money to marginalised individuals and enterprises. \"We have a plan to arrange one more loan scheme for farmers with another large MFI,\" Md Abdul Halim Chowdhury, managing director of the Pubali Bank, told The Business Standard. Another two MFIs – the Society for Social Service and Palli Mongal Kramosuchi – have drawn Tk30 crore from City Bank recently. The bank sanctioned Tk120 crore for the MFIs – Tk60 crore each – under this refinance scheme. \"The two MFIs can draw the rest of the funds any time,\" said Mashrur Arefin, managing director of City Bank. The loans under the scheme will be distributed through microcredit entities in order to ensure they reach the grassroots level. The Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) has cleared 117 MFIs as they are capable of lending under this stimulus fund. The new loan will offer a three-month grace period for microcredit non-governmental organisations (NGOs), according to the Bangladesh Bank guidelines. An official of the central bank said the loans will not be disbursed through banks or non-bank financial institutions directly as they mostly do not have the capacity to reach villagers. He also said the nine percent interest rate on the newly-announced loan is much lower than the rate charged by microcredit entities from their borrowers – microfinance firms usually charge up to 24 percent. As per the Bangladesh Bank guidelines, the new loan will be disbursed first to banks at a one percent lending rate. Banks will then lend it to microcredit organisations at a 3.5 percent rate. The NGOs will not be allowed to impose any other charges, except fees for admission, passbooks, loan forms and non-judicial purposes, from the borrowers, said the guidelines. Low-income people, farmers and marginalised or micro businesses will get loans for income-driven purposes. Md Serajul Islam, executive director and spokesperson of the Bangladesh Bank, said, \"We are seeking the MRA's help to analyse MFIs' ability to disburse and recover the loans under this package.\" \"Banks have been recommended to report the progress on a regular basis, so that the central bank can properly monitor the utilisation of the funds,\" he added. From NGOs, an individual can borrow a maximum of Tk75,000, while the borrowing limit for a group of five people has been set at Tk3 lakh. NGOs' lending limit to a single small entrepreneur has been set at Tk10 lakh, while the limit will be Tk30 lakh for a joint project by a group of at least five members. The borrowing limit will go up proportionately with the increase in the number of members in the group. Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, said, \"The package will be very helpful to revive the rural economy if it can be implemented properly.\" bank / loans / incentives / marginalised entrepreneurs", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/banking/banks-start-releasing-loans-incentives-marginalised-entrepreneurs-106315", "date": "2020-07-14T22:50:00+06:00", "author": "Shafayat Hossain 14 July, 2020, 10:50 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 10:55 pm", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 597, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:23:33.257446"}

According to the primary data obtained, the revenue board managed to collect Tk2,15,400 crore till June 30, down by Tk8,492 crore from the year-ago period and far from the revised target for the FY20. The NBR's collections stood at Tk2,23,892 crore in the FY19. Revenue collection also fell Tk85,100 crore short of the revised target set at Tk3,00,500 crore for FY20. The original NBR revenue collection target was Tk3,25,600 crore for the fiscal year. Revenue collection on an average grew by 13 to 14 per cent in the last one decade, with FY19 posting an 11 per cent growth. Officials said that overall revenue collection might slightly increase by the end of this month when final collection figures, particularly those of VAT, would arrive from the field-level offices. They said that the negative growth in revenue collection was not unexpected at all based on the ground reality as economic activities, including production, consumption, import and export had witnessed a standstill since the end of March following the general holiday and movement restriction enforced to check the spread of the coronavirus. Only income tax saw a marginal growth over the past year, while VAT experienced massive declines. According to the data, VAT collection stood at the highest Tk81,600 crore followed by income tax at Tk73,200 crore and customs duty Tk60,600 crore in FY20. In the previous FY19, VAT collection stood at Tk87,610 crore, income tax collection at Tk72,900 and customs duty Tk63,382 crore.

The taskforce should \"crack down on all kinds of infiltration, subversion, sabotage, violent terrorist activities, ethnic separatist activities, and extreme religious activities,\" according to the undated notes from a meeting of the taskforce published in the paper on Monday. The news of the taskforce came on the same day that a Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping was taken away by authorities. The main responsibility of the taskforce is to safeguard China's political system. \"Political security is related to national safety and people's well-being,\" according to the notes. Referencing the fight against coronavirus, the notes said a government can only guarantee its people's safety if it maintains a stable political environment. The taskforce is part of the \"Build a Peaceful China\" coordination group set up in April and led by Guo Shengkun, China's top law enforcement official. It's launch comes after China's parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong at the end of June which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

The US dispatched over 20,000 troops to the island in Operation Power Pack to support anti-Bosch forces. Subsequent elections in 1966, which were marred by allegations of fraud, brought a US-backed candidate to power. The US occupation led to increased repression in the Dominican Republic and sowed distrust towards Washington's interventionism in Latin America. Chile, 1973: Less than a decade later, another democratically elected president – Salvador Allende – was ousted in a US-backed coup in Chile that would become the most-cited example of Washington's disregard for democratic procedures in Latin America. Prior to the coup, the CIA had been conducting covert operations and spreading anti-Communist propaganda since the mid-1960s to prevent Allende from becoming president in the first place. After his election in 1970, Washington spent three years and another $8 million on covert activities, while expanding contacts with the Chilean military and the militant pro-coup opposition. The 1973 US-backed regime change led to a 17-year-long dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet. During that period, tens of thousands of people were imprisoned for political reasons, many of whom were subjected to torture.

This is the fourth consecutive year that the bank has obtained the highest credit rating from this internationally renowned rating agency. According to Moody's, the affirmation of the bank's rating reflects strong asset quality compared with those of its industry peers, robust profitability and capitalisation, driven by its competitive advantage in the higher-yielding small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment, and stable funding profile and liquidity. Moody's statement also mentions that the bank's credit strengths are built on stable funding and liquidity, supported by its good reputation and sizable distribution network as well as its strong capital base - highest among the Bangladeshi banks they rate. Commenting on the issue, Selim RF Hussain, managing director of Brac Bank said the bank stands on solid ground for its business model- driven by good governance, transparency, and value-based banking. Brac Bank is primarily funded by deposits, which constituted 81 percent of the bank's total liabilities as of 2019, Moody's also mentioned. \"Our customers have always shown their unwavering trust for us and we have always been active to ensure reciprocation of the trust in our strategies and performance matrices. We not only have a wide network and strong franchise but are backed by a diversified, dedicated, and talented set of human resources,\" Selim RF Hussain said.

The company's earnings per share increased to Tk0.52 in the period amid slower economic activities during the countrywide general holidays - April and May – put in force to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Sheikh Kabir Hossain, chairman of the company told The Business Standard, \"Our insurance association and the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority have taken a few initiatives to develop the sector. The initiatives include one promise of not taking over any business from another insurance company.\" \"All companies have maintained this policy. On top of that, we have been successful in stopping the unethical commission system. That's why our business has increased this year despite the coronavirus outbreak,\" he added. However, a senior official of the company said, \"We received a large amount from Sadharan Bima Corporation, thanks to a government insurance policy. Also, insurance claims decreased significantly due to the pandemic.\" The company has published its quarterly financial report on Tuesday evening. Its share price has increased by 24 percent to Tk37.20 over the last nine working days at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE).

The net asset value per share stood at Tk20.33 and the net operating cash flow per share was Tk0.74 during the first half of this year. Meanwhile, another general insurance company named United Insurance has published its half yearly financial statements. The company posted a 59 percent fall in its profits during the six-month period, while its profits declined 74 percent in the second quarter. Commenting on this, a market researcher said the securities regulator should conduct an inquiry on the half yearly financial statements of Sonar Bangla Insurance because these statements look confusing to investors. Meanwhile, Sonar Bangla Insurance recommended a 10 percent cash dividend to its shareholders for the financial year which ended on December 31, 2019. The dividend was recommended at a board meeting that was held on Tuesday evening. For final approval of the dividend, the company will arrange an annual general meeting on October 25 this year through a digital platform. The record date has been set on August 25. Last year, the company posted earnings per share of Tk1.99, which is 10 percent higher as compared to the previous year. In 2018, the company paid 6 percent cash and 6 percent stock dividends to its shareholders.

{"title": "Scarcity and survival: The growing cost of Bangladesh’s water crisis", "body": "Water is crucial not only for sustaining life but also for driving economic development — shaping agriculture, industry, public health, and social welfare. In Bangladesh, where high population density, climate vulnerability, and a predominantly agriculture-based economy intersect, the escalating water scarcity crisis is no longer a distant concern — it is an urgent and immediate threat. Data from 2024–2025 show that this problem is already jeopardising livelihoods, raising economic costs, and undermining national development goals. Water scarcity in Bangladesh is now affecting millions in both rural and urban areas. Although notable progress has been made — such as the expansion of irrigation systems and the promotion of surface water use — the severity of the crisis continues to intensify. Without immediate and scaled-up action, Bangladesh risks failing to meet key Sustainable Development Goals (particularly SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation), with serious long-term consequences for public health, food security, and economic stability. The government has introduced a range of strategic policies aimed at ensuring sustainable water management. The National Water Policy (1999), the National Water Management Plan (2001), and the long-term Delta Plan 2100 provide frameworks for water allocation and conservation. More recently, the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2023–2050 has identified water resources as central to climate resilience, setting out measures to improve irrigation efficiency, expand surface water use, and strengthen governance. Projects such as the Blue Gold Project, co-financed by the Netherlands, promote integrated water management in coastal regions to enhance agricultural productivity. Yet despite such initiatives, major challenges remain. Many policies are outdated or poorly enforced, government coordination is fragmented, and water-use data is frequently incomplete and obsolete. Financial and technical constraints also limit the adoption of water-saving technologies such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD), drip irrigation, and rainwater harvesting. Dhaka, the capital with a population exceeding 20 million, is facing a severe groundwater crisis. Experts report an annual decline of 1 to 1.5 metres, with some areas seeing falls of 2 to 3 metres each year. Hand-pump wells, once effective at depths of 200 feet, are now running dry, forcing residents to invest in deep pumps or depend on wealthier neighbours. Although Dhaka WASA claims that 70% of the city's water supply comes from groundwater, critics argue that the heavy reliance on deep tube wells is worsening the crisis. If this trend continues, Dhaka's aquifers could face irreversible damage by the middle of the century. In the southwestern coastal region, the situation is equally alarming. Residents of upazilas such as Koyra, Paikgachha, Dacope, Asashuni, and Shyamnagar are experiencing acute shortages of drinking water due to saltwater intrusion. Ponds and tube wells now show salinity levels exceeding 1,000 mg/L — far above the safe drinking standard. A UNDP survey in 2024 found that 73% of households in these areas are consuming unsafe water, resulting in rising cases of hypertension, waterborne disease, and maternal health complications. Despite government spending of more than Tk525 crore across eight projects — including rainwater harvesting systems, reverse osmosis plants, and deep tube wells — most initiatives have failed to provide lasting solutions. Poor maintenance, limited community participation, and weak long-term planning mean many people still have to walk long distances for safe water or rely on unsafe alternatives. Water scarcity threatens the very foundations of Bangladesh's economy: agriculture and industry. The Boro rice season is especially water-intensive, with over 70% of irrigation dependent on groundwater, particularly in northwestern districts such as Rajshahi and Naogaon. Salinity, silted canals, and declining water tables have already reduced crop yields and pushed up production costs. Industries — particularly textiles, the country's leading export sector — also depend heavily on water for dyeing, washing, and cooling. Shortages and deteriorating water quality are beginning to disrupt industrial operations, especially in Savar and Gazipur, where surface water is polluted by untreated waste and heavy metals. Meanwhile, urban utilities face rising costs to purify contaminated water, costs that are ultimately borne by consumers. Bangladesh can confront its water crisis through a holistic strategy that combines technology, policy, infrastructure, and community engagement. Promoting efficient irrigation methods such as AWD could cut agricultural water use by up to 30% without lowering yields, while investment in canals, dams, and reservoirs would reduce pressure on groundwater in vulnerable regions. Stronger regulation of extraction through monitoring, smart metering, and zoning is vital to protect urban aquifers, particularly in Dhaka. Expanding WASH sector funding would help secure safe water and sanitation for all, while better water quality monitoring — through modern laboratories, mobile units, and tighter pollution control — could safeguard resources against arsenic, pathogens, and industrial waste. Crucially, effective governance across ministries, along with active involvement from local communities, is essential for sustainable and inclusive water management. The evidence from 2024–2025 makes clear that there is no room for complacency. From the sinking aquifers of Dhaka to the salinity-stricken villages of the southwest, water scarcity is already damaging health, livelihoods, and future resilience. If bold and coordinated measures are not implemented now, the crisis will deepen — threatening development progress, food and water security, and economic growth. Yet Bangladesh still has an opportunity to turn this challenge into a catalyst for change. By embracing smarter water governance, prioritising targeted investment, and ensuring inclusive community participation, the country can build a safer, more sustainable, and more equitable water future.

{"title": "Cricket's new normal faces acid test after shutdown", "body": "International cricket will gingerly ease out of a 117-day shutdown in Southampton next week but the scars of the Covid-19 pandemic will be clearly evident at the Ageas Bowl. An encounter between the fourth and eighth-ranked teams in test cricket is hardly a pinnacle but England's series against West Indies could offer a glimpse into a future where the game plods on under the shadow of the new coronavirus. \"Fans are tired of Zoom interviews, old matches and highlights. Finally, there's something to look forward to and it's very important that we get it right,\" cricket historian Boria Majumdar told Reuters. \"This is the beginning of cricket's new normal.\" The last time the sweet sound of bat meeting ball was heard in international cricket was when Australia beat New Zealand in a one-dayer in front of empty stands in Sydney on March 13. While players have done their best to keep their skills sharp at home, the shutdown has wrought financial devastation on the game. Australia's affluent board slashed jobs and state grants, and its chief executive Kevin Roberts was forced to resign following criticism of his handling of the crisis. For smaller boards, the impact has been even more acute. West Indies have halved the salaries of players and coaching staff, Afghanistan slashed coaches' pay and its contracted players could be the next, while Ireland's board is one of several staring at depleted cash reserves. The Twenty20 World Cup, scheduled for October and November in Australia, looks unlikely to go ahead and the International Cricket Council (ICC) will announce the tournament's fate this month. India's wealthy board (BCCI) had to postpone the Indian Premier League due to the pandemic and is staring at a potential $534 million loss of revenue if it cannot find a new window for its Twenty20 cash cow. The BCCI hopes it can be slotted into the Twenty20 World Cup's window if that is postponed but has been kept waiting with the ICC still to make a decision. The inaugural World Test Championship has also become untenable following a series of postponements, including eight matches involving Bangladesh. \"Unless the current ICC Test Championship cycle is extended there is no way we can play those eight test matches in the stipulated time frame,\" Bangladesh Cricket Board official Akram Khan told Cricbuzz. Sports business expert Thomas Abraham says he would not be surprised if the top teams play among themselves more to shore up finances. \"They were being shortsighted even before Covid-19 threw a spanner in the collective works,\" he told Reuters. \"It's all transactional and zero about the future of the game.\" While Cricket has plotted a way to restart, the playing environment will not be the same, not least because of the absence of spectators. Players will have to clear multiple Covid-19 tests before being herded into bio-secure bubbles and remaining there until the series is over. Bowlers will not be able to apply saliva to the ball anymore, even if it compromises its swing, and substitutes will be allowed in test cricket for any player that contracts the virus. Even the uniforms will be different after the ICC agreed to allow an additional logo on team shirts and sweaters to help the boards recoup some of their losses. Still, restless players and action-starved fans will be happy that there will be any cricket at all. Novak Djokovic's ill-fated Adria Tour tennis event, which resulted in the world number one and a string of other players testing positive for the virus, was a stark warning to sports not to try and move too quickly, Majumdar said. \"There's a right way, and there's a wrong way,\" he said. \"Novak Djokovic was the wrong way. We really need to get it right. \"This is a massive acid test for the game.\" England Cricket Team / West Indies Cricket Team", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/crickets-new-normal-faces-acid-test-after-shutdown-101440", "date": "2020-07-03T17:40:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 03 July, 2020, 05:40 pm Last modified: 03 July, 2020, 05:57 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 642, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:23:54.762155"}
{"title": "DGHS inked MoU with Regent Hospital on instructions of health ministry", "body": "The health directorate in an explanation has said it had allowed Regent Hospital to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients at the direction of the higher authorities of the health ministry. In March, when coronavirus patients were not being admitted to any hospital, Regent Hospital expressed its interest in signing a contract to serve as a Covid dedicated facility. \"At the direction of the higher authorities of the health ministry, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) entered into an agreement with Regent Hospital,\" the health directorate said in a press release on Saturday. The press release signed by Dr Mohammad Jahangir Kabir, assistant director of the health directorate, explaining the DGHS's position on the fraud of the Regent Hospital and JKG Group, said that news of the fraud by Regent Hospital owner Shahed Karim had come out, but the health directorate was not aware of it earlier. \"However, under the direction of the ministry, an initiative was taken to sign a memorandum of understanding on the admission of patients, but before that, during inspections in the two clinics, they found the medical environment suitable, but their licence was not renewed,\" it read. A memorandum of understanding was signed with Regent on March 21 on the condition of renewal of the licence. Prior to this agreement, DGHS Director General Professor Dr Abul Kalam Azad did not know the Regent Hospital chairman, let alone his identity, it added. However, after the agreement, Shahed Karim came to the directorate several times, when he had tried to say he had contacts with many eminent persons and that relatives of those people were admitted in his hospital for Covid-19 treatment. The DGHS press release also said the directorate had received complaints about the Regent Hospital from intelligence and other sources, and on the basis of which the RAB on July 6 conducted an operation in the presence of a representative of the health directorate. The health directorate had been deceived while clearing the directorate's position on a memorandum of understanding with Regent Hospital and trying to do a good job, the press release said. As a result, the hospital was closed on July 7. In the same notification, the DGHS also informed about the fraudulence of another organisation called Jobeda Khatun Shastha Seba (JKG) Health Care. The chief coordinator of the organisation Ariful Chowdhury is the owner of an event management group named Oval Group Limited. Oval Group was given the responsibility of the event management of Health Services Week 2018 organised by the Ministry of Health. After the start of the Covid-19 crisis, Ariful Chowdhury came to the directorate and said JKGL wanted to set up some booths in Bangladesh on the model of South Korea. The health directorate thought that the group can be allowed because they already had work experience with the Oval Group. But the DGHS later cancelled their contract with the JKG Group after allegations of fraud were found. The health directorate said in a statement that lately, some vested quarters are trying to tarnish the reputation of the directorate by confusing the media with trembling and false information. The position of the organisation is clear if any officer or employee takes refuge in dishonesty or injustice. If the crime is proved, everyone expects the responsible persons to be punished according to the law. However, in many cases the general and systematic limitations of the organisation are not taken into account. Instead of sympathy, oblique remarks and fragmented and distorted information are being presented. Attempts are being made to assassinate personal characters by spreading indecently false information. \"We think that there is be no personal motive behind all this. The situation is such that honest officers are no longer comfortable in explaining the situation to the media, leading to more confusion. If anyone commits a crime, it will be come out in the investigation and also punished,\" the press release added.

Whether your house is imposing in appearance or a typical looking flat, the first thing visitors will notice is what they see when they step into the entrance. The sight of the entryway that welcomes you home every day can be treated by designers as a soft transition from outside to indoor, by adding plants or decorating the entrance with an artwork or sculpture. Manager's room, driver's waiting zone are new space requirements on the ground floor for apartment buildings nowadays. Architects are working accordingly. A tiny suffocated space with the minimum opening for guards is an age-old practice. Guard's waiting space may be merged with the entrance hall, ensuring a humane attitude towards them. Electrical wires, internet connection, telecommunication services are some inescapable services that need room on the ground floor. Hundreds of wires hanging together can be visually disconcerting. It demands designers' attention and should be placed in an orderly manner with non-transparent opaque separators - a common practice in modern apartment buildings. Sanitary pipelines and hanging wires from the ceiling can be hidden from the public's eye by installing nonstructural screen walls.

{"title": "‘Income inequality is now a crisis’", "body": "The plunder of banks has become a shortcut to becoming millionaires in Bangladesh. Every year, businessmen and industrialists conspire to loot several billions of taka in the form of bank loans. Nowadays, not paying back loans has become a culture. A lion’s share of the plundered money is laundered abroad. The observation was made by noted economist Dr Moinul Islam while presenting a paper titled “Ever-increasing income inequality in Bangladesh: What is the solution?”. He was addressing a seminar on income and wealth inequality in Bangladesh, organised by Bangladesh Economic Association (BEA) on Saturday. Eminent economist and former governor of Bangladesh Bank (BB) Dr Mohammed Farashuddin was present there as chief guest while BEA President Dr Abul Barkat presided over the programme. Adopting illegal means, the number of rich people has kept rising rapidly. Be it civil and military bureaucrats or businesspeople, everyone is getting involved in corruption to become rich quickly. In the one hand the number of rich people is increasing and on the other hand, income inequality is widening, due to economic growth without employment. Bangladesh has now reached close to a dangerous level of income inequality. It has now become a crisis for the country. The noted economist said there was corruption during the tenure of Bangabandhu also, but it did not become systematic then. After coming to power, Zia created an opportunity for all to get involved in corruption. As the USA did not support Bangabandhu’s government, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other donor agencies did not assist Bangladesh. After Zia had taken over power, the donor agencies gave big amounts of financial aid. A major portion of that was plundered. Since then, corruption started in Bangladesh. He said the unscrupulous way to become a millionaire quickly in Bangladesh is to engage in corruption. No government or autonomous organisation in Bangladesh is above corruption. Members of the law enforcing agencies, revenue officials, government, semi-government, autonomous organisations, the judiciary, courts, education department, the educational institutions, health department and government hospitals are involved in corruption. A big portion of this money is being siphoned off abroad. Now some 62 percent of parliament members are businessmen. The key-note paper stated that four to five crore people in villages have now reached the threshold of lower-middle income and middle-income group, thanks to remittance inflow from expatriate workers. However, the main beneficiary of the rise in immigration has been the several thousand manpower businesses. Most of them are becoming millionaires quickly. Prof Moinul Islam said governments have been keeping crony capitalism in operation for 44 years, in line with the open market economy. These governments did not have any urge to reduce income inequality. He said Bangladesh now stands second in export of readymade garments in the world. But it cannot be said that workers in this sector are economically empowered. But they are contributing successfully to the RMG industry. The number of millionaires are rising in the country, because of the hard labour of RMG workers. The RMG industry owners are laundering the highest amount of money abroad. The former professor of Chittagong University said, among the millionaires who have a second home in Malaysia and house in “Begum Para” in Canada, the families of RMG factory owners are on top, alongside corrupt engineers, civil surgeons, bureaucrats, military officers and politicians. The paper also said that among the non-resident Bangladeshi families who have escaped abroad, the number of businessmen and industrialists are high. The number of rich people in trade and service sector has been increasing rapidly. Real estate, construction, Media, private universities and medical colleges, private banks, insurance, private English medium schools, colleges and kindergartens, newspapers, NGOs, hotels, luxury transport service, hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres are high profit-making businesses. According to Bangladesh Bank statistics in 2012, the number of millionaires were 23,212. In 2014, the number crossed 50,000. In July 2015, the number soared to 54,727. In 2016, the finance minister announced that the number of people having bank accounts with deposits of more than Tk1 crore each is over 114,000. That economic benefit is going to a small section of society is a dangerous signal. The gini coefficient is a way to measure inequality. In 1973, the gini coefficient was only 0.36 percent. Although the country was poor, inequality was comparatively tolerable. As per Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 by Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), inequality increased to 0.483. According to international norms, if the country’s gini coefficient reaches 0.5 percent, income inequality in Bangladesh will have reached a dangerous level. He said at the primary level of the country’s education, there are 11 types of education systems. Children are attending different types of educational institutions based on the income of their parents. It reflects the disparity in the industrial sector. Four types of secondary and higher secondary educational institutions exist in the country. The population of Dhaka city has reached 1.75 crore. Some 40 percent, or 70 lakh, are slum dwellers. Dr Farashuddin said the number of loan defaulters has been increasing as politicians have been patronising them. He narrated a story of how in 1992, a bank decided not to give any loan to Fazlul Haque, a loan defaulter from Narayanganj. His loan application then went to the parliamentary standing committee. The committee comprised of six lawmakers from Awami League and five from BNP. All of them opined in favour of giving fresh loans to Fazlul Haque. On inequality, the former Bangladesh Bank governor said the per capita income does not reflect the real economic situation of a person. He said inequality exists not only in wealth and education. If disparity in health cannot be removed, development is not possible. Wealth inequality has to be eliminated. Dr Shafique uz Zaman, chairman of Dhaka University’s Economics Department, said there is a regional disparity, alongside national inequality. Emphasis has to be given on employment generation and industrialisation for removing inequality. Dr KAS Murshid, director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) said the issue of inequality used to be discussed earlier, but now it is not. Income inequality has reached a crisis level, but ordinary people do not react to it. Dr Abul Barkat said the government only listens to talk about development. No political personality is available to listen to issues of inequality. On solving the problem of inequality, Dr Moinul Islam said it is difficult to solve the ever-increasing income inequality, but it is not impossible. The goodwill of the top leadership of the state is the foremost requirement because re-distribution of income and wealth is not possible without a change in the political policy. China, Vietnam, Cuba, Israel and Sri Lanka have been able to slow down or stop the rise of inequality by adopting various income redistribution programmes and implementing them successfully. However, in the contemporary world, no developing country except Cuba has achieved much success in reducing the gini coefficient. Dr Moinul Islam said there is nothing to boast of in the 8.13 percent growth. The well-being of people can be understood by using social indicators – health, education and gender inequality – as devised by Amartya Sen. income equality / economist Dr Moinul Islam", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/income-inequality-now-crisis", "date": "2019-09-07T22:10:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 07 September, 2019, 10:10 pm Last modified: 07 September, 2019, 10:36 pm", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 1200, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:01.488446"}
{"title": "UK’s Starmer tells Xi he wants ‘sophisticated’ ties with China", "body": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he wants to build a \"sophisticated relationship\" with Beijing to boost economic growth and security today (29 January), signalling a reset after years of strained ties between the two countries. On the most important day of his four-day visit to China—the first by a British prime minister in eight years—Starmer held an 80-minute summit with Xi at the Great Hall of the People, followed by a lunch. He is also scheduled to meet Premier Li Qiang later in the day. Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver on its growth promises, has prioritised improving relations with the world's second-largest economy, despite lingering concerns over espionage and human rights. \"China is a vital player on the global stage, and it's vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but also allow for meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree,\" Starmer told Xi at the start of their meeting. Xi said ties between China and Britain had gone through \"twists and turns\" that had not served the interests of either country, adding that China was ready to develop a long-term strategic partnership. \"We can deliver a result that can withstand the test of history,\" Xi said, flanked by senior ministers. Starmer is the latest Western leader to step up diplomatic engagement with China, as countries hedge against uncertainty stemming from the United States under President Donald Trump. Trump's intermittent threats of trade tariffs and his pledge to seize control of Greenland—an autonomous territory of Denmark—have unsettled long-standing US allies, including Britain. Starmer's visit follows closely after that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic agreement with Beijing to remove trade barriers, a move that drew criticism from Trump. Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King's College London, said he expected several Britain-China deals to be announced to demonstrate improved ties. Starmer is accompanied by more than 50 business leaders, underlining his focus on securing economic gains. Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after relations deteriorated under previous Conservative governments, which curtailed Chinese investment over national security concerns and raised alarms about the erosion of political freedoms in Hong Kong. \"I made the promise 18 months ago, when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outwards again,\" Starmer told Xi. \"Because, as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back home—from prices on supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.\" Britain's opposition Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said on Wednesday that she would not have visited China due to the security risks the country poses. British security services have repeatedly accused China of spying on the government—claims Beijing has denied. In a sign of cooperation, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce a joint initiative to tackle criminal gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants. The agreement will focus on curbing the use of Chinese-made engines in small boats used to transport migrants across Europe. British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers' supply routes and work with manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street said. Starmer told reporters en route to China that he would \"raise the issues that need to be raised\" on human rights, including the case of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen convicted in December on national security charges. After arriving in Beijing late Wednesday, Starmer dined at a restaurant known for its mushroom-based dishes, which also hosted former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during her 2023 visit. A video posted on China's Weibo platform showed Starmer practising the Chinese phrase for thank you—\"xie xie\"—with restaurant staff as he posed for photographs.

{"title": "Audi presents Q4 Sportback e-tron concept", "body": "German automaker - Audi, first exhibited the Q4 e-tron concept at the Geneva Motor Show 2019. It was the first electric SUV to have been manufactured by Audi. The Q4 Sportback e-tron is the second model among Audi's line of e-SUV which will go into production next year. The Q4 Sportback is powered by two electric motors which deliver an output of 225kW. It comes with quattro all-wheel drive transmission system. This concept SUV can go from 0-100 kmph in 6.3 seconds and the top speed has been restricted to 180 kmph. This electric SUV is equipped with a large battery that holds the capacity of 82kWh and takes up the entire space between the axles. Audi claims that the Q4 Sportback can deliver a range of over 450 kilometers and in case of variants with rear-wheel drive, the range will extend to 500 kilometers. The silhouette of the Sportback slopes downward to the back in a subtle and dynamic curve. The roof line transitions into the significantly inclined D-pillars and ends in a horizontal spoiler at the level of the lower window edge. As a result, the future Audi Q4 Sportback appears much longer than its sister model, the Q4 e-tron concept. On the rear end, the taillights are connected with each other via a light band. Both versions of the Q4 share the same design of the bumper diffuser unit with its horizontal slats and the illuminated e-tron logo in the middle. The fenders of this concept follow the same design that Audi adapted to back in the 1980s. This concept's interior gets a two-tone combination, light colours on the upper cabin and dark carpet on the floor. The headlining, window pillars, upper section of the door rail, and dash panel are fitted with white and beige microfiber textiles. The floor covering is made of recycled materials. Instead of chrome-plated metal decor frames, the surfaces are covered with a high-quality multi-layer paint finish. The seats have integrated head restraints and are upholstered with Alcantara material. The cockpit comes with a new feature - large-format head-up display with an augmented reality function. It can display important graphical information, such as directional arrows for turning, directly on the course of the road. To fulfil infotainment needs, this concept SUV is equipped with a 12.3-inch touchscreen. The Audi Q4 Sportback e-tron concept is painted in kinetic grey, a light metallic and pearl effect colour that takes on a distinct greenish tinge depending on the angle of the light. In contrast, the lower sections of the body are painted in a dark grey colour.

{"title": "Always believed Dhoni should bat up because he’s so destructive: Ganguly", "body": "Sourav Ganguly is the man responsible for giving Indian cricket MS Dhoni. When selectors were in a fix regarding which wicketkeeper to pick for India's ODI series against Bangladesh in 2004, it was Ganguly's word that ultimately got Dhoni in the Indian team. It was under Ganguly that Dhoni got his first break – a batting promotion – and he ensured the opportunity was not wasted by smashing a prolific 148 against Pakistan in just his fifth innings. 15 years later, Ganguly is well retired and serving as the president of the BCCI, while Dhoni's future remains uncertain. On Dhoni's 39th birthday, Ganguly spoke about India's most successful captain, saying he was glad he could help give India the cricketing icon that is Dhoni. \"That's my job, isn't it? That's every captain's job to pick and make the best team possible,\" Ganguly told Mayank Agarwal on the episode of 'Open Nets with Mayank'. \"You go by your instincts; you go by the faith on that player that he will deliver for you and I'm happy that Indian cricket got a Mahendra Singh Dhoni because he's unbelievable. One of the great players in world cricket I would say, not just a finisher.\" While Dhoni has made a career out of finishing matches for India, Ganguly felt he was always better off batting higher for India. Dhoni has batted 16 times at No. 3 and averaged 82.75 with 993 runs at the position. At No. 4, Dhoni has played 30 innings, averaging 56.58 and scoring 1358 runs. At No. 5, Dhoni averages 50.30 having tallied 3169 runs, while at No. 6, Dhoni has batted the most and scored 4164 runs from 129 innings. \"I think everyone talks about the way he finishes lower down the order. He batted at No. 3 when I was the captain; he got a 148 against Pakistan in Vizag. I always believe that he should bat up the order because he is so destructive,\" Ganguly said. \"The best players in the shorter format have the ability to hit boundaries at will.

{"title": "Amit Hassan: The challenges of being a football agent here", "body": "Football is the world's biggest sport in terms of following and money. In the modern world of football, players and managers are not the only important people anymore. Sometimes, agents are much more important as shown by the revolution brought on by Jorge Mendes at Wolves. Agents are tasked with all of their client's off-field activities like, negotiating contracts, endorsements, handling a social image etc. While the importance of football agents in modern times is immense, Bangladesh hasn't yet properly caught up to the world in this regard. Footballers and clubs in Bangladesh still opt to directly work with each other instead of employing proper agents which has led to the creation of many wage related scandals and problems. Amit Hassan, the director of Leo Entertainment and Sports Management, is one of the leading football agents in Bangladesh. In this special interview with The Business Standard, he talks about the struggles and problems a football agent has to face while working in Bangladesh. TBS: How have you been coping with the Covid-19 pandemic in your personal and in your businesses? Amit : Me and my family have been so far staying healthy in the pandemic but it has had a very big negative impact on my businesses. All of my businesses are entertainment related, from sports (Leo Entertainment and Sports Management) to food (Madchef and Cheez). The pandemic has had a very negative financial impact on the entertainment industry and my case is not different. TBS : Why did you not purse on to become a professional footballer or a manager? Amit: I was a very good player in my younger years and even tried out for Abahani. But in Bangladesh, parents hesitate to let their children pursue football as a career as it doesn't guarantee a good return. That's why after playing a few professional games at 19, I gave up on being a football player. TBS: How did you get into being a sports agent and how successful has your agency, Leo Entertainment been? Amit: I joined a sports agency in the later part of 2014 but they mostly focused on cricket. So I decided to go about my own direction and after a few years I left and joined Leo Entertainment as a director. We've cracked a lot of deals with Bashundhara Kings and last year we were able to arrange an event with YKK Japan where the coach of Real Madrid Foundation came to Bangladesh to coach underprivileged children. This has been a very big achievement for my company. TBS: What are some restrictions that you had to face while working as a football agent? Amit: First of all, Bangladeshi footballers still don't know how agents work. There are lots of superstitions out there that agents will run away with their money. Clubs also avoid working with agents as working with a player directly is a cheaper option. Sometimes when I bring a foreign player, clubs try to contact him directly and set his wages. As a result the agent misses out on his commission. The recent deal that Jamal Bhuiyan did with Apex was done by me. Most players and companies do not understand how much agents can help them out in terms of advertising. Agents can also help players become commercially more viable off the field as well through social media. But most of them are yet to realise this fact. All I can say is that I'm trying to change this and make the football scene of Bangladesh more commercially viable and more attractive. TBS :What players do you have on your books and how is it like working with them? Amit : We work with players like Zidan Miah, Sanjay Karim and Joseph Rahman. The local players are not that sellable that's why we try to work with foreign players who can represent Bangladesh. TBS:Why do think Agents are important in Bangladeshi football? Amit: We can make the football in Bangladesh better by making the league more commercially viable and increasing viewership. If we can arrange deals for better foreign players than our players will improve. Thus, the standard of Bangladeshi football will improve. The ISL have been successful in this regard and they have done it through their agent culture. TBS: Whats your biggest aspiration? Amit: I want to pursue two things. I want my company to grow and I want to get all of the coaching badges. I aim to get a job in the US before the 2026 world cup. I want to become experienced overseas and then come back to Bangladesh if they offer me something nice. bangladesh football", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/amit-hassan-challenges-being-football-agent-here-104722", "date": "2020-07-11T12:30:00+06:00", "author": "Nusayer Andalib 11 July, 2020, 12:30 pm Last modified: 11 July, 2020, 12:42 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 771, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:12.595516"}

Hundreds of supporters followed the bus on motorcycles, waving placards reading \"Pride of Victory,\" \"City of Heroes,\" and \"Victory Has Come, the Cup Has Been Lifted.\" The slogan \"The Cup Has Come Home\" was emblazoned across the front of the bus. The parade moved from the airport along the Rajshahi-Naogaon highway, passing Amchattar, Biman Chattar, the RUET Flyover, and Paris Road at Rajshahi University. At the university, students welcomed the champions by showering them with flowers. In scenes of celebration, many fans removed their shirts, T-shirts, and sweaters and tossed them toward the players, who signed the garments and returned them. At several points, Shanto and Mushfiq lifted the BPL trophy high as fans cheered to the beat of music. The two stars were also seen dancing atop the bus alongside the crowd. After leaving the university area, the bus passed through Talaimari and Saheb Bazar, stopping briefly in front of Rajshahi Collegiate School and Rajshahi College, where students again gathered to greet the players. The procession later toured Lakhsmipur, Darikhardbona, Railgate, and Amchattar areas in the city, before concluding at Nabil Industrial Park in Paba. Throughout the journey, people lined the roads, waving and taking selfies from afar as the city celebrated its champion team.

{"title": "Amid high inflation, living with illness means carrying a double burden", "body": "On some days, Dolon simply stops taking her medicine. Not because her condition has improved or doctors advised her to. She stops because she is exhausted mentally, financially and emotionally. Almost all her salary now disappears into medication and treatment. Every few months, prices rise again — quietly but relentlessly — outpacing her income and shrinking her choices. \"This is one of the reasons I don't even think about getting married,\" she said. \"When I think about children, I feel scared. I can barely manage my own life.\" However, for Saiful Islam, a thyroid cancer patient, daily medication is non-negotiable. Missing a single day once landed him in emergency care, with doctors fearing a relapse. But inflation has meant that life is shrinking inch by inch. \"I must undergo Tg, anti-Tg, serum calcium, scans, FT3 and FT4 tests every three months. Once the reports stabilised after a year, the tests became mandatory every six months. I must take three Thyronorm 50 tablets daily. Missing even one day causes complications. When I first started the medication, one strip cost Tk120. Then it became Tk180, and now it is Tk240. I have no choice but to take it,\" Saiful said. \"Earlier, I used to buy shirts worth Tk1,000; now I buy ones priced at Tk600. Where I once ate two kilograms of fish per week, I now eat one. This is how I am adjusting. There is no alternative,\" he added. Since inflation accelerated after 2022, illness has become not just a health crisis in Bangladesh but a financial one. Families are cutting back on food, clothing, travel — even dignity — selling homes, skipping doses, and delaying treatment just to survive rising medical costs amid a broader cost-of-living squeeze. Skipping doses, selling homes, taking loans Bangladesh today bears one of the heaviest private healthcare burdens in the world. According to official data from the National Health Accounts, 68.5% of medical expenses were paid out of pocket in 2020, rising to around 73% in 2021. Only war-torn Afghanistan fares worse. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum of 20%. Behind these numbers are people like Dolon and Saiful, recalibrating their lives around pills, test reports, and medical bills. In Rajshahi, Nadim Abdullah runs a small shop that supports his father, younger sister, wife, and himself. When someone in the family falls sick, the business grinds to a halt. \"Sometimes we are supposed to take seven days' medicine, but we stretch it over three days,\" he said. \"If I take medicine properly, the shop's cash will be gone.\" Loans followed. NGO installments piled up. Eventually, Nadim sold his house. \"My wife has been suffering from gynaecological problems for four years,\" Nadim explained. \"I can't afford proper treatment. I bring home homeopathic medicine just to give her some comfort. It doesn't work. This July, I sold my house. Over more than a decade, my inability to sustain and manage my business led me to accumulate debts of Tk5–7 lakh. I sold my house to repay them.\" According to a 2022 survey by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), approximately 18% of the households face catastrophic health expenditures and more than 6.13 million people were pushed below the poverty line due to healthcare costs. Households cope by borrowing, selling assets, or simply avoiding treatment altogether. My wife has been suffering from gynaecological complications for four years. I can't afford proper treatment. I bring home homeopathic medicine just to give her some comfort. It doesn't work. This July, I sold my house. Nadim Abdullah, shopowner, Rajshahi Rumana Huque, professor of Economics at the University of Dhaka and a public health specialist, believes that the crisis cannot be separated from the post-pandemic economy. \"Since Covid-19, people have been under immense pressure,\" she said. \"Add to this the Ukraine–Russia war, the overall economic slowdown, and Bangladesh's political situation. \"What we see in labour force surveys is rising unemployment, especially among women. In this context, the macroeconomic situation is directly affecting people's ability to pay for healthcare from their own income,\" Rumana added. Women's unemployment has risen the fastest, even as healthcare costs climb. For many families, women quietly absorb the shock — cutting their own needs first. Medicines: The biggest drain The largest share of out-of-pocket spending in Bangladesh goes to medicines. According to BIDS, 54.4% of the cost was spent on purchasing medicines, while the diagnostic cost is 27.52%, 10.31% for consultation and 7.77% for transport cost. Rumana Huque said Bangladesh's medicine prices are unusually high compared to neighbouring countries. \"If we compare with India, Nepal or Pakistan, medicine prices in Bangladesh are relatively higher. This is often disputed by pharmacists, but comparative data shows clearly that prices here are significantly higher.\" The absence of a structured referral system worsens the problem. Patients can buy many drugs over the counter without prescriptions. Self-medication rises. Costs spiral. \"People end up buying medicines on their own,\" Rumana explained. \"That increases out-of-pocket expenditure even further.\" In theory, essential medicines are free at public facilities. In reality, supplies dry up fast. \"In many upazila health complexes, medicines run out within 15 to 20 days. After that, patients must buy from their own pocket.\" Shoayeb Mahmud from Manikganj knows this well. His mother's diabetes medication costs Tk3,600–4,000 a month. His father's medicines cost another Tk1,600. Their child's skin infection has already drained Tk20,000. \"We borrow from relatives for treatment,\" he said. \"Still, we can't recover.\" Doctors often prescribe medicines outside the Essential Drug List, even at public hospitals. Those drugs must be purchased privately, at market prices. \"This creates additional pressure,\" Rumana Huque mentioned. \"Even when people go to government facilities, they still end up paying.\" Urban patients face a different trap. Public hospitals are overcrowded and under-resourced, forcing people into private clinics. \"There is no prepayment mechanism, no insurance,\" Dr Huque said. \"In urban areas, people depend heavily on private providers. That pushes costs much higher.\" Even within cities, prices vary wildly between clinics. Medicines are often sold under brand names rather than generics, creating confusion and inequality. \"There is disparity between urban and rural areas,\" she said. \"But also disparity within cities themselves.\" A system stretched thin According to the World Bank, financial hardship drops sharply when out-of-pocket spending falls below 20%. Bangladesh is nowhere near that threshold. The root problem lies in chronic underinvestment. Bangladesh allocates around 1% of GDP to health, far below the WHO-recommended 5%. While health budgets have grown nominally, much of the money goes to salaries and routine expenses. A significant portion remains unspent due to weak implementation. The result is a system where people with means seek treatment abroad — in India, Thailand, or Malaysia — draining foreign currency, while those without means delay care or fall into poverty. Professor Rumana argued that the pharmaceutical industry and government both have roles to play. \"The pharmaceutical industry has an important role to play. If companies were willing to reduce their profit margins, prices could come down. Many raw materials and components for medicines are imported, and reducing import taxes on these inputs could also help lower costs. At present, the cost of doing business in Bangladesh — across industries, including pharmaceuticals — is very high,\" she said. \"If the government were to provide targeted incentives to pharmaceutical manufacturers — such as tax relief, support through export processing zones, or other facilities — particularly for life-saving medicines, prices could be brought down to a more affordable level. This would significantly reduce the financial burden on the public.\" Until then, households will continue to absorb the shock.

{"title": "‘Data revolution’ can curb health emergency: Speakers", "body": "Evidence-based data is a critical enabler not only for responding to the health emergency posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, but also for ensuring access to routine health services and social protection for the poorest and most vulnerable, and supporting jobs for the locals and the returnees. The panelists stressed the vital importance of \"Data revolution\" for Covid-19 response and recovery at a virtual event on Monday, said a press release. The event titled \"Accelerating Post Covid Recovery Using Data Revolution\" was co-sponsored by the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh to the UN in New York, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and A2i programme of government of Bangladesh, government of Somalia, UN agencies, and Future of Work Lab Bangladesh. Rabab Fatima, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations chaired the event on the margins of the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF). In her opening and welcome remarks, Rabab Fatima said, \"As we are fighting the pandemic, the importance of scientific evidence has become more significant than ever, so has been the collection and analysis of data - not only for being informed of what's happening, but very importantly to suggest evidence-based response and timely actions for recovery\". Speaking at the event, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen highlighted the multidimensional challenges emanating from the Covid-19 crisis across the world. Referring to the specific challenges faced by Bangladesh, he observed, \"Like many migrant sending countries, Bangladesh is now facing the challenge of returning migrants as the economy is badly hit in many host countries. The health pandemic coupled with the dwindling oil prices have rendered many people jobless. By collecting, processing, and using this data of these returnees, we can appropriately reskill them, and also can help reintegrate them in a sustainable manner\". Anir Chowdhury, Policy Advisor of Aspire to Innovate (a2i) delivered the keynote speech at the event. He shared some good practices in utilising data for tackling the Covid-19 in Bangladesh, namely, identification of possible hot zones of Covid-19 infections, provision of tele-health services, creation of a database of more than 5 million people who are in need for cash transfer, designing post-Covid skills and employment response, and whole of government data integration for effective policy response. Among other speakers, Dr Denis Nkala, Regional Coordinator (Asia and Pacific), UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) shared how his office was playing the important role in supporting the efforts of the developing south in the response and recovery phase of the crisis. A rich panel discussion took place immediately after the keynote. The panel included, among others, Abdirahim Muudey, representative of Somalia, Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Professor of Economics, Yale University, Robert Opp of UNDP, Vincenzo Aquaro of UNDESA, Gemma Van Halderen of UNESCAP, Niall O' higgins of ILO, Paul Meyer of he Commons Project and Caroline Buckee of Harvard Public Health School. The panelists while highlighting the need for transformative actions on how data could be used to strike a balance between life and livelihood, also focused on the different elements of data revolution and acknowledged that timely, usable data is critical to informed decision-making, and meaningful international cooperation for effective utilisation of data, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Abdirahim Muudey shared his country's experience including introducing virtual training classes to ensure the development of post Covid-19 skills. N M Zeaul Alam, Senior Secretary, ICT Division, government of Bangladesh, in his closing remarks, highlighted the need for transformative approach for sharing data related experience. He further stressed the need to establish a \"common data sharing platform\" at local and global levels. The insights, views and ideas exchanged at the Virtual event is expected to inform all relevant stakeholders necessary understanding in their efforts towards accelerating post Covid recovery, and assessing its impact on social, economic and other aspects, as well as achieving SDGs. The panel discussion was followed by Q&A session. Rabab Fatima, moderated both the panel discussion and Q&A session.

{"title": "A little widget goes a long way", "body": "For all the talk about big apps and AI assistants, sometimes it is the smallest tools that save your day. Widgets, those little windows on your Android home screen, can do more for productivity than many full-featured apps. They give you instant access, quick reminders, and the satisfaction of checking things off without diving into menus. If your phone's home screen feels like wasted space, it might be time to put it to work. Here are five of the best widgets to help you stay focused and organised — and yes, all these widgets are available both on Android and iOS app stores. When it comes to note-taking, Google Keep is the steady companion most Android users already have but may not fully use. The Keep widget is the perfect balance of function and simplicity. Its \"Note collection\" widget lets you scroll through your notes right on the home screen. You can view all notes, pinned notes, or only those with a specific label. Each note shows its first few lines, so you can spot what you need at a glance. One tap opens it in full. The toolbar built into the widget is another small masterpiece. You can start a new note, make a checklist, dictate by voice, scribble a handwritten memo, or capture a photo straight into your notes. For quick ideas, the smaller \"Quick capture\" widget gives you those shortcuts without the clutter of existing notes. You can even pin a single note — say, a grocery list or daily affirmation — directly to your home screen. It is free, simple, and practical. Not every note needs to live in the cloud. Sometimes, you just need a virtual Post-it on your phone. ColorNote understands that perfectly. Add a ColorNote widget to your home screen, type what you need to remember, and it stays there like a bright sticky note. You can change its colour — yellow for reminders, pink for birthdays, blue for quotes you like. The effect is almost tactile; it feels like you have pasted a small note to your phone itself. There is also a cloud backup option, which is nice, but that is not the point. The charm lies in its simplicity. A quick glance at your phone and you remember what you were supposed to do. Sometimes, that is all the productivity boost you need. For those who live by to-do lists, Todoist is the gold standard. Its widget makes managing tasks feel effortless. You can create multiple Todoist widgets, each tied to a different view — your inbox, today's tasks, upcoming tasks, or specific projects. You can even customise how each one looks, choosing themes and allowing colours to adapt to your wallpaper. The best part is that you can check off tasks right from your home screen without opening the app. You can also add new ones on the fly, using quick options for due dates and priorities. Todoist's base version is free, while the Pro plan adds features for about £38 a year. For serious planners, it is well worth the price. The Google Discover feed often feels like it is guessing what you want to read. Feedly, on the other hand, lets you choose. It pulls articles from any sites you pick, creating your own personalised news feed. Add its widget to your home screen, and you can see the latest updates at a glance — whether it is tech news, design blogs, or politics. You can use Feedly to replace your Discover page entirely. It lets you follow what truly interests you and ignore the rest. For people who rely on staying updated without wasting time scrolling, it is a quiet revolution. If you have ever missed a birthday, meeting, or holiday because you forgot to open your calendar app, this one is for you. Google Calendar offers two elegant widgets — one shows a full month, and the other focuses on the coming days. Both bring clarity to your schedule without any effort. I prefer the monthly view, as it lets me see all events and tasks at once. With this on your home screen, there is no need for a paper calendar pinned to your wall. You will always know what is coming next, and that small awareness can make a big difference to how your day unfolds. apps / google / software / Android / iOS", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/little-widget-goes-long-way-1286366", "date": "2025-11-15T19:10:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 15 November, 2025, 07:10 pm Last modified: 15 November, 2025, 07:48 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 732, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:29.137606"}
{"title": "Huge cache of crude bombs, weapons seized in Shariatpur; 3 detained", "body": "Security forces have recovered a large cache of crude bombs (cocktails) and locally made sharp weapons from Shariatpur's Naria upazila in a joint pre-dawn operation, detaining three people in the process. The raid was conducted early today (2 February) based on the information about the stockpiling of bombs at a house in the Poragachha Bepari Kandi area of Moktererchar union under the upazila. During the operation, Mehedi Hasan, 25, Bacchu Peda, 60, and Roni Peda, 18, were detained. A joint team from Naria Police Station and the Bangladesh Army carried out the operation, seizing a total of 95 crude bombs stored in 12 buckets in Peda Mosque and from the houses of Khalil Peda, Jilu Madbar and Bacchu Peda. Several sharp weapons were also recovered from the scene. Akhil Ranjan Sarkar, sub-inspector of Naria Police Station, brought the recovered explosives, weapons and detainees to the police station around 8am. Police said the area has a history of similar incidents. In August last year, 60 crude bombs were recovered from the same locality and later defused by the Anti-Terrorism Unit. Moreover, a cocktail explosion in Bilaspur union of the neighbouring Zajira upazila on 8 January this year killed three people. Over the past three days, law enforcement also recovered 22 cocktails from three other locations in Naria upazila.

{"title": "Adani lawyers reach out after US moves to serve summons via email", "body": "Lawyers representing Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani initiated contact with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after learning that the regulator had moved a US court for permission to serve summons through email, reports Indian Express. On 22 January, a day after the SEC filed a motion in a New York court seeking authorisation for alternative service methods, the New York-based law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP contacted the SEC on behalf of the Adanis to discuss the issue. The following day, Adani's lawyers requested the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York to defer ruling on the SEC's motion while discussions with the regulator were under way. According to the Indian Express report, the court directed both sides to provide an update on their talks by 26 January. In response, Adani's lawyers filed a status report on 26 January, seeking additional time until 30 January to finalise their position. Adani group firms shed $12.5bn in market value after SEC seeks court nod to serve summons In their filing, Sullivan & Cromwell said counsel for both parties had exchanged comments on a proposed stipulation and that discussions were continuing with their clients, both of whom are based in India. Citing the time difference, the lawyers said the stipulation would be filed by the morning of 30 January. The New York court accepted the request. Earlier, on 21 January, the SEC sought court permission to serve notices on Gautam and Sagar Adani via email after its attempts to serve them under the Hague Convention proved unsuccessful. According to a report by The Indian Express, India's Ministry of Law and Justice twice declined to formally serve summons issued by the SEC, citing technical and legal objections. In April 2025, the ministry rejected the request, saying the authenticity of the documents could not be verified as the forwarding letter and model form lacked the required seals and signatures. After the SEC argued that the Hague Convention does not mandate such formalities and resubmitted the papers, the ministry again refused service last December, this time citing US law. In November 2024, the SEC filed civil charges, accusing Gautam and Sagar Adani of engaging in a bribery scheme during a September 2021 note offering by Adani Green that raised $750 million, including approximately $175 million from US investors. The Adani Group has repeatedly dismissed the SEC's allegations as baseless, adding that it will seek all possible legal recourse.

{"title": "A peek under the hood of Dhaka’s new traffic management system", "body": "For the past two months, Dhaka's traffic has been showing signs of discipline after years of chaos. The reason? Traffic signals have returned to key intersections in the capital, coupled with new diversions. Since August this year, the Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Traffic Division has reworked vehicle movement at 69 intersections by introducing simple, no-cost diversions. Furthermore, the Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA), with technical support from BUET, launched a pilot semi-automatic traffic signalling system at seven critical intersections: Hotel Intercontinental, Banglamotor, Sonargaon (Karwan Bazar), Farmgate, Bijoy Sarani, the Chief Adviser's Office, and Jahangir Gate. For a megacity of more than 20 million people and over 1.2 million registered vehicles, with numbers rising every year, the results offer optimism, even though experts say that a full solution is still distant. A semi-automatic system allows operators to manually adjust signal durations depending on traffic volume, a crucial feature in a city where sudden surges are the norm. According to drivers and traffic police alike, congestion has eased noticeably at these junctions, even as behavioural change lags behind infrastructure. Behind the visible lights is a coordinated operation involving multiple agencies. At each intersection, small control booths have been set up and are staffed by a controller, traffic police, and BUET technicians. Depending on traffic conditions, the signals can run automatically or be adjusted manually. BUET has trained DMP personnel to operate the system, while public awareness campaigns are underway through leaflets, social media, and television. The aim is not just to move vehicles, but to retrain road users long accustomed to chaos. The broader plan covers 23 intersections along the High Court–Airport corridor. The project is jointly funded by Dhaka North and Dhaka South city corporations, with an estimated total cost of Tk20 crore. Mohammad Rabiul Alam, Additional Executive Director (Transport Master Plan, Traffic, and Transport Infrastructure) at DTCA, said earlier attempts had failed because agencies worked in silos. \"Dhaka has tried signal systems several times, but they failed due to poor coordination,\" he said. \"This time, we are getting positive feedback. People need time to adapt; we are working closely with the city corporations and DMP,\" he added. The city corporations are responsible for installation and related infrastructure. Nayeem Rayhan Khan, Executive Engineer (Traffic Engineering Circle) at Dhaka North, said signals have already been installed at five intersections under the city corporation, with work ongoing at 10 more. \"We expect to finish by December. So far, Tk4 crore has been spent on fencing, footpath upgrades, and related work,\" he said. Dhaka South is also following a similar path. Rajib Khadem, Superintending Engineer (Traffic Engineering Circle), said two signals, Gulshan-1 and 2, are already operational, with six more being installed. \"This time, we are using locally developed technology, which has significantly reduced costs while showing visible results,\" he said. Both corporations expect the remaining 16 intersections to be completed by December. Alongside installation, they are focusing heavily on awareness campaigns through leaflets and social media, recognising that infrastructure alone cannot enforce discipline. The optimism surrounding the current initiative is shaped by a long history of disappointment. Since 2001, more than Tk150 crore has been spent on traffic signalling systems that eventually became decorative poles. Drivers ignored red lights, and traffic police reverted to manual control. Even in the late 1980s, traffic lights once functioned effectively at strategic intersections such as Shahbagh, ensuring vehicles stopped at red signals and pedestrians crossed safely. Later digitalisation efforts consumed hundreds of crores of taka and failed, undone by poor planning, unregulated vehicles, and a lack of enforcement. Professor Moazzem Hossain of BUET believes the lesson is finally being taken seriously. \"African countries, though economically behind us, have successfully improved traffic management through signalling systems,\" he said. \"It is a failure on our part that such measures were not implemented earlier.\" According to Moazzem, the current system can be developed gradually over the next two to three years, if discipline is enforced. \"Strict action must be taken against those who ignore the signals,\" he said. He outlined the conditions for success: buses restricted to designated parking areas, tighter control of battery-run rickshaws, and roads and footpaths cleared of hawkers. \"Dhaka has at least 100 major intersections; installing traffic signals in 50 of them in phases could instil much-needed discipline among road users,\" he added. Moazzem was blunt about the past. Most earlier projects, he said, were a waste of money due to flawed implementation, wrong solutions, and unregulated vehicles. \"If the running project continues with proper management, then it will work,\" he said. Momentum for the current effort gathered in October last year, when interim government Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met BUET professors Moazzem Hossain and Md Hadiuzzaman to discuss short-, medium-, and long-term traffic solutions. That meeting led to the decision to install new signal lights using locally developed technology, at a fraction of earlier costs. The result is not a miracle cure, but a visible shift. Intersections that once swallowed 15 minutes now release traffic in three. Rakibul Islam, a CNG driver, said traffic jams have visibly declined. \"We can cross intersections five times faster now. But we are still not used to relying on the signals. Unless a traffic officer waves us through, most drivers hesitate to move even when the light is green,\" he said. For him, another change matters just as much. \"The best thing is that there are no rickshaws on the main roads. They were the ones who used to slow traffic down,\" he added. Though not everyone is convinced the pressure on the roads has eased equally. Tuhin Ahmed, a Pathao motorcycle rider travelling from Farmgate towards Shahbagh, stopped at Karwan Bazar when the signal turned red. Most other vehicles did not. Eventually, a traffic officer had to intervene, using hand signals to halt the incoming flow. \"I thought the new signal system would bring order and ease the pressure on traffic police,\" Tuhin said. \"But it feels the same as before. Those of us who follow the signals just end up waiting longer.\" DMP traffic constable Selim Reza also acknowledged improvement but was clear about the limits. \"Most drivers still do not follow the signals willingly. But we strictly maintain the signals now,\" he said, suggesting that consistency, long missing from past attempts, may finally be taking root. For commuters, the impact is changing routines. Niladri Haque, who crosses Bijoy Sarani daily, said the difference is huge. \"Previously, this signal used to be a nightmare for us commuters. It often took 15–20 minutes, even sometimes more than 30 minutes, for us to cross. But now we can cross it in 2–3 minutes,\" she added.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/peek-under-hood-dhakas-new-traffic-management-system-1322171", "date": "2025-12-29T23:20:00+06:00", "author": "Anonno Afroz 29 December, 2025, 11:20 pm Last modified: 30 December, 2025, 01:52 am", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1105, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:35.726636"}
{"title": "Tea sales decline, traders fear losses", "body": "Last year, Bangladesh produced a record amount of tea and production has continued this year. However, tea sales have declined as most tea stalls, hotels, motels, and restaurants have been closed to curb the spread of Covid-19. As a result, unsold tea is piling up in warehouses and it has become a challenge for tea traders to keep garden activities operating. Traders say if the tea is stored in warehouses for a long time the quality of the tea will deteriorate. Moreover, the price of tea is lower this year than in other years. If the situation does not change, it will be impossible for them to pay the tea workers. They think it will not be possible to get out of this problem if they do not get incentives from the government. According to the Tea Board, the target for tea production in the country this year has been set at 7,59,40,000 kilogrammes. In the last five months this year, 1,28,46,000 kilogrammes have been produced. In the first five months of last year, the production was 1,62,81,000 kilogrammes. Kajal Hazra, director of the Srimangal Padma Tea Supply Store, said tea sales have dropped several times this year compared to last year. At the same time, the price of tea has also come down. The quality of the tea stored in his warehouse will deteriorate in just a few more days and he will face huge losses. Garden owners said a failure to sell tea will have an impact on workers' wages because all the expenses of the garden are met with the money that comes from tea sales. Piyush Kanti, general manager of Nahar Tea Garden, said, \"I have about 30,000 kilogrammes of tea stored at my warehouse. I can't sell it due to a lack of buyers. I have sold some amount but at an average price of Tk155 per kilogramme.\" \"I cannot get back the capital by selling tea at such a low price. Again, the wages of the workers cannot be kept in arrears. If it continues like this, I am thinking of how I will be able to pay the workers.\" GM Shibli, president of the Bangladesh Tea Parliament Sylhet Valley, said tea sales have dropped more than three times due to Covid-19. While good quality tea is being sold, general quality tea – which is sold in tea shops or restaurants – is being sold less. \"About half of the tea that goes up at auction remains unsold. Those involved in the industry will have to face huge challenges to continue production by providing salaries and other allowances,\" he said. Ahsan Habib, marketing officer of the Bangladesh Tea Board, said that last season (April 2019 to March 2020), 90.44 million kilogrammes of tea were sold at 45 auctions in Chattogram and Srimangal at an average price of Tk176.08 per kilogramme. So far this season, six auctions have been held in Chattogram, and three in Srimangal, and 6.66 million kilogrammes of tea have been sold at Tk155 per kilogramme. Sirajul Islam, manager of Hamidia Tea Garden, said, \"Last year, we produced 1,85,000 kilogrammes of tea. Although the production of tea is a little lower this year, I have already stored 25,000 kilogrammes of tea in the warehouse. \"I am in dire straits. I am struggling to pay the workers. Banks are also not giving loans. Only government incentives can save us from this problem,\" he added. Jahar Tarafder, member secretary of the Tea Planters and Traders Association of Bangladesh, said there were plans to hold 20 auctions in Srimangal this year. So far only three auctions have been held. Buyers' participation in the auctions has decreased – along with the price of tea. An official of the Tea Board said on condition of anonymity that most of the tea companies are owned by foreigners. If they cannot sell them now, they can six months later. The government has to first consider the industries that are currently on the verge of destruction, including dairy producers and farms, due to the pandemic. Although the salaries of many in the banking sector have come down, the salaries of tea gardeners have not come down yet. The situation of the tea garden is still very good, he added. Munir Ahmed, deputy director (planning) of the Bangladesh Tea Board, told The Business Standard that the ministry and the tea board are aware of the current situation and necessary steps will be taken. In 2019, the country's highest production in the tea industry broke the record of 165 years. The production target for that year was 80 million kilogrammes but by the end of the year, 96.07 million kilogrammes had been produced.

But courtesy of a solid opening partnership from Rory Burns and Dom Sibley, the English are right back in the match. England ended the first session on day four on 79-1 in their second innings, still 35 runs behind with Burns being the only casualty. Both Burns and England would have loved to end the session unscathed but still, stand-in skipper Ben Stokes should be content with where his team are at this position. England were put in to bat for 10 overs at the end of the third day after they managed to bowl West Indies out for 318. The visitors had a healthy 114-run lead in their bag and saw the hosts pass the third day with a cautious approach, scoring only 15 off the remaining overs. Burns and Sibley both decided to be slow and steady on the fourth day. Their approach paid dividends as they did not lose their wickets until Burns was sent back by Roston Chase on 42. The left-handed batsman tried to cut Chase but his mistimed effort only found John Campbell to hand the Caribbeans their only scalp of the session. Sibley and Joe Denly were at the crease at lunch on 31 and 1 respectively. Earlier, England were bowled out for 204 in their first innings on day two after almost the whole of the first day was washed out.

{"title": "Power and energy sector leads ADP spending, but structural risks loom large: Planning Commission report", "body": "Bangladesh's power and energy sector has emerged as a major performer in government expenditure, far outpacing most other ministries in implementing its development budget for the fiscal year (FY) 2024–25, , according to the first-ever \"State of the Economy\" report released by the General Economics Division (GED) of the Planning Commission. The report highlights that despite prevalent fiscal pressures and broader economic instability, the Power Division and the Energy and Mineral Resources Division demonstrated remarkably high efficiency in executing development projects. Data compiled by the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) shows that the Power Division achieved an impressive 98.10% utilisation of its Annual Development Programme (ADP) allocation, with the Energy Division closely following at 98.00%. Economy at 'critical juncture' despite regaining macroeconomic stability, warns Planning Commission report This performance significantly outpaced the national ADP utilisation rate of 67.85%. Moreover, self-financed projects within the Power Division also saw unusually strong execution, even exceeding 100% utilisation, a trend mirrored by several related agencies. Relevant ministry officials credit this surge to the momentum gained in FY25 for ongoing transmission upgrades, renewable energy expansion, and long-pending grid modernisation efforts. Deep-rooted structural challenges Despite standing out for efficient spending, the report issues a stark warning: deep-rooted structural challenges continue to threaten the long-term sustainability of the sector. \"These include rising subsidy burdens, fuel import dependency, delays in feasibility studies, and limited diversification of energy sources,\" the GED report cautioned. Overcapacity, particularly in oil- and coal-based plants, continues to inflate fixed payments, while global price volatility puts cumulative pressure on Bangladesh's already strained foreign exchange reserves. Tight monetary policy strains banking sector, slows deposit and credit growth: Planning Commission report The report recommends the phasing out of universal energy subsidies, proposing a shift towards targeted support exclusively for low-income households. It also calls for stronger feasibility assessments, accelerated adoption of renewable technologies, and wider use of public-private partnerships (PPP) to alleviate fiscal strain. Energy reliability and affordability will be crucial for industrial competitiveness and export-led growth as Bangladesh prepares for LDC graduation in 2026.

As the report notes, \"Strong spending does not guarantee strong outcomes\". Govt to clear gas, power dues in FY25 with unspent ADP funds The critical challenge for the sector now is converting rapid implementation into long-term resilience, ensuring that infrastructure growth aligns with economic realities, fiscal constraints, and the global energy transition.

{"title": "Workplace behaviours adapting to the new normal in the corporate world", "body": "The state of being \"normal\" is very mundane. It is assumed rather than pursued or looked upon with interest. However, this normal state binds everything together, keeps things moving and provides a sense of certainty. The much-talked-about term \"new normal\", is, hence, very insidious in its impact on our psyche as it is forcing us to rewire our conscious and subconscious mind to reach a state of normalcy. Talking from the perspective of how the global business is structured, this new normal is compelling business leaders around the world to envision a new supply chain model that will rely more on in-country production base, rather than sourcing it from abroad. In this context, the pandemic is only going to exacerbate the process of decoupling of the global supply chain. When the macro business environment is on the mend, it is only natural to see the micro issues like workplace behaviour also evolve into a new normal. In this article, I would highlight some behavioural changes that we can expect to see in our workplaces in the coming days. \"Seeing is believing\" would be changed to \"trusting is believing\". We would get habituated with digital lives at both personal and professional fronts where one will be buying cloths without seeing it, ordering food without tasting it, hiring workers without meeting in person, and interacting with people without experiencing their emotional expression. So, the new normal will be built on \"trust\". The idea of \"there is no plan B\" might be replaced by \"cater for uncertainty\". The daring attitude towards result achievement by the people with aggression might fall flat seeing how uncertainty can diminish a strong business plan. Therefore, preparing for a plan B even before a plan A would be the \"new normal\" with a firm focus on \"business continuity management\". The expectation of \"F2F training\" will be replaced by \"online learning intervention\". Peoples' attitudes towards learning will change as they will find value in digital training. Receiving world-class in short time and spending less money will become the new trend as travels will be restricted. Therefore, the learning enthusiasm will go up and it will emerge as a leisure time activity for young minds. \"Shaking hands will be replaced by \"bowing or nodding\". The shaking of hands to encourage someone for a job well-done, or in case of seeing someone after ages, or while celebrating the success of team-mates will no longer be entertained. We might see people bowing or nodding their heads to each other instead of hand-shakes in these situations. \"Fixed office timing\" would be replaced by \"roaster or flexi hour\". To avoid gathering at the entrance of an office, offices will be practising \"flexible office hour\" as a new normal. It would also ensure the physical distancing during the rush period of commute to and from the office. Attending office in segmented percentage might also become a widely accepted office norm. \"Attending someone during sicknesses\" would be replaced by \"calling for support only\". We stand by our colleagues or friends at workplaces if they fall sick. We sit beside them, talk to them to give them comfort. However, in the new normal, people will call out for support right away. Hence demonstration of fellow feelings and compassionate behaviour will change in the new normal. Managing \"mental health\" would become as important as maintaining \"physical health\". As the regular conduct at office and home would get disrupted in the post-pandemic situation, hence managing mental health would become critical to keep the mind stable at work. Mental well-being will be pursued just like the physical well-being in this context. \"Social distancing\" will become \"physical distancing\". The \"social distancing\" will be very soon be rephrased as \"physical distancing\", since we do not create social distance - rather a physical distance - to avoid the probable contamination. Therefore, maintaining physical distancing will get more traction going forward. In fact, \"physical distancing\" would get widely accepted as gentlemanly conduct or behaviour. Adapting to the new normal in the workplaces is going to strain our psychological muscles. In this new normal, we need to collaborate even more intimately in the workplace. We need to be a lot more emotionally engaged with each other to overcome the stressfulness of this new normal. Let us do it together one more time, shall we!

{"title": "How to survive the world's longest flights in style", "body": "Eight hours from Sydney to Singapore? It's a doddle. 12 hours from Hong Kong to London? No sweat. With a high-tech assist from Airbus and Boeing, airlines are steadily pushing the boundaries of long-distance flying. Even the language is being redefined. The new frontier is the \"ultra-long-range\" flight, where globe-striding jets regularly tackle journeys of more than 16,000km (9,942 miles). For passengers, that translates to 18-plus hours in the air. But for many business travellers, even those non-stop marathons prove the superior alternative to airport lay-overs halfway along the route. So if you're in for the long haul, here's the best way to handle it. Singapore to New York (Singapore Airlines) Average time: 18 hours 35 minutes Singapore Airlines originally flew non-stop between Singapore and New York (to be technically correct, the Manhattan-adjacent Newark) from 2004 to 2013, until rising oil costs grounded its gas-guzzling Airbus A340 jets. New fuel-efficient Airbus A350 jetliners helped tilt the economics back in Singapore Airlines' favour, with the route restarted in October 2018. With SQ21 wheels-up from Singapore near midnight and reaching Newark around 6 am, passengers, see two long \"nights\" book-ending a brief sunrise near Japan. Members of Singapore Airlines' elite Solitaire PPS Club can make the best start to this marathon by visiting the SilverKris first-class lounge at Changi Airport's Terminal 3 to enjoy a few glasses of Piper-Heidsieck Rare Millesime 2002, which sells for around 300 Singapore dollars ($216) per bottle. Surprisingly, there are no first-class suites on this flight: only 67 lie-flat business class seats and 94 premium economy recliners. So how do you spend close to 19 non-stop hours in business class, short of a Stilnox-induced coma? Savvy travellers think ahead. Singapore Airlines' online Book the Cook service lets you choose from an extensive selection of meals before you fly. There are a staggering 49 dishes which you won't see on the in-flight dining menu, headlined by the ever-popular Lobster Thermidor but also embracing Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese and Indian dishes. Singapore Airlines' smartphone app also lets you browse the in-flight video and music library ahead of your flight, to create a personalized playlist which is synchronized via WiFi with your setback screen once you step onto the plane. This is especially handy when you realize that from start to finish, you could spend the flight watching all eight Harry Potter movies or listening to every song ever recorded by The Beatles, twice over. Review: I Was on the World's Longest Flight. It Was Brutal But Better Doha to Auckland (Qatar Airways) Average time: 17 hours The world's second-longest flight sports the world's best business class. This is the Qsuite, a bespoke Qatar Airways design with first class-style sliding doors. For 17 hours, these wonderfully well-appointed suites become a cosy crib for relaxing or a private cocoon for sleeping. A staggered layout sees some seats facing backwards but positioned closer to the window rather than the door, which gives you more of a private jet feel. (If you want to select those seats when making your booking, choose the A or K seats at rows 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10.) If you're travelling with your partner, request one of the paired middle seats which can convert into a double bed, then slip into the airline-supplied PJs and snuggle down. The long flight also affords plenty of time to work your way through Qatar Airways' extensive \"dine on demand\" menu, which lets passengers order any dish at any time during the flight — perfect if your timezone-addled stomach fancies a mezze platter breakfast at 4 pm. Perth to London (Qantas) Average time: 17 hours Sophisticated real-time flight planning software helps Qantas regularly shave slabs of time off the only direct flight linking Australia and the UK — it's come down as low as 15¼ hours on the return London-Perth leg. This is the world's longest Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight and will be joined in April 2020 by Qantas' new Brisbane-Chicago service. It also benefits from one of the world's best Boeing 787 business-class seats: A spacious \"business suite\" with plenty of room to spread out your work en route plus a 16-inch HD screen. Thankfully Qantas is big on boxed sets. Downton Abbey is tailor-made viewing for the trip to London, although a special HBO channel includes entire seasons of high-profile shows such as Game of Thrones, Big Little Lies and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Boeing 787's cabin technology helps mitigate the effects of jet lag through lower effective altitude, higher humidity and cleaner filtered air, while Qantas has partnered with chef Neil Perry and Sydney University to develop a special in-flight menu of nourishing metabolism-friendly \"wellness\" meals. Dubai to Auckland (Emirates) Average time: 16 hours 30 minutes With one of Emirates' double-decker Airbus A380s featuring on the flagship New Zealand service, well-heeled passengers can find a haven in the superjumbo's private first-class suites. Emirates was among the pioneers of first-class A380 cabins with sliding doors, and the first to add showers — two of them, exclusive to the 14 first-class suites — for a quick freshen-up before landing. Combine this with a \"dine on demand\" menu and there's little reason to venture our of this rarefied realm. Well, there's one reason: head towards the rear of the superjumbo's upper deck and you'll find a cocktail bar where you can mingle with colleagues consigned to business class. Ask the bartender for the drink of your choice or have them surprise you with their favourite in-flight tipple, add some conversation and the hours will fly by.

{"title": "Trump says Putin agrees to pause Kyiv strikes amid harsh cold", "body": "US President Donald Trump said on Thursday (29 January) that Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed to a personal request to halt attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, after Moscow's strikes left millions without heating during an \"extreme\" cold snap. Trump's claim comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine's power infrastructure have disrupted light, heating and water supplies, with temperatures plummeting and leaving the war-battered country facing a fresh humanitarian crisis. The Kremlin did not immediately confirm any truce, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Trump and said he was counting on Washington to secure the pause in attacks. \"Because of the cold, extreme cold... I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this,\" Trump told a cabinet meeting at the White House. \"They've never experienced cold like that. And I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week. And he agreed to do that, and I have to tell you, it was very nice,\" he added. Ukraine's state weather agency on Thursday forecast a drastic dip in temperatures to as low as minus 30C in the coming days as authorities race to restore services. Trump, who met Putin in Alaska last year amid great fanfare but without achieving any breakthrough, said he trusted the Russian leader to honour the agreement. \"People said, 'Don't waste the call. You're not going to get that.' And he did it,\" said Trump, without specifying when the conversation took place, or when the purported truce would start. 'Make this happen' Zelensky, who met Trump in Davos last week despite patchy relations since their Oval Office bust-up nearly a year ago, thanked the US president for his \"important statement.\" \"We hope the United States can make this happen,\" the Ukrainian leader said. The pause had initially been discussed last weekend during three-way talks in Abu Dhabi between Russia, Ukraine and the United States, Zelensky said. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also welcomed what he termed \"efforts in favour of a truce\". Merz at the same time stressed that \"the systematic and brutal destruction of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure by Russian attacks\" was \"still ongoing\", which he condemned \"in the strongest terms\", his spokesman, Stefan Kornelius, said. A second round of trilateral negotiations in Abu Dhabi is scheduled to begin on Sunday as Trump pushes his plan to end the nearly four-year-old invasion by Russia. Putin met Emirati counterpart Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Moscow on Thursday ahead of those talks. The UAE has emerged as a key mediator in the war. The talks come as Ukraine faces one of its most difficult periods since Russia's February 2022 invasion, with Moscow's forces grinding slowly on in the east and bitter cold closing in. Zelensky warned in an evening address on Wednesday of fresh Russian attacks on energy facilities. Russian attacks killed six people in central and southern Ukraine on Thursday, regional authorities and emergency services said. But Trump has repeatedly said in recent days that he believes a ceasefire is possible. At the cabinet meeting on Thursday, Trump said there had been \"a lot of progress\" in the talks. Trump's roaming envoy Steve Witkoff said he was also confident there would be a truce, saying that the US president had a \"friendship\" with his Russian counterpart. \"The president, what he said, is true,\" he said in response to an AFP reporter at the premiere of a documentary about Trump's wife Melania. \"And I think that he and Vladimir Putin have a friendship, and I think that allows them to talk and to have a relationship that hopefully will help things out here, get to a settlement and save a lot of lives.\" Russia-Ukraine conflict / Donald Trump", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/trump-says-putin-agrees-pause-kyiv-strikes-amid-harsh-cold-1347831", "date": "2026-01-30T11:25:00+06:00", "author": "BSS/AFP 30 January, 2026, 11:25 am Last modified: 30 January, 2026, 11:35 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 627, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:54.598524"}
{"title": "The world's largest Confederate monument faces renewed calls for removal", "body": "Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial, a nine-story-high bas-relief sculpture carved into a sprawling rock face northeast of Atlanta, is perhaps the South's most audacious monument to its pro-slavery legacy still intact. Despite long-standing demands for the removal of what many consider a shrine to racism, the giant depiction of three Confederate heroes on horseback still towers ominously over the Georgia countryside, protected by state law. The monument - which reopens on Independence Day weekend after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close for weeks - has faced renewed calls for removal since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died during an arrest by a white police officer who pinned his neck to the ground with a knee. The brutality of Floyd's death, captured on cellphone video, triggered a national outcry against racial injustice, and revived a long-simmering battle between those demanding the removal of racist symbols from the public sphere, and those who believe monuments honor the tradition and history of the South. \"Here we are in Atlanta, the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement and still we have the largest Confederate monument in the world,\" said Gerald Griggs, a vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, which staged a march last week calling for the carving to be scraped from the mountainside. \"It's time for our state to get on the right side of history.\" The sheer scale of the monument makes its removal a daunting task to contemplate. Longer than a 100-yard American football field, it features the likenesses of Jefferson Davis, the president of the 11-state Confederacy, and two of its legendary military leaders, Robert E. Lee and Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, notched in a relief 400 feet above ground. The Sons of Confederate Veterans is an organization that staunchly defends Stone Mountain and other Confederate statues and emblems. Dedicated to teaching the \"Southern Cause,\" according to its website, it believes their removal is akin to purging American history. The Southern or \"Lost Cause of the Confederacy\" holds that the war was fought over a heroic, but lost, effort to defend states' rights to secede from the Union in the face of Northern aggression, rather than the preservation of slavery. Martin O'Toole, an official of the Georgia chapter, said the monument is not a totem of racism at all. It's history, plain and simple, he says. \"It's three men on horses,\" O'Toole said. \"What's racist about that?\" Maurice J. Hobson, an associate professor of African American Studies at Georgia State University, counters this, describing the Southern Cause as \"a false history\" that downplays slavery's role in the Civil War. He said the Confederate leaders were traitors to the United States who fought to hold onto a Southern economy that depended on slavery. All three men featured on the monument, Davis, Lee and Jackson, were slave owners. \"The whole of Stone Mountain was erected to show what some white Georgians revered,\" he said. Stone Mountain has long held symbolism for white supremacists. The Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that was formed by Confederate Army veterans and has a history of lynchings and terror against Black people, held its rebirth ceremony atop mountain in 1915 with flaming crosses. Klansmen still hold occasional gatherings in the shadows of the edifice, albeit now met with protesters behind police tape. Many of those cross-burnings took place on or around July 4. The monolithic monument was proposed more than a century ago and had numerous false starts over the years. But with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, segregationist officials in the state pushed for the creation the Stone Mountain Memorial Association in 1958 and purchased the park. The carving was completed in 1972. \"This debate has been going on for years, and we're sensitive to it,\" John Bankhead, a spokesman for the group, said. \"We want to tell history as it is, not as some say it is.\" In the past, others have suggested putting more balance into the monument. There was a proposal to build a memorial to Martin Luther King Jr, the Atlanta-based civil rights icon, but the Sons of Confederate Veterans, as well the King family, rejected the idea. Even though that idea floundered, Hobson advocates adding more carvings to the rock face, including African American historical figures and civil rights leaders. \"It needs to be put in a context that forces a conversation, a serious conversation,\" he said. \"The easiest way to rectify it, is surround it.\" Griggs of the NAACP said that the civil rights group has consulted with stone masons who said it would cost about $300,000 to $400,000 to remove the towering images. \"Take it down,\" he said. \"Restore the mountain to its original condition.\" Black Lives Matter Protest / Confederate Monument / US", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/worlds-largest-confederate-monument-faces-renewed-calls-removal-101530", "date": "2020-07-04T09:25:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 04 July, 2020, 09:25 am Last modified: 04 July, 2020, 09:32 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 799, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:56.814727"}
{"title": "Australia suspends extradition treaty, extends visas for Hong Kong citizens", "body": "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced measures to assist Hong Kong citizens start a new life in Australia, including extending visas by five years, after Beijing imposed a new security law on the Asian financial hub. Morrison also suspended an extradition agreement with Hong Kong. Under the security law Hong Kong suspects can be sent for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China. Morrison said the new national security law introduced last week in Hong Kong was a fundamental change of circumstances and Australia would suspend the extradition agreement. \"There will be citizens of Hong Kong who may be looking to move elsewhere, to start a new life somewhere else, to take their skills, their businesses,\" Morrison said. He announced visa measures that would assist Hong Kong citizens already in Australia to stay. Hong Kong students who graduate in Australia will have the opportunity to stay for five years and apply for permanent residency after that time. Hong Kong citizens on temporary work visas in Australia would also be eligible to extend these for five years, and later apply for permanent residency. Morrison said there are 10,000 Hong Kong citizens in Australia on student visas or temporary work visas. Australia also made a pitch for international financial services, consulting and media businesses with regional headquarters in Hong Kong to relocate to Australia, and said it would offer incentives and visas packages to relocate staff. \"We want them to look to Australia, to come, to set up shop,\" said acting immigration minister Alan Tudge. Australia changed its travel advisory for Hong Kong, where around 100,000 Australians live and work, to say \"reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong\" if they are concerned about the new law. The travel advice for Hong Kong warns Australians \"may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds\". Hong Kong's new security law punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. The new law has pushed China's freest city onto a more authoritarian path and drawn condemnation from some Western governments, lawyers and rights groups. Canada last week announced it would suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of the security legislation and could boost immigration from the former British colony. Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne held a teleconference overnight with her counterparts in the Five Eyes security arrangement, which includes the UK, U.S., New Zealand and Canada, about Hong Kong and the new security law, Payne and UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter. australia / Hongkong / China / national security laws", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/australia-suspends-extradition-treaty-extends-visas-hong-kong-citizens-103828", "date": "2020-07-09T10:25:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 09 July, 2020, 10:25 am Last modified: 09 July, 2020, 10:29 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 439, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:24:59.045692"}

{"title": "Only 9 public hospitals get budget allocation for oxygen", "body": "Among the 27 government hospitals with central oxygen lines, only nine have received budget allocation for oxygen supply at a time when Covid-19 patients are scrambling for respiratory supportive measures. Many Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment at the Kuwait-Bangladesh Friendship Government Hospital, Kurmitola General Hospital and Mugda Medical College and Hospital – three flagship medical facilities for coronavirus patients in the capital. Though the hospitals have central oxygen supply, there is no allocation for oxygen in the national budget for the 2020-21 fiscal year. The Satkhira 250-bed District Hospital is the lone public medical facility in Khulna division with central oxygen supply. But, like it, no district headquarter hospital is on the oxygen allocation list in the new budget. Additional Secretary (Budget) to the Health Service Division Rashada Akhtar said the hospitals who asked for oxygen supply funds got the budget allocation. \"Rest of the public hospitals will be able to avail the fund for oxygen if they send demand letters,\" she added. Budget allocation analysis of the division shows oxygen supply got Tk23.35 crore in the 2020-21 fiscal year. The allocation was Tk8.24 crore for seven hospitals in the main budget for the 2019-20 fiscal year. However, in the revised budget of the recently concluded fiscal year, five hospitals got Tk7.24 crore for oxygen. Though the health sector got a shot in the arm in the new budget with a Tk22,883.86 crore allocation, which is Tk4,272 crore more than the previous year, the lion's share of it will be spent for salaries, other payments and administrative expenditure. For instance, Tk148 crore has been allocated for car fuel of health officials in the current budget, while medicines for patients will cost the government only Tk490 crore. In the new budget, medical and surgical equipment purchase gets only Tk28 crore more than the revised budget of the previous year. On condition of anonymity, a top Health Service Division official said the district hospitals should have oxygen supply ensured as the government ordered the healthcare facilities to admit both Covid-19 positive and other patients. \"The block allocation of Tk10,000 crore in the new budget will meet the extra expenses, including oxygen for coronavirus patients. The hospitals will get their bills once they send letters of demand,\" the official said. Doctors said most of the Covid-19 patients suffer from flu-like symptoms while only a few require respiratory supportive measures like ventilators, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and oxygen supply through high-flow nasal cannula. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in the country in last March, many alleged that they lost their dearest ones as they could not manage to admit patients to a medical facility with high-pressure oxygen supply. Amid the oxygen supply crunch, many bought oxygen cylinders at a high price and stocked those at home beforehand. On July 2, banker Masum Ahmed was desperately looking for an oxygen cylinder for his ailing father-in-law. After failing to manage any, he admitted the elderly man to Kurmitola General Hospital, and the patient breathed his last just hours after admission. \"I could not promptly manage a cylinder. At the hospital, there was no ICU bed available either. The man died almost without any treatment,\" Masum told The Business Standard. Dr Mazharul Haque, a World Health Organization doctor in Bangladesh, said it is necessary to develop a central oxygen storage system at medical college hospitals and district level medical facilities. \"Hospitals that already have central oxygen supply lines must get funds immediately from the block allocation,\" he added. The government moved to set up central oxygen lines at public hospitals following the coronavirus outbreak and five hospitals have gotten the new lines so far. Oxygen supply lines are being installed in 45 more hospitals, and the work is likely to end within this month. However, the budget did not separately allocate funds for the new oxygen line installation. Mohammad Aminur Rahman, chief technical manager to the National Electro Medical Equipment Maintenance, Workshop, and Training Center, said they have installed oxygen lines at three hospitals since the virus outbreak. Aminur said installation of oxygen lines is currently going on at 23 hospitals. They will begin work at 22 other medical facilities next week.

{"title": "Potatoes worth Tk67cr exported in 2019-20 FY", "body": "Although the Covid-19 outbreak has had a major impact on the export of garments and other products, the export of potatoes has been normal. Due to the huge demand for Bangladeshi potatoes in the world market, the export flow of this agricultural product has been normal. Deputy Director Mohammad Asaduzzaman Bulbul of the Chittagong Port Plant Quarantine Centre told The Business Standard that although all other government departments were closed on public holidays due to Covid-19, their office was open to keep the export of agricultural products normal. As a result, potato exports were normal during the pandemic. According to potato exporters, the demand for Bangladeshi potatoes is increasing day by day in the world. If this demand is exploited and various initiatives are taken, Bangladesh will be able to earn a lot of foreign exchange by exporting this item. According to the Chittagong Port Plant Quarantine Centre, 31,402 tonnes of potatoes were exported through Chittagong seaport in the just-concluded 2019-20 fiscal year. Besides, 32,089 tonnes of potatoes were exported in 2018-19 and 29,359 tonnes in 2017-18. Dr Ferdousi Begum, head of Ferdous Biotech Pvt Ltd, a potato exporter, told The Business Standard that 95 percent of the potatoes exported from Bangladesh go through the Chittagong seaport, and the remaining five percent through Banglabandha. The average price of potatoes exported to different countries of the world is about $250 per tonne. If the government pays special attention to the export of agricultural products, as it does to readymade garments, the volume of exports will increase further, she added. She said a separate zone needs to be set up at Chittagong port for shipping potatoes. Besides, extortion in road transport, toll waiver, assessment of potato quality in the presence of agricultural officials, government initiatives for new companies to take initiative in potato export will play a huge role in export earnings if government agencies are more sincere in potato export. Sheikh Abdul Quader, managing director of Agriconcern Ltd, a large potato exporter in Bangladesh, told The Business Standard that Bangladesh has been able to maintain the continuity of potato exports even during the pandemic. He expects the volume of potato exports to increase further in the current financial year, which is undoubtedly positive for the country. About 80 percent of the potatoes that are exported through Chittagong seaport go to Malaysia. Besides, potatoes are exported to various other countries including Vietnam, Maldives, Bahrain, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Brunei, Oman, Hong Kong, Qatar, etc. According to the Plant Quarantine Centre, Bangladesh exports four types of potatoes. These include 50-150-gram round potatoes called Ganala, Diamond potatoes are oval-shaped and weigh more than 50 grams, round Manila potatoes weigh 60-120 grams and red potatoes weigh more than 80 grams. Data from the Department of Agricultural Extension reveals that the country is producing an average of about 8 million tonnes of potatoes against the demand of four million tonnes. Potato farmers do not get a fair price as the production has doubled against the demand. Being unable to store it in cold storage, as an alternative in the hope of a fair price during the production season, potato farmers often sell the item at a low price. If the government is more proactive in exporting surplus potatoes, the people concerned think that potato export can create a milestone in business.

{"title": "From reels to real dialogue: How Tarique Rahman is recasting BNP's relationship with youth", "body": "Today, Justice Shahabuddin Park did not look like a political venue. Children wandered past, joggers slowed to watch, and curious passers-by gathered at a distance as a circle of young people sat across from a man long seen as distant from street-level politics. There were no barricades sealing the park off from the city, no stage separating leader from listener. At around 2pm, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman chose to meet the youth of Bangladesh not behind closed doors, but in the open air and, symbolically, on equal ground. For years, a widely accepted belief had taken root in Bangladesh's political discourse: that the BNP had little room for young voices. That perception only hardened after the July Uprising, as scepticism grew over whether traditional parties could still speak the language of a generation raised on social media, economic uncertainty and political disillusionment. Yet, over the past weeks, that stereotype has begun to fracture, largely because of a deliberate shift in how Tarique Rahman is choosing to engage. His official election campaign did not begin with a mass rally or a fiery speech, but with a conversation. In Sylhet, he launched his campaign through \"The Plan: Youth Policy Dialogue with Tarique Rahman\", an interactive session where young people questioned him directly on education, employment and governance. Rather than rehearsed slogans, the focus was policy and, more importantly, listening. That tone carried forward to Gulshan, where the chairman met the ten winners of BNP's national reel-making competition, \"Amar Bhabnay Bangladesh\". The competition itself was an experiment in political engagement. Held between 16 and 25 December 2025, it invited citizens to submit one-minute reels on how they imagine Bangladesh's future. Eleven themes were offered, from family cards and farmer cards to health, education, employment, environmental protection, sports, expatriate welfare, women's empowerment and the vision of a corruption-free Bangladesh. More than 2,200 reels were submitted by participants from across the country, reflecting a level of digital participation rarely seen in party-led initiatives. Evaluation was split between public voting, which accounted for 30%, and a jury board, responsible for the remaining 70%. From this process, ten winners were selected, not merely to receive recognition, but to be heard. Photo: BNP media cell Their reward was not a cheque or a certificate, but a seat across the table from the BNP chairman himself. At Justice Shahabuddin Park, the discussion unfolded without formality. The park remained open throughout the session, reinforcing the sense that this was not a controlled political spectacle but a genuine exchange. One by one, the young winners spoke offering opinions on policy priorities, debating how proposals such as family cards and farmer cards should be implemented, and openly disagreeing where they felt improvement was needed. Tarique Rahman listened, responded, and in several moments, pushed them back with questions of his own. He shared his reflections on the reels, praised their creativity, and offered guidance on how young people can move beyond online expression to meaningful civic contribution. The message he returned to repeatedly was simple but pointed: the future Bangladesh must be led by its youth, not merely represented by them. Change, he stressed, cannot be outsourced to a single leader or party; it must be driven from the front by a generation willing to take responsibility. Sitting beside him was his daughter, Barrister Zaima Rahman, whose presence added another layer to the symbolism of the event. Having recently taken part in programmes on national policymaking that reflect the hopes and aspirations of younger citizens, she represented a bridge between political legacy and generational renewal. The father-daughter duo listened together, responded together, and later posed for photographs with the winners. Earlier in the day, at a press conference, BNP Election Steering Committee spokesperson and chairman's adviser Mahdi Amin had framed the meet-and-greet as part of a broader attempt to incorporate public ideas into state-building. He reiterated that proposals such as family cards and farmer cards are intended to support women's empowerment and farmers' prosperity, and warned of fraudulent groups demanding money in the name of these initiatives. If BNP assumes state power through the people's votes, he pledged, these cards will be distributed entirely free of charge to rightful beneficiaries, urging citizens to report any attempts at exploitation. What set the Gulshan event apart was not just its content, but its form. Bangladesh's major political parties have rarely allowed this level of one-to-one engagement between a party chairman and non-political youth, especially outside controlled venues. There was no expectation of loyalty, no screening of opinions. The ten participants did not speak as activists, but as citizens — and were treated as such. This approach reflects a noticeable shift in BNP's campaign strategy. BNP is now experimenting with smaller, policy-focused interactions. The launch of election and WhatsApp hotlines to receive voter complaints and opinions further signals an attempt to institutionalise feedback rather than fear it. Critically, these engagements are not being framed as symbolic gestures alone. By starting his campaign with youth dialogues and continuing it through platforms shaped by young people themselves, Tarique Rahman appears intent on reshaping both the image and internal culture of his party. The emphasis is less on inherited political allegiance and more on participatory politics, a language younger voters are more inclined to understand. For BNP, and for Tarique Rahman personally, the message was unmistakable, the future is not waiting to be addressed at rallies alone. It is already speaking, sometimes in one-minute reels, sometimes on a park bench, and increasingly, it expects to be heard.

{"title": "Arrested sex trafficking gang-leader owns four hotels in Dubai: CID", "body": "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of police has arrested the alleged gang-leader of a sex trafficking racket which forced hundreds of girls from Bangladesh into prostitution in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Azam Khan, the alleged mastermind of the gang, owns four hotels in Dubai – Hotel Fortune Royal, Fortune Grand Hotel, City Tower Hotel, and Fortune Pearl Hotel and Dance Club. The first three hotels are four-star standard, while the last one is three-star. Making the disclosure at a press briefing in the CID headquarters on Sunday, Deputy Inspector General (Organised Crime Unit) Imtiaz Ahmed, said, \"The UAE recently expelled Azam from the country after discovering his illegal activities behind his hotel business.\" The CID's organised crime team also arrested two other people involved in the human trafficking racket, who forced young women into prostitution in Dubai after trafficking them using tourist visas. The arrestees – Anwar Hossain and Al Amin – have been identified as associates of Azam Khan. The police, however, did not disclose the date and location of the arrests. At the press briefing, the CID official said, \"The UAE had informed the Bangladesh Embassy about Azam Khan's sex trafficking racket. Later, the embassy seized his passport and other documents. \"Earlier this year, he was deported to Bangladesh and was trying to escape to a neighbouring country by getting another passport. However, the CID managed to track him down and arrest him. Azam and his gang had been trafficking young women to Dubai for years.\" How did the racket operate? According to CID sources, hundreds of women – mostly aged between 20 and 25 – were trafficked to the UAE, some free of cost. In first stage in Dubai, Azam Khan and his racket got the victims jobs in their four hotels. During the second stage, they forced the trafficked women into working in dance bars, and soon they ended up getting involved in prostitution. \"The gang tortured any trafficked women who refused to get involved in dance bars and prostitution,\" said DIG Imtiaz Ahmed, adding, \"We filed a case at Lalbagh police station on July 2, and Azam Khan has confessed to involvement in the human trafficking racket.\" Providing further details about the racket, the CID official said, \"Azam has trafficked more than a thousand women in the last eight years from Bangladesh, luring them with jobs with a salary of Tk50,000 per month. \"Several travel agencies, two foreign airlines, and more than 50 brokers have worked as his associates in Bangladesh. Azam himself used to work on human trafficking. His two brothers also work as his accomplices and they have gone into hiding in Dubai.\" The Bangladesh Embassy in the UAE confiscated Azam's passport after the country brought allegation of human trafficking against him, DIG Imtiaz said, adding that Azam was sent back to Bangladesh with an out pass later. \"Azam's mobile phone contains audio clips of over hundred women crying to return to Bangladesh,\" he added.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/crime/arrested-sex-trafficking-gang-leader-owns-four-hotels-dubai-cid-105307", "date": "2020-07-12T22:10:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 12 July, 2020, 10:10 pm Last modified: 13 July, 2020, 12:30 am", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 493, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:25:11.692223"}
{"title": "Bangladesh charts a course for shipbuilding excellence", "body": "The ocean and its adjoining seas and rivers cover approximately three-fourths of the Earth's surface, serving as vital ecosystems and economic arteries. With over 80% of global trade transported via maritime routes, the ocean plays a pivotal role in international commerce. It is also a source of livelihood for millions, a habitat for diverse marine species, and a critical regulator of the planet's climate. Shipping, ocean protection, and economic growth are deeply interconnected. Since ships are the only means of moving goods across oceans, making shipping safer and more efficient is crucial. Shipbuilding, therefore, plays a key role, and Bangladesh has a strong opportunity to expand in this sector by pursuing smart improvements. To support this advancement, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ministry of Finance have partnered with the Association of Export Oriented Shipbuilding Industries of Bangladesh (AEOSIB) to develop a skilled workforce. Since the inception of the initiative in 2016, AEOSIB has trained around twenty thousand individuals across seven trades through technical institutes and shipyards nationwide. Many graduates have secured employment both domestically and internationally, including placements in the Middle East, Singapore and Malaysia. Others have ventured into entrepreneurship. Following the successful completion of Phase I, AEOSIB has launched Phase II under the Skills for Industry Competitiveness and Innovation Program (SICIP). The current phase targets 6,000 trainees for basic and mid-level courses. Notably, welding and fabrication programmes are assessed by international classification societies such as Bureau Veritas (BV) and DNV-GL. In the advanced welding course (2,500 trainees), approximately 70% of successful participants are expected to secure overseas employment opportunities, reflecting strong global demand. Captain M.

{"title": "Spain's deadly rail accidents prompt maintenance investment debate", "body": "A series of accidents in one week on Spain's railways, including one of the deadliest in Europe, has left the country reeling and put the spotlight on whether investment to maintain the network is keeping pace with surging passenger demand. Nearly 40 million passengers used a high-speed train in Spain in 2024, almost double the 2019 number and pushing the overall use of Spain's railway system to a record 549 million, according to data from the competition authority. However, the high usage on Europe's largest high-speed rail network means more wear and tear, and data, reports and experts point to a focus on expanding the system, rather than on investment in maintenance, which is lower than in other large European countries. Network is a victim of its own success \"Spain's high-speed rail is dying from its own success. It's under greater strain, and it's starting to break down,\" said Salvador Garcia-Ayllon, a professor at Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena. A high-speed collision in the southern Andalusia region last Sunday killed 45 people, while two days later a driver was killed and four passengers seriously injured after a containment wall fell on the track after heavy rains near Barcelona derailing a commuter train. A second train also derailed near Barcelona due to a rock on the line, while a fourth collided with a crane arm in southeastern Spain, causing minor injuries to six passengers. Preliminary findings from the accident in Andalusia showed a fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before the train derailed, rail accident investigating body CIAF said on Friday. \"I accept and acknowledge that there should be a debate on whether it is necessary to increase the amount allocated to maintenance,\" Transport Minister Oscar Puente said in his first press conference after the accident. \"What I do ask is that it be separated from the accident,\" which occurred on a stretch of track that was renovated last May and inspected on 7 January. Maintenance spending lags European peers European Commission data shows Spain's maintenance investment in its roughly 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of high-speed lines has lagged large European peers, despite an unmatched drive to expand the network. Spain spent an average of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.76 billion) a year from 2018 to 2022 on its high-speed network, more than any other country. However, the vast majority went to new infrastructure with only some 16% earmarked for maintenance, renewal and upgrades. That compares with between 34% to 39% spent by France, Germany and Italy, whose networks are far less extensive, according to the Commission data. Maintenance spending on Spain's high-speed network needs to increase to 150,000 euros per km from the current 110,000 euros, according to estimates by Jose Trigueros, president of the Association of Roads and Civil Engineers, who said the maintenance budget also needs to be higher for conventional lines. The main Spanish train drivers' union SEMAF called a three-day nationwide strike to protest against what it said is \"the constant deterioration of the railway system\" and to demand guarantees of safety and maintenance. In an August letter to state rail infrastructure operator Adif, which was seen by Reuters, SEMAF had warned of severe wear and tear on several lines, including the stretch where the two trains crashed on Sunday. \"It is a vicious circle. If there are defects in the track, they are transmitted to the train, and defects in the train are also transmitted to the track,\" Diego Martin, the union's general secretary, told Reuters. Reports of problems show sharp increase Problems such as deterioration and breaks in the rails increased from 440 in 2015 to 716 in 2024, according to official data. Accidents, including derailments, also rose in the same period to 57 from 42. The government said that infrastructure issues and accidents on the Spanish network are proportionally below the EU's average and in line with countries such as Germany and France. The government also pointed to a significant increase in investment. Spending on railway infrastructure has tripled and maintenance per km has increased by 58% to 71,000 euros last year since 2018, when the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took office. But a 2024 annual report into Spanish infrastructure by Fundacion BBVA and Ivie showed that the investment was still well below levels before Spain's financial crisis that began in 2008, when adjusted for inflation. Gross investment in rail infrastructure in 2024 was less than a third of the roughly 11 billion euros at its 2009 peak, the report said. The decline since 2009 was so steep that starting in 2012 it was not enough to cover depreciation, namely keeping existing facilities in adequate condition, said Matilde Mas, an Ivie researcher who worked on the report. Investment only returned to a steady rate of increase in 2021. Like a Ferrari, Spain's world-class rail system needs regular upkeep, said Garcia-Ayllon. \"The expensive thing about a Ferrari is not just buying it, it's maintaining it,\" he said.

{"title": "SpaceX in merger talks with other Musk companies ahead of IPO", "body": "SpaceX is exploring deals with other companies helmed by serial entrepreneur Elon Musk, leaving investors working through permutations between space, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence to analyse which combination makes the most sense. The rocket maker is in discussions to merge with xAI ahead of a blockbuster public offering ​planned for this year, Reuters reported on Thursday (29 January). The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, X social media platform and Grok chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and ‌two regulatory filings. Reuters could not determine the deal's value, timing or primary rationale. SpaceX is also considering a merger with Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla, Bloomberg reported. \"I think it's highly likely that (xAI) ends up with one of the two parties,\" said Tesla shareholder Gene Munster, who is managing partner at xAI investor Deepwater Asset Management. Musk, the world's richest man, is CEO of SpaceX and artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls X. He also runs Tesla, tunnel company The Boring Co and neurotechnology firm Neuralink. \"What's important for Elon is to have a massive vision that's way out there that he's early on,\" Munster said. A compelling prospect would be Tesla taking xAI, which would improve the EV maker's robot and self-driving car plans, he said. Predictions hub Polymarket late on Thursday put the chance of a SpaceX-xAI merger by mid-year at ‌48% and a Tesla-xAI merger at 16%. Musk, SpaceX, xAI and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla's share price rose 3% in after-hours trade. SpaceX plans to go public some time ​this year with a valuation likely above $1 trillion, Reuters and other media reported. It is the world's most-valuable privately held company, at $800 billion in a recent private share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, the Wall Street Journal reported. Tesla's market capitalisation is $1.4 trillion. For SpaceX, a massive deal may complicate its IPO but add momentum to efforts to launch data centres into orbit, a key goal in the escalating AI race against the likes of OpenAI, Meta Platforms and Alphabet's Google. Some Tesla shareholders ‍have long advocated bringing Musk's companies together. Bloomberg reported that investors have been pushing the idea of joining SpaceX and Tesla. \"Musk has too many separate companies,\" said Dennis Dick, chief market strategist at Stock Trader Network. \"A major risk thesis for Tesla is that Musk is spreading himself out too much. As a Tesla shareholder, I applaud further consolidation.\" Under a SpaceX-xAI merger, xAI shares would be exchanged for SpaceX shares. Two entities have been established in Nevada to facilitate, said the person briefed on the matter, requesting anonymity because discussions are confidential. Filings showed those entities were set up on ⁠21 January but did not detail their purpose or role in any deal. One lists SpaceX and its chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, as managing members. The other lists Johnsen as sole officer. Johnsen did not respond to a request for comment. Some xAI ‍executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal, said the person briefed on the matter. No final agreement has been signed and the deal timing and structure remain fluid, the person said. Data centres in space Space-based AI processing, ‌powered by solar ‌energy, is aimed at cutting the cost of generating the computing power that runs and trains AI models such as xAI's Grok. Billionaire Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has announced a high-capacity backbone network of thousands of satellites, while Google is researching space-based data centres under Project Suncatcher. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Musk - whose timing projections are rarely realised – said, \"The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.\" Building data centres in space is a risky proposition, considering AI is evolving rapidly and unpredictably. Analysts and executives have questioned whether envisioned cuts in energy consumption are worth the cost of tailoring systems for space. Folding in xAI could also boost SpaceX's prospects for contracts at the Pentagon, which ⁠has sought to ramp up AI adoption in military networks, said ⁠Caleb Henry of space research and advisory Quilty Analytics. US ​Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this month visited SpaceX's Starbase development site in Texas, where he said xAI's language model and chat platform Grok will be integrated into military networks as part of an \"AI acceleration strategy\" aimed at speeding up military decision-making and planning. xAI has a contract worth as much as $200 million to provide Grok products to the Pentagon. Through xAI, Musk is building out a supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Starlink and national security variant Starshield already rely heavily on AI, such as for automated satellite manoeuvres in orbit. Starshield, under a ‍contract with a US intelligence agency, is building a network of hundreds of classified satellites equipped with sensors that are widely expected to use AI to help track moving targets on Earth. Latest merger between Musk companies Musk already has been combining businesses. In 2016, he used Tesla stock to buy solar-energy company SolarCity. Last year, he folded X into xAI in a share swap that gave the AI startup access to the microblog's data and distribution. xAI also received a $2 billion investment commitment from SpaceX as part of a $5 billion equity fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported last year. This month, xAI raised $20 billion in an ​upsized Series E funding round, exceeding its $15 billion target at a valuation of $230 billion. It also gained a commitment of about $2 billion from Tesla on Wednesday. Ross ‍Gerber, CEO of Tesla and xAI investor Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said he could envision a marriage of Musk's businesses. \"It's like a bunch of overvalued companies merging together into one big overvalued mess run by Elon. But it's a pure play now. It's like, you want to invest in Elon? Here ​you go. Like, you get all this. And it's much more attractive, actually, as an investment.\" Elon Musk / spacex / X / Starlink / Grok", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/spacex-merger-talks-other-musk-companies-ahead-ipo-1347846", "date": "2026-01-30T11:50:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 30 January, 2026, 11:50 am Last modified: 30 January, 2026, 11:54 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 1031, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:25:21.736972"}

This comes even as shipments to some traditional markets showed slight growth. Data from the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) show that from July to November of the fiscal 2025-26, garment exports to non-traditional markets dropped by 3.39% compared with the same period a year earlier. The fall has been steeper in several of the larger non-traditional destinations, such as Australia, India, South Korea, Russia, Turkey and Mexico, according to data. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Industry insiders say the slowdown in global consumer demand, weak marketing efforts by both the government and the private sector, a lack of product diversification in line with market demand, and reduced government incentives for exports to these markets have all contributed to the decline. RMG exporters support relaxed FOC rules, local suppliers raise investment and value addition concerns Around 16% of Bangladesh's total garment exports go to non-traditional markets, which include about 15 major countries outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the 27-member European Union. These markets have long been seen as crucial for reducing reliance on traditional destinations. Sharp drops in key destinations An analysis of EPB data suggests that while garment exports to traditional markets are also facing pressure, the rate of decline has been higher in non-traditional markets. Exports to India fell by more than 8% during the five-month period. Bangladesh shipped garments worth $298m to India between July and November, $26m less than in the same period of the previous financial year. Australia, the largest non-traditional export destination for Bangladesh garments, saw exports drop by 10% year-on-year to $313m during the period. Exports also fell sharply in other non-traditional markets, declining by 12% in South Korea, 16% in Mexico, 25% in Turkey and 23% in Russia.

The situation is worse in non-traditional markets mainly because of weak marketing, a lack of continuous communication and follow-up, and reduced incentives.\" He said Bangladesh has been unable to match China's aggressive marketing strategies in markets such as South Korea and Japan. He also criticised the performance of commercial wings at Bangladeshi missions abroad, saying they have not met expectations. \"There was once a 5% cash incentive to encourage exports to new markets, which has now been reduced to just 2%. This has discouraged exporters and is one of the reasons behind the decline,\" he added. Bangladesh must align with EU Green Deal by 2030 to safeguard RMG exports: Experts Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel echoed similar concerns, saying Bangladesh's failure to develop products in line with market demand and its weak marketing efforts remain key challenges. Mixed picture in traditional markets EPB data show a mixed trend in traditional markets. Garment exports to the United States, Bangladesh's single largest destination, rose by 3% in the July-November period to $3.22 billion, up from $3.13 billion a year earlier. Exports also increased by 6.51% to Canada and by 3% to the United Kingdom. Within the European Union, exports grew to Spain, Poland and the Netherlands.

However, shipments declined to Germany – the second-largest single-country destination for Bangladeshi garments – as well as to France, Denmark and Italy. Around 16% of Bangladesh's total garment exports go to non-traditional markets, which include about 15 major countries outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and the 27-member European Union. These markets have long been seen as crucial for reducing reliance on traditional destinations. Sharp drops in key destinations An analysis of EPB data suggests that while garment exports to traditional markets are also facing pressure, the rate of decline has been higher in non-traditional markets. Exports to India fell by more than 8% during the five-month period. Bangladesh shipped garments worth $298m to India between July and November, $26m less than in the same period of the previous financial year. Australia, the largest non-traditional export destination for Bangladesh garments, saw exports drop by 10% year-on-year to $313m during the period. Exports also fell sharply in other non-traditional markets, declining by 12% in South Korea, 16% in Mexico, 25% in Turkey and 23% in Russia. However, garment exports increased in some newer or non-traditional markets, including Brazil, China, Japan, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa. China sharply losing US apparel market; Bangladesh, Vietnam and India major gainers: Report Shehab Udduza Chowdhury, vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), told The Business Standard, \"Overall, our export performance is not good.

He also criticised the performance of commercial wings at Bangladeshi missions abroad, saying they have not met expectations. \"There was once a 5% cash incentive to encourage exports to new markets, which has now been reduced to just 2%.

{"title": "Man City's unbeaten home streak ends with 2-0 loss to Leverkusen", "body": "Manchester City suffered a rare Champions League defeat at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday as Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen claimed a stunning 2-0 victory to end the hosts' 23-game unbeaten home run in the competition's group or league stage. The loss spoiled Pep Guardiola's 100th Champions League match as City manager and left the Premier League side provisionally sixth on 10 points after five games. Alejandro Grimaldo and Patrik Schick scored for Leverkusen, who are 13th. Guardiola rested most of his regular starters for the first half with 10 changes to his team and the risky move backfired. LEVERKUSEN OPEN SCORING WITH COUNTER-ATTACK STRIKE Leverkusen struck in the 23rd minute on the counter-attack when Malik Tillman sent in a cross that Christian Kofane held up in the penalty area for Grimaldo to fire home. Guardiola sent on reinforcements to start the second half in Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku and Nico O'Reilly, but it did not stop the visitors doubling their lead in the 54th minute with a glancing Schick header over a lunging Nathan Ake and past the outstretchedhands of goalkeeper James Trafford. City's scoring machine Erling Haaland entered the game in the 65th minute to a standing ovation. But while he was in the thick of the action, there were no late-game heroics with Mark Flekken making a brave stop from the big Norwegian's best chance, a one-on-one with the keeper after running onto a through ball from Foden. \"I take full responsibility, still I think the players that started were exceptional players but we missed something needed at the highest level. We now have to fight for the next games,\" Guardiola said. \"I have to accept it. If we win it (changes) wouldn't be a problem, so I have to accept it that maybe it's a lot, but I think playing every two or three days we need to (make changes) but seeing the result, maybe it's too much.\" LEVERKUSEN KEEPER FLEKKEN PRODUCES BRILLIANT SAVES City had been keen to make amends for their 2-1 Premier League loss at Newcastle United on Saturday, but it was not to be and Flekken was a big reason why. The Dutchman also made brilliant saves to deny Ake and Tijjani Reijnders as City peppered the visitors' goal with 20 attempts, including seven on target to Leverkusen's two. \"It's an unbelievable feeling (to win at The Etihad) to be honest,\" Leverkusen defender Jarell Quansah told TNT Sports. \"We needed a lot of character and a lot of fight and grit. \"We know they've got a lot of world-class quality and even the players that started tonight we know they're world-class players playing for their countries as well, so it was always going to be a tough task when they came on. We defended a bit deeper than I would have liked to but glad to get the win.\" Leverkusen boss Kasper Hjulmand called it a night to remember. \"We are so happy with this win, but not only the win but the character the team showed,\" he said. \"I have great respect for the players, for the team we are. We are building a team here, and I think this night is a night to remember, and it's fuel to our development. \"Of course we had moments where we needed a little bit of luck and a very good keeper tonight.\" City had not lost at home in the Champions League group stage since a shock 2-1 defeat by Lyon in September 2018.

As part of its strategy to intervene in the foreign exchange market, Bangladesh Bank began buying dollars through auctions in July this year. Under the market-based exchange rate system, the central bank's goal is to maintain balance in the foreign exchange market, allowing the dollar price to fall when supply exceeds demand, and permitting prices to rise when demand increases. Bankers say there are several reasons for the recent decline in dollar demand. With the government's large foreign payment obligations falling, demand for foreign currency has decreased.

{"title": "Trump says hiking tariffs on South Korean goods to 25%", "body": "US President Donald Trump said Monday that he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods including autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals, accusing the country of not living up to an earlier trade pact struck with Washington. The increase would bring tariff levels from 15% to 25%. \"South Korea's Legislature is not living up to its Deal with the United States,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. He added that he was increasing tariff rates \"because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative.\" South Korea's presidential office said it had not been informed about the tariff hike plans in advance. It said Trade Minister Kim Jung-kwan, currently in Canada, would head to Washington for talks on the issue with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Trump's apparent about-face comes months after Washington and Seoul struck a trade and security deal, capping a period of tense negotiations. The agreement was finalized after Trump met his South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung in October, and included investment promises by South Korea alongside tariff cuts by the United States. Since then it remained in something of a legal limbo in South Korea. Seoul's presidential office insisted in November the deal does not require parliamentary approval, arguing it represents a memorandum of understanding rather than a binding legal document. Asked whether the tariff deal had been submitted to parliament for approval, a senior official told AFP on Tuesday they were looking into it but did not elaborate. Under the pact, Washington would maintain levies of up to 15% on South Korean goods including vehicles, car parts and pharmaceuticals. Crucially, the deal's terms brought US tariffs on South Korean cars down from a 25% level. Trump's latest threat, if enacted, would reverse that. The auto industry accounts for 27% of South Korea's exports to the United States, which takes in nearly half of the country's car exports. A reversal to a higher tariff level could also put South Korean exports in a less advantageous position compared with economies like Japan and the European Union, which have both struck deals for a 15% US tariff. The Trump administration has yet to issue formal notices to enact the changes. The US president's threat targeting South Korea is his latest against key trading partners in recent days. Over the weekend, Trump warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China, he would impose a 100% tariff on all goods coming across the border. Earlier in January, Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on multiple European nations until his purchase of Greenland is achieved. He has since backed off the threat.

{"title": "'Keep dreaming': NATO chief says Europe can't defend itself without US", "body": "NATO chief Mark Rutte warned yesterday (26 January) Europe cannot defend itself without the United States, in the face of calls for the continent to stand on its own feet after tensions over Greenland. US President Donald Trump roiled the transatlantic alliance by threatening to seize the autonomous Danish territory -- before backing off after talks with Rutte last week. The diplomatic crisis gave fresh momentum to those advocating for Europe to take a tougher line against Trump and break its military reliance on Washington. \"If anyone thinks here again that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US -- keep on dreaming. You can't,\" Rutte told lawmakers at the European Parliament. He said that EU countries would have to double defence spending from the five percent NATO target agreed last year to 10 percent and spend \"billions and billions\" on building nuclear arms. \"You would lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the US nuclear umbrella,\" the former Dutch prime minister said. \"So hey, good luck.\" France's foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot hit back at the NATO chief's statements, posting on X on Monday evening that \"Europeans can and must take responsibility for their own security\". Rutte insisted that US commitment to NATO's Article Five mutual defence clause remained \"total\", but that the United States expected European countries to keep spending more on their militaries. \"They need a secure Euro-Atlantic, and they also need a secure Europe. So, the US has every interest in NATO,\" he said. The NATO head reiterated his repeated praise for Trump for pressuring reluctant European allies to step up defence spending. He also appeared to knock back a suggestion floated by the EU's defence commissioner Andrius Kubilius earlier this month for a possible European defence force that could replace US troops on the continent. \"It will make things more complicated. I think (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will love it. So, think again,\" Rutte said. On Greenland, Rutte said he had agreed with Trump that NATO would \"take more responsibility for the defence of the Arctic\", but it was up to Greenlandic and Danish authorities to negotiate over US presence on the island. \"I have no mandate to negotiate on behalf of Denmark, so I didn't, and I will not,\" he said. Rutte reiterated that he had stressed to Trump the cost paid by NATO allies in Afghanistan after the US leader caused outrage by playing down their contribution. \"For every two American soldiers who paid the ultimate price, one soldier of an ally or a partner, a NATO ally or a partner country, did not return home,\" he said. \"I know that America greatly appreciates all the efforts.\" NATO / Mark Rutte", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/keep-dreaming-nato-chief-says-europe-cant-defend-itself-without-us-1344971", "date": "2026-01-27T12:25:00+06:00", "author": "BSS/AFP 27 January, 2026, 12:25 pm Last modified: 27 January, 2026, 02:22 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 455, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:25:39.893296"}

During this period, 14,002 samples were tested and 3,533 were found positive for Covid-19. Nasima Sultana, additional director general of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) disclosed this during an online briefing on Wednesday. The previous high of 24.95 percent was recorded two days ago. The overall infection rate in the country currently stands at 19.75 percent. The infection rate had been fluctuating between 20 percent and 23 percent since June. In the second week of this month, the infection rate increased to 24 percent. Although there has been a slight drop in the number of tests since the beginning of this month, following the imposition of test fees, the infection rate has been rising. Professor Nazrul Islam, a noted virologist and former vice-chancellor of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, told The Business Standard that infections are on the rise because there is no lockdown, no identification of patients and no isolation. \"Patients are being identified in fewer numbers because the number of tests is low. Rising infection rates mean the number of patients is also increasing, but many of them are undiagnosed,\" he argued. \"If we collect 20 samples from each upazila of the country and if more samples are collected from hotspot areas in Dhaka and Chattogram, the number of tests will be around 20,000 per day. A somewhat accurate idea about the Covid-19 infection rate in the country could be found if 20,000 tests were done every day,\" maintained Nazrul Islam, also a member of the National Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19. Meanwhile, 33 more people died of Covid-19 in the country in the last 24 hours. The death toll now stands at 2,457 and the current death rate is 1.27 percent. \"Of the dead patients on Wednesday, 27 are men and six are women.

The device will cost much less than similar devices from foreign countries since the technology is homegrown, and there will be guarantee for repairs for many years of use, he furthered. Rabbani said, \"It has already been demonstrated at BSMMU and doctors there opined that this device is very essential and timely. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of BSMMU has also approved a research project for using this device in the Intensive Care department.\" \"The vice chancellor of BSMMU, Professor Kanak Kanti Barua, has already allocated partial funds for this research,\" he informed. The team comprises as many as eight members from the researchers of DU's Biomedical Physics and Technology Department, Rakib Sakhawat Hossen, lecturer of the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Asia Pacific University, Moniruzzaman, researcher of Bi-BEAT Limited and Muhammad Abdul Kadir, chairman of the concerned DU department. Moreover, the team has taken suggestions on the medical aspects from Professor AKM Akhtaruzzaman, head of Anaesthesia, Analgesia and Intensive Care Medicine Department of BSMMU. Vice Chancellor of DU Dr Md Akhtaruzzaman has been providing encouragement and support since the beginning of this project and gave special permission to the researchers to work at the department during the lockdown at Dhaka University, Rabbani said. Private-run pharmaceutical company, Beximco Pharma partially funded and the DU researchers who are funded from Sweden's Uppsala University under the International Science Programme used own funds to support this project. Under the overall supervision of the Biomedical Physics and Technology Department of DU, BiBEAT Limited, a non-profit and non-shareholding social enterprise, is ready to supply such units to any hospital in the country. BiBEAT Limited is an authorised organization to commercialize the product they invent, as per a memorandum of understanding with the Biomedical Physics and Technology Department of DU.

{"title": "FBI searches Atlanta election office, chasing Trump 2020 vote fraud claims", "body": "The FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County outside Atlanta yesterday, pursuing US President Donald Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud. The FBI said in a brief statement that its agents executed a warrant at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, a large, warehouse-like facility opened by Georgia officials in 2023, and called it a \"court-authorized law enforcement activity.\" The search concluded last night, a law enforcement official said. The warrant \"sought a number of records related to 2020 elections,\" the Fulton County government said in a brief statement about the search, the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly. The FBI agents were looking to seize computers and ballots they believed were held at the facility as part of an investigation into possible election interference, a law enforcement official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Joe Biden, a Democrat, won Georgia and defeated Trump, a Republican who was seeking reelection in 2020. Trump returned to the presidency for a second term last year after winning the 2024 election. 'TRYING TO CREATE CHAOS' Fulton County Commissioner Mo Ivory confirmed a warrant was being served and said federal officials were collecting 700 boxes of ballots from a secure location. In a video posted to social media made from inside the election center, she accused Trump of \"trying to create chaos\" in order to benefit Republicans in November. In separate comments to reporters, Ivory called the federal intrusion \"an assault on voters\" and said local officials were considering what legal recourse they might have to stop it. \"We know in America right now, it does not even matter if what you are saying is the right thing. If our president wants to bring in the forces, he will,\" Ivory told reporters. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard visited the site of the search yesterday, as Reuters witnessed, giving her a highly unusual presence in domestic law enforcement that one former official called unprecedented. Reuters reported that Gabbard last year formed a group of dozens of officials from across the federal government, including the Justice Department, that was helping to steer Trump's drive for retribution against his perceived enemies. \"She is once again demonstrating her utter lack of fitness for office that she holds by injecting the non-partisan intelligence community she is supposed to be leading into a domestic political stunt,\" said Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee. \"She is totally unqualified to hold a position that demands sound judgment, apolitical independence, and a singular focus on keeping Americans safe.\" The search was conducted a week after Trump reiterated during comments in Davos, Switzerland, his longstanding and debunked claim that the 2020 voting \"was a rigged election.\" \"People will soon be prosecuted for what they did,\" Trump said in Davos. The Trump administration separately began a lawsuit last month to get hold of Fulton County's 2020 ballots. In the suit, the administration said that the ballots and other records being sought were in the custody of the Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta. The administration has asked a federal judge to order Che Alexander, Fulton County's court clerk, to hand over \"physical ballots, stubs, and absentee ballot envelopes for the 2020 General Election.\" Alexander this month asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, noting that the ballots she holds are under seal under state law, and that the administration should instead ask the county Superior Court for an order to unseal them. Alexander did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Democratic-leaning Fulton County is home to Atlanta, Georgia's biggest city, and backed Biden by a wide margin in the 2020 election. PRESSURE FROM TRUMP Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn the 2020 election result, pressuring Georgia's top election official to \"find\" votes that would allow him to claim victory. Several reviews and a hand audit of ballots confirmed that Biden narrowly won the state. Trump this month asked a Georgia state court for $6.2 million in legal fees, saying he spent fighting criminal charges of election interference filed by Fulton County's chief prosecutor, District Attorney Fani Willis. The prosecution of Trump by Willis for alleged racketeering foundered after revelations that she had a romantic relationship with one of the lawyers she hired, and the case was dismissed last year. Under Trump, the Justice Department has also sued several states besides Georgia, demanding that they turn over large volumes of voter data. States have challenged the demands as an unconstitutional infringement on their authority to manage elections. A few judges have tossed out the lawsuits, most recently this week in Oregon. A succession of people who have criticised Trump or resisted his agenda have found themselves investigated by the Justice Department, led by Trump appointee Pam Bondi, in the past year. The department unsuccessfully tried to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York state Attorney General Letitia James, who both led previous investigations into Trump.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/fbi-searches-atlanta-election-office-chasing-trump-2020-vote-fraud-claims-1346931", "date": "2026-01-29T12:15:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 29 January, 2026, 12:15 pm Last modified: 29 January, 2026, 12:30 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 858, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:25:55.005964"}
{"title": "What's wrong with Argentina?", "body": "Even in 2016, Argentina were one of the best teams in the World. Three years from then, here we are, people don’t even bet on them to beat Venezuela. The question of what is wrong with the team is obvious, and another question that rises is if they can recover from this to their prime. The questions are complicated and so are the answers, but the answers are what every Argentina fan around the globe is looking for. Let’s start with the second question. Can they return to their former place? The answer has to be yes. The team is full of talented players, and as a footballing nation, Argentina have continuously produced world class talents. Just look at the names - Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Angel Di Maria - all have dominated Europe, and the first one the list, has been one of the greatest ever to play the game. Even their youngsters like Lautaro Martinez, Nicolas Tagliafico, Leandro Paredes, Giovanni Lo Celso - are lauded as World Class talents and future world beaters. But they have not managed to put up a team, because the 11 players they line up on the field don’t really look like they are a team. And now comes the question, why? Why aren’t they the team they were anymore? The reasons are not few in number, and let’s explore them. Argentina’s downfall started after their defeat to Chile in 2016, in the Copa America Centenario final. Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and Sergio Aguero announced their retirement from international football and coach Gerardo Martino resigned, it was a massive blow for the Argentina Football Association (AFA). Albeit they returned from their retirement in a short span, but the blow sent AFA into madness. The manager they introduced next was Eduardo Bauza, and that is where the trouble began. Bauza, the veteran coach, wasn’t someone even near capable to coach a team of Argentina’s stature. His mediocre mentality reflected on the team, and they started showing lacklustre performances. It was like Maradona all over, just instead of putting players in the wrong positions, Bauza kept on selecting mediocre players in his team. The whole burden was on Lionel Messi, and as it has happened over the years, the pressure was too much for the little magician. After a calamity in Bauza, the Argentine board brought in Jorge Sampaoli, a fan favorite and the man behind Chile’s triumph against Argentina in the 2015 Copa America final. But the desired change in the managerial role didn’t bring any significant changes to the team as they still looked unsettled. They were poor in their qualifiers for the Russia World Cup and they almost did not qualify, just for an incredible Lionel Messi hattrick against Ecuador on their final game to take them through. The matches leading to the World Cup didn’t show much promise as they were thrashed 6-1 by Spain at Madrid in a friendly match. They started their World Cup campaign with a draw against Iceland as their captain Messi’s penalty was saved by the goalkeeper. Their next match against Croatia was a horror show as the Croats went on to beat them 3-0. They had to win against Nigeria to qualify for the knockout stage, and they did with Marcos Rojo clinched the winner on 86th minute. Argentina were through, but their match in the Round of 16 was against France, who later went on to win the whole thing. Argentina lost the match 4-3 after a valiant effort, but a defeat was a defeat, and that meant they were out of the tournament. Sampaoli’s decision making was questionable throughout the tournament, as his team selection looked clueless. The team weren’t playing football of any quality, and it was pretty obvious that he wouldn’t stay at the helm after all of these. He didn’t, and his protege Lionel Scaloni was appointed as the interim manager. Scaloni did a better job than his predecessors with stars like Messi taking a rest from the national side, youngsters fared pretty well under him but there was never any constant threat from the former defender’s side. Even after Messi and other stars returned, his team was defensive and played to not concede rather than score. His defensive approach to the game has been condemned, but he hasn’t changed. And this Copa America has showed exactly what’s wrong with playing at first gear. Look at this Argentina side. They don’t have a Javier Mascherano to clean up, and that has probably led Scaloni to play a tad defensive. But he must remember, no Mascherano means if he lets the opposition attack, there’s nobody to take the ball away from them or to make pinpoint tackles to stop them. This Argentine side have midfielders who blossom playing attacking football, every time these players were tried in a defensive position or tactics, they blundered. Giovanni Lo Celso was used as a pivot at PSG and he was often the weakest link in the team. But once he got the opportunity to play in a more attacking role at Real Betis, he flourished. No wonder the Albiceleste midfield has found it tough to control the games, and yes, it’s not only because the pitches of Brazil are scrappy. Lionel Messi might be the greatest of his generation, but he can’t save them this time. After all he’s just human, and you can not hide a huge mountain of problems behind a man who is known for crumbling under pressure. The more weight you put on the little genius, the more will his spine crack and the less we’ll be able to devour his brilliance. Argentina have a lot of problems and they need to solve them fast. They will face Brazil in the semifinals, and they are going to the match as clear underdogs. That states Argentina’s fall from grace, they can’t even stand face-to-face with their arch rivals. They have been thrown out of Olympus for their own fault, and they need to find a way to redeem themselves. Or else, they’ll just have to drop to hell, and they’ll have to be mere humans who will try to fight the giants from Jotunheim and fail.

{"title": "Unlabelled AI-generated videos spread in election campaigns, reports Dismislab", "body": "Unlabelled AI-generated videos are circulating widely on social media as part of election campaigning in Bangladesh, raising concerns over platform enforcement and voter awareness, according to independent fact-checking platform Dismislab. In one Facebook video posted on 4 January, an elderly man is shown in a busy marketplace saying he will vote for the Sheaf of Paddy, the electoral symbol of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), citing promises of family, agriculture and health cards. In another video posted a day later, a woman standing in a rural setting praises the Scales, the electoral symbol of Jamaat-e-Islami, describing it as a symbol of justice and fairness. According to Dismislab, closer inspection reveals inconsistencies in both videos. Each clip contains frequent scene cuts, with a new scene appearing roughly every eight seconds. Dismislab reports that both videos are AI-generated and are being circulated on social media as part of political campaigning ahead of the 13th National Parliamentary Election scheduled for 12 February. While the use of AI in political campaigns is not prohibited, none of the videos contain an AI label, which violates Meta's transparency policy. Between 1 and 15 January, Dismislab documented more than 800 AI-generated videos related to election campaigns across Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, including duplicate counts. It found that 60% of AI-related content on Facebook carried no AI disclaimer. The situation was similar on other platforms. Of the 21 Facebook pages identified, seven posted the same videos on YouTube and two on TikTok. A review of 181 videos from the seven YouTube channels showed that 94.48% had no AI label. None of the 50 videos posted on TikTok contained an AI disclaimer, according to Dismislab. On Facebook, where 576 AI-generated videos were posted from 21 pages, Dismislab found that the \"AI info\" disclaimer is visible only on the primary Facebook app. When the same videos are viewed on Facebook Lite or on a computer, the label does not appear. Dismislab noted that in Bangladesh, where digital literacy remains low, many users mistake AI-generated content for authentic information. It also reported that the Bangladesh Election Commission has expressed concerns over the spread of AI content on at least two occasions, first on 12 December and again on 20 January, two days before official electioneering began. Dismislab said its findings, alongside global studies, show that AI-generated content can influence voter opinions and create an uneven electoral environment, particularly when such material is circulated without disclosure. Experts cited by Dismislab warned that voters are particularly vulnerable to AI-generated content because many tend to trust information that aligns with their existing political beliefs. During elections, this tendency intensifies, increasing the likelihood that such content will be accepted and shared without verification, especially when it involves negative claims about political opponents. According to Dismislab, the AI-generated videos feature a wide range of fabricated characters, including supposed police officers, political figures and ordinary citizens, who appear to endorse parties and promote favourable narratives. The analysis found that content supporting Jamaat-e-Islami often used false endorsements by \"official figures\" and common people, while several BNP-linked videos used AI-generated children to seek votes. Both sides were also found to be using AI-generated videos to discredit opponents. Content favouring Jamaat frequently portrayed the BNP as extortionists or deceptive, while counter-campaigns targeting Jamaat used similar tactics to depict the party as \"anti-state\", Dismislab reported.

{"title": "Western safeguards, Chinese momentum: Bangladesh’s search for balance and resilience in development financing", "body": "Bangladesh stands today at a defining crossroads in its development journey. Having already crossed the threshold of a lower-middle-income country, it now aspires to become a middle-income economy within the coming decade. But that ambition requires massive investment — billions of dollars in infrastructure, energy security and digital transformation. According to the World Bank, Bangladesh will need an additional $22 billion in investment each year by 2026 if it is to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such staggering sums are well beyond the reach of domestic resources alone. Inevitably, dependence on external finance has become not just a supplement but a lifeline. This dependence has placed Bangladesh squarely between two global camps of creditors — powerful, but strikingly different in character. On one side stand the traditional Western-led institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and bilateral partners like Japan and the US. On the other is China, the rising giant of the Global South, advancing its strategic and commercial interests under the vast umbrella of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The philosophies, conditions and strategies of these two camps diverge fundamentally — and the way Bangladesh navigates them will shape the nation's economic and political destiny. Western loans: Reform with strings The Western model of lending is anchored in governance, reform and institutional strengthening. Loans and grants from the World Bank, IMF, ADB or bilateral partners typically arrive tied to strict conditions: reducing subsidies, reforming state-owned enterprises, restructuring financial institutions, and promoting transparency and democratic accountability. In many ways, this is an extension of Western \"soft power\". There are undeniable advantages. Western funding has supported transformative projects in Bangladesh: the metro rail in Dhaka, the Matarbari deep-sea port, and countless social-sector initiatives. Moreover, stringent safeguards on environment and social protection have helped shield vulnerable communities from the worst excesses of rapid development. But there is a darker side. The \"one-size-fits-all\" prescriptions of Washington or Tokyo often overlook local realities. In Sri Lanka, Ghana and Zambia, austerity conditions attached to IMF packages strained ordinary citizens, sparking social unrest. Bangladesh too, is not immune. The recent IMF loan tied to the withdrawal of fuel subsidies and reform of the banking sector has unleashed fresh economic pressures. Yet here lies the deeper truth: Bangladesh's banking sector was not crippled by bad luck but gutted by years of political capture, collusion, and what can only be called economic cannibalism. Reforms in this sector are not merely technical fixes; they represent a test of whether Bangladesh can uproot a culture of impunity that corrodes governance at every level. Western loans, therefore, do not just move money — they pry open the cracks in national policy and expose the moral bankruptcy of vested interests. Chinese loans: Speed and shadows China's approach could not be more different. Often referred to as the \"Beijing Consensus\", it prides itself on non-interference. Beijing does not impose overt conditions about governance, human rights or policy alignment. What it offers instead is speed and flexibility. Where Western lenders deliberate for years, Chinese loans can materialise quickly — delivering visible results. Bangladesh has benefited from this. Chinese finance has underpinned the Padma Bridge rail link, the Karnaphuli underwater tunnel and several power plants. These projects, completed or advancing at a record pace, have reshaped the country's infrastructure landscape. For policymakers eager to show tangible progress, China's model is attractive. Yet speed has its price. Chinese loans often come bundled with conditions that lock in Chinese contractors, suppliers and materials. A large portion of the borrowed money, therefore, circulates back to China, raising questions about who truly benefits. Western loans can help build stronger institutions; Chinese loans can deliver faster infrastructure. Both are valuable, but neither is a substitute for integrity, accountability and sovereign discipline. Bangladesh must ensure that borrowing fuels liberation, not dependence; opportunity, not burden. Western loans can help build stronger institutions; Chinese loans can deliver faster infrastructure. Both are valuable, but neither is a substitute for integrity, accountability and sovereign discipline. Bangladesh must ensure that borrowing fuels liberation, not dependence; opportunity, not burden. Worse still, many of these contracts remain shrouded in secrecy, eroding transparency and public trust. The cautionary tales are sobering. Sri Lanka's Hambantota port had to be leased to China for 99 years after Colombo failed to service the debt. Zambia too, fell into a debt crisis exacerbated by opaque Chinese loans. Bangladesh has repeatedly assured its citizens it will not fall into a \"debt trap\". Still, with external borrowing rising faster than export earnings, the warning signs are there. The question is not whether Bangladesh intends to avoid such a trap, but whether it has the discipline and foresight to do so. Bangladesh's pragmatic balancing act So far, Bangladesh has pursued a pragmatic dual strategy — drawing on both Western and Chinese financing. Western institutions continue to anchor major projects such as the Matarbari port or metro rail, while China powers energy plants, tunnels and rail links. The country has reaped dividends from this mixed approach. But it has also imported risks from both sides. Western loans tie Bangladesh into a web of policy reforms that can strain the social contract. Chinese loans tie it into opaque deals that risk undermining sovereignty. Both camps, in their own way, press the country to confront uncomfortable questions about governance, accountability and long-term sustainability. What Bangladesh must do Bangladesh's path forward is clear in principle, but challenging in practice. Diversification is essential. Relying too heavily on either Washington or Beijing is dangerous. India, the Middle East and new multilateral platforms should all become part of a broader financing strategy. At the same time, domestic investment must be unleashed through stronger public-private partnerships. Every dollar raised locally is one less borrowed abroad. Transparency is non-negotiable. No contract—Chinese, Western or otherwise—should remain hidden from Parliament or the public. Sunlight deters corruption, strengthens accountability and restores public trust. Development cannot thrive in the shadows. Equally critical is local participation. Foreign loans should not simply finance foreign firms. If local workers, contractors and suppliers remain sidelined, the benefits of debt evaporate abroad. By ensuring local involvement, Bangladesh can turn external borrowing into a platform for skills transfer and domestic economic vitality. Above all, the country must focus on boosting exports. At present, nearly 85% of Bangladesh's export earnings come from garments — a dangerously narrow base. To sustain debt repayments and build resilience, the economy must diversify into information technology, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, shipbuilding and leather. Without such diversification, every downturn in the global garment market becomes a national vulnerability. Finally, Bangladesh's institutions must rise to the challenge. The Economic Relations Division and the Ministry of Finance must evaluate every loan for its long-term economic and political implications. Short-term gains must never be allowed to mortgage future stability. The real test of leadership is not securing a loan but ensuring that it strengthens sovereignty rather than undermines it. As things stand, Bangladesh's development journey resembles a turbulent river, fed by two competing currents — Western loans laden with conditions, and Chinese loans flowing with speed but carrying shadows. To harness both without capsizing, the nation needs a steady hand at the helm. That hand must be transparent, accountable and guided by foresight. The truth is simple but profound. Western loans can help build stronger institutions; Chinese loans can deliver faster infrastructure. Both are valuable, but neither is a substitute for integrity, accountability and sovereign discipline. Bangladesh must ensure that borrowing fuels liberation, not dependence; opportunity, not burden. At this historic juncture, the nation does not need blind attraction to Beijing or Washington — what it needs is a sovereign, calculated and honest development strategy. That, more than anything else, will be its greatest diplomatic and economic triumph. Dr Mohammad Omar Farooq is Professor and Head of the Department of Economics, United International University.

{"title": "Do not set up cattle markets in Dhaka, Ctg: Nat’l Committee", "body": "The National Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 spread has suggested that the government do not set up cattle markets in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur and Chattogram ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Adha. The committee said the virus spread is yet to come under control and expressed concern over free public movement in the four districts. The technical body – formed to advise the government on curbing coronavirus pandemic and on improving the quality of medical service at hospitals – put forward the suggestions at its 14th meeting on Friday. Recommending strict restrictions on free movement, the committee proposed that the government initiate digital marketplaces for sacrificial cattle trade. Besides, it noted that cattle markets at other places could be set up by following health safety guidelines properly. \"We are suggesting to slaughter sacrificial animals at designated places out of cities instead of at homes,\" said a press release of the committee jointly signed by committee chief Dr Mohammod Shahidullah and Meerjady Sabrina Flora. On top of this, the national committee experts advocated for setting up cattle markets on open ground where there are enough spaces to maintain social distancing. It also discouraged the elderly people from going to the markets; recommended keeping separate entry and exit routes for the trading spots and mandating face masks for all at the markets. To increase the number of tests and its quality, the committee thinks that more attention should be given to the capacity building of testing facilities rather than to increasing the number of labs. Moreover, speeding up Covid-19 testing processes was also recommended. The committee suggested that the Directorate General of Drug Administration approve antigen-based testing so that remote areas could be brought under coronavirus detection. The committee recommended collecting RT-PCR kits from multiple sources to avert any supply crunch. Besides, it advocated for collecting effective and low-cost testing kits. The committee called for easing sample collection of the older people, and collecting their samples from home if possible. Suggestions were made to ease sufferings over access to public healthcare and to ensure medical facilities for all. The health directorate was suggested to update information about the number of available beds on the website regularly. Hospitals also could have displayed the number of available beds at their entrances, said the committee, emphasising introducing an inter-hospital network so that patients' rush can be equally squared on the government facilities. The committee also advised that transparency and quality be maintained in medical equipment purchase. The committee welcomed the ongoing research on vaccine discovery carried out by a private company. \"But the process must have due approvals from the government, Bangladesh Medical Research Council and Directorate General of Drug Administration before going for production,\" the committee noted.

De Granhomme became Malinga’s third scalp in as many deliveries as he went for a heave but missed the line of the delivery and it crashed into his stumps. Ross Taylor was adjudged LBW as a brute of a yorker trapped him in front of the wicket to complete Malinga’s stunning quadruple. Due to Malinga’s heroics, Sri Lanka won the match by 37 runs.

{"title": "Sylhet’s Keane Bridge could become country’s longest footbridge", "body": "The age-old Keane Bridge in Sylhet has been made off-limits to vehicles, taking into consideration its fragile structure. On September 1, Sylhet City Corporation (SCC) imposed a ban on plying of all modes of vehicles over the bridge, with immediate effect. As the bridge grew old and risky, the authorities concerned disbanded plying of heavy vehicles on the bridge in 2010. But the lighter ones, such as rickshaws, cycles and motorcycles were allowed to use the bridge. With the recent decision, no vehicles will be allowed to ply the bridge. SCC installed iron structures on both sides of the bridge on September 1, barring all the vehicles from using the bridge. The bridge - whose longevity locals think has long expired - is being renovated now. Though the city corporation is now saying that they have barred vehicular movement for carrying out renovation work, sources in the SCC have said they are planning to stop vehicular movement on the bridge permanently to protect the historic structure from further decay. The city corporation is considering allowing residents to cross the bridge on foot only after the renovation. If the decision is implemented, the 1,150-foot bridge might turn into one of the longest footbridge. On September 3, US Ambassador to Bangladesh Earl R Miller, along with SCC Mayor Ariful Haque Chowdhury, visited the bridge and opined that the bridge should be made off-limits to all modes of vehicles to protect the heritage structure. The bridge -- otherwise known as the gateway to Sylhet city -- was built in 1936 on the Surma, and was named after Sir Michael Keane, who was the English governor of Assam from 1932 to 1937. It is made of iron and steel and looks like a bow. During the 1971 Liberation War, part of the bridge was blown away with dynamites by the Pakistan Army. It was repaired in 1977. SCC Chief Engineer Nur Azizur Rahman said, “Taking into consideration the age and condition of the bridge, we gave a proposal to Roads and Highways Department to turn the bridge into a footbridge. They have agreed to the proposal.” “After further inspection during renovation work, the decision on whether to make the bridge permanently off-limits to vehicles will be taken.” Echoing the chief engineer, SCC Mayor Ariful Haque said the Keane Bridge is a “symbol of Sylhet”, and therefore, it has to be protected from further decay. “I also want the bridge to be turned into a footbridge,” the mayor added.

{"title": "Hong Kong man accused of terrorism in first use of new China security law", "body": "A man carrying a \"Liberate Hong Kong\" sign as he drove a motorcycle into police at a protest against the territory's Chinese rulers became on Friday the first person charged with inciting separatism and terrorism under a new security law. Beijing imposed the legislation on the former British colony earlier this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track. Critics say the law - which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - is aimed at crushing dissent and a long-running campaign for greater democracy. Police say 23-year-old Tong Ying-kit rammed and injured some officers at an illegal protest on Wednesday. A video online showed a motorbike knocking over several officers on a narrow street before the driver falls over and is arrested. Tong, who was hospitalised after the incident, was charged less than 24 hours after the city government said the slogan he was carrying - \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" - connotes separatism or subversion under the new law. The rallying cry appears on placards, T-shirts, and post-it notes stuck to walls around Hong Kong. China's parliament adopted the security law after sometimes violent protests last year triggered by fears Beijing was stifling freedoms, guaranteed by a \"one country, two systems\" formula agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the law aims at a few \"troublemakers\" and not wider rights that underpin the city's role as a gateway for capital flows in and out of China. But international anxiety is growing after authorities arrested 10 people under the new law within 24 hours of it taking effect. The European Union (EU) has put Hong Kong high on its agenda while the United Nations' rights office expressed alarm over arrests. \"I'm Not Scared\" At another court, dozens gathered in solidarity with a man charged for stabbing a policeman in the arm during Wednesday's disturbances. They held up blank pieces of paper to show fears for free speech. \"I'm not scared. Come what may,\" said a 25-year-old protester who gave his name only as Wilson. On Wednesday's 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, police arrested about 370 people, with 10 cases involving violations of the new law. In a further ominous sign for activists, a Communist Party cadre prominent during a 2011 clampdown on land rights protesters in a south China village is to head a newly-empowered national security office in Hong Kong, official news agency Xinhua said. Zheng Yanxiong, 57, most recently served as secretary general of the Communist Party committee of Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong. Leaked footage during the 2011 dispute showed him berating villagers and calling foreign media \"rotten\". The new legislation gives the security office greater enforcement action and powers to take suspects onto the mainland, as well as granting privileges for agents, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot inspect their vehicles. Some activists have been keeping a low profile or leaving. Demosisto, a pro-democracy group led by Joshua Wong, disbanded hours after the legislation was passed, while prominent group member Nathan Law left the city. \"The protests in Hong Kong have been a window for the world to recognise that China is getting more and more authoritarian,\" Law told Reuters. Hong Kong's publicly-funded public broadcaster RTHK, which has felt the pressure of government scrutiny, appeared to take heed of the law, reproducing the slogan as \"L*******#HongKong\" in a comment on Twitter, to the scorn of some social media users. hong kong / national security laws / China / arrest", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/south-asia-china/hong-kong-man-accused-terrorism-first-use-new-china-security-law-101524", "date": "2020-07-04T09:15:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 04 July, 2020, 09:15 am Last modified: 04 July, 2020, 09:19 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 615, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:17.484395"}

Britain said it would grant leave for Hong Kong citizens with British National Overseas Status, and their dependent families, to live and work in Britain for five years, and later apply for citizenship. There are around 3 million Hong Kong citizens who hold, or are eligible to apply for, BNO passports. Britain's Foreign Minister Dominic Raab told parliament he had held conversations with other nations with close relationships with Hong Kong.

{"title": "Sonali Bank turns Tk5,949cr capital deficit into Tk83cr surplus", "body": "State-owned Sonali Bank PLC has successfully transformed its temporary capital shortfall into a surplus by combining stringent measures against defaulted loans with cautious lending and strengthened recovery efforts. Managing Director and CEO Md Shawkat Ali Khan told The Business Standard that the bank's biggest achievement in 2025 was reducing the capital gap to zero and generating a surplus. According to its audited accounts for 2024, the bank faced a capital deficit of Tk5,949 crore. Provisional figures for 2025 show that this deficit has been fully covered, leaving a capital surplus of Tk83 crore. The CEO expressed optimism that if the bank continues along planned lines, its capital buffer could rise to 12% in 2026 Provisional accounts as of 31 December 2025 show the bank with no provision shortfall and a small surplus of Tk6 crore, compared to a provision requirement of Tk23,008 crore and actual provisions of Tk23,014 crore. Operational profit in 2025 stood at Tk8,017 crore, up 40.79% from Tk5,694 crore in 2024. Shawkat Ali Khan credited the success to strict borrower selection and enhanced recovery efforts, noting that committees at various levels, including the head office, have played a key role in reducing non-performing loans (NPLs). The provisional NPL ratio now stands at 15.51%, the lowest among state-owned banks, down from 18.20% in 2024. Total NPLs have decreased from Tk18,058 crore to Tk16,250 crore, with Tk4,895 crore recovered last year, including Tk1,195 crore in cash, compared to Tk1,272 crore recovered in 2024, including Tk580 crore in cash. As of September, Sonali Bank's loan to the state-owned Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation stood at Tk6,925 crore. The bank requested bond issuance from the Finance Ministry against this loan, which has not yet been disbursed, requiring Tk300 crore in provisioning. Additionally, Sonali Bank has opened LCs worth $11.38 billion (Tk94,226 crore) for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant. While the standard LC commission is 40 paisa per Tk100, the government has capped it at 5 paisa for this project. As of now, the government owes the bank Tk1,500 crore in commission. Khan noted that receipt of these dues would further boost the bank's profits. Deposits grew by 9% in 2025 to Tk1.79 lakh crore, while loans and advances increased by 5.57% to Tk1.04 lakh crore. The CEO highlighted that no special schemes or targets were set for deposit growth; the increase reflects growing public confidence in the bank. Looking ahead to 2026, Sonali Bank plans to expand quality lending while reducing investment in government securities and focusing on commercial lending. Priority will be given to cottage, micro, small, and medium enterprises (CMSMEs). Loan recovery efforts will continue through borrower negotiation, interest waivers, and rescheduling, following the successful strategies of 2025. About Tk500 crore of loans were rescheduled last year under the guidance of the Policy Support Committee and with Bangladesh Bank approval, with down payments ranging from 1% to 2% depending on the case. Shawkat Ali Khan emphasised that the bank will remain vigilant to prevent future NPL growth and ensure no new \"Hallmark Group\" crises emerge.

Through this campaign, students will be taught about personal hygiene, classroom cleanliness and the need for clean water and sanitation. Students will also learn and practice proper hand washing methods. Md Shah Kamal, the chief commissioner of Bangladesh Scouts, Md Fossiullah, the national deputy commissioner of Bangladesh Scouts, Salma Siddiqui, acting principal of Azimpur Government Girls School and College, Salahuddin Ahmed Tareq, marketing manager of ‘Dettol Harpic Porichchonno Bangladesh' and Riaz, the ambassador of ‘Dettol Harpic Porichchonno Bangladesh' were also present on the occasion. cleanup campaign", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/students-take-oath-keep-surroundings-clean", "date": "2019-09-04T19:50:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 04 September, 2019, 07:50 pm Last modified: 04 September, 2019, 07:55 pm", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 168, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:26.044175"}
{"title": "Kuwait annuls paperwork processed by General regarding Papul graft scandal", "body": "All paperwork, signed and issued by the Assistant Under-Secretary of Kuwait's Ministry of Interior, Major General Sheikh Mazen Al Jarrah,pertaining to Bangladeshi labourers has been annuled. The decision was made in order to revise all transactions between 2014 to 2018, regarding citizenship and passports, as Al Jarrah was overseeing the department during that period reports Gulf News. Al Jarrah allegedly signed off on paperwork allowing thousands of Bangladeshis to obtain work permits, as part of the Bangladeshi MP Mohammed Shahid Islam's illegal dealings in Kuwait. The Ministry of Interior is reviewing all paperwork with Al Jarrah's signature to determine which transactions were connected to Islam. A source told Al Qabas that Al Jarrah also signed off on paperwork allowing Syrians to enter the country on visit visas, despite the fact that Syrians were barred from entering Kuwait. Timeline The public prosecution detained Al Jarrah on Friday and are charging him with accepting bribes from Islam in exchange for facilitating transactions for the MP's companies. Al Jarrah is still being held in detention. A director of a travel agency was also detained on Sunday, after the public prosecution obtained evidence tying him to the case. On Monday the public prosecution requested the parliament lift immunity on two MPs, Saadoun Hammad and Salah Khorshid, after Islam confessed that he paid them 570,000 Kuwaiti dinars (Dh6.8 million) in exchange for facilitating transactions to recruit Bangladeshi workers. On July 1, two government officials were arrested and sentenced to 21 days in prison. Their case is still under review by the public prosecutor. Islam is being held in Kuwait's central prison on three charges: human trafficking, money laundering and bribery. He was arrested on June 8. Kuwaiti authorities have frozen Islam's bank accounts and companies to ensure that the money is not moved around beyond the jurisdiction of Kuwaiti courts. The MP is the managing director and CEO of Marafie Kuwaitia Group, a security and labour contracting company. In addition, Islam has three other companies in Kuwait, all of which are cleaning and contracting companies. According to a report by Al Qabas, between April and June, various government agencies extended more than four governmental contracts with Islam's company, for cleaning and employment services. All four contracts put together total one million Kuwaiti dinars. Islam has an annual net profit of around two million Kuwaiti dinars after all the bribes and money he spent on gifts in exchange for facilitating transactions and paperwork to bring in workers from Bangladesh. There are 350,000 Bangladeshis residing in Kuwait, according to the embassy of Bangladesh.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/kuwait-annuls-paperwork-processed-general-regarding-papul-graft-scandal-106369", "date": "2020-07-15T10:20:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 15 July, 2020, 10:20 am Last modified: 15 July, 2020, 11:59 am", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 426, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:28.134517"}
{"title": "Hong Kong students banned from political activity", "body": "Students in Hong Kong are now banned from any political activity in schools including singing, posting slogans and boycotting classes. Last year, thousands of secondary school students became involved in Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests and some 1,600 students were arrested for joining the sometimes violent demonstrations. The order came on the same day that a new national Chinese security office opened in the city, reports BBC. The office is one element of a sweeping new law that makes inciting hatred of China's central government and Hong Kong's regional government illegal. The law has caused alarm in Hong Kong, with opponents saying it erodes the territory's freedoms as a semi-autonomous region of China. But officials say it will restore stability after violent protests. Hong Kong's sovereignty was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 and certain rights were supposed to be guaranteed for at least 50 years under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement. Last year hundreds and thousands protested for weeks in Hong Kong against an extradition bill that critics said undermined the city's special status. The anti-government movement's demands broadened to include full democracy and an inquiry into police brutality. In schools many children expressed their support for the demonstrations by drowning out the Chinese national anthem with protest song Glory To Hong Kong. Now Education Minister Kevin Yeung says schools must stamp out such demonstrations. Mr Yeung said the song Glory to Hong Kong was \"closely related to the social and political incidents, violence and illegal incidents that have lasted for months,\" according to Reuters news agency. \"Schools must not allow students to play, sing or broadcast it in schools,\" he said. Additionally authorities said students must not form human chains, chant slogans or express other political messages. Last week pro-democracy books were removed from public libraries, and authorities say they will be reviewed to see if they violate the new law. hong kong / political programme / Students / Ban", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/south-asia-china/hong-kong-students-banned-political-activity-103813", "date": "2020-07-09T09:25:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 09 July, 2020, 09:25 am Last modified: 09 July, 2020, 09:46 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 324, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:30.153032"}
{"title": "Britain to spend 705 million pounds on EU border infrastructure", "body": "Britain will spend 705 million pounds ($890 million) on border infrastructure to help keep trade flowing after its transition deal with the European Union expires at the end of the year, Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove said on Sunday. The funding includes 470 million pounds to build port and inland infrastructure, including in the south-east of England to serve major freight crossings to France. \"There will be specific pieces of infrastructure that we put in place in order to smooth the flow of traffic,\" Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Britain, which is still in talks with the European Union about a post-Brexit trade deal, said it would shortly set out in detail how the British-EU border would operate. Gove's cabinet colleague International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, in a leaked letter published by Business Insider, voiced concerns about legal challenges to the border proposals and the risk that ports will not be ready in time. Asked whether Britain's borders would be ready and secure by the end of the year, Gove said he thought they would be. \"I am absolutely certain that everything that we do is compliant with the law, indeed is designed to ensure that we can not just comply with the law and keep people safe, but also facilitate trade as well,\" he said. Gove said there had been \"movement\" in the negotiations between Britain and the EU about a post-transition trade deal. \"There are hopeful signs, but I wouldn't want to be over-enthusiastic,\" he said. The border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and EU member Ireland will be subject to specific guidance. \"We will be saying more about how we are going to implement the Northern Ireland protocol later this month,\" Gove said.

The company has reported negative growth both in revenue and in number of subscribers. After the first half of the year, the investment in network expansion has decreased by 63.29 percent compared to the investment in the same time in the previous year. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel In the last six months, the service provider invested only Tk290 crore, way down from Tk790 crore in the same period of 2019. The service provider reported a total revenue of Tk3,310 crore for the second quarter of 2020, registering an 8.2 percent de-growth from the same period last year. Net profit after taxes for the second quarter was Tk730 crore, with a 22 percent margin. Earnings per share (EPS) for the period stood at Tk5.38. The service provider reported 74.5 million total customers, of which 54.8 percent, or 40.8 million, are internet customers. Grameenphone lost two million subscribers during the first half, of which 0.8 million subscribers left the fleet solely in the second quarter of 2020, the company said in a press release on Wednesday. However, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) data shows that the service provider lost around 2.20 million subscribers in the last five months. Financial results of the first half reflect a business calamity that the country's biggest operator has been facing. From July 01, the regulator has imposed two new restrictions on Grameenphone, declaring it a significant market power (SMP) service provider. In July last year, BTRC stopped Grameenphone from making new investments – in a move to realise its disputed audit claims from the company. From then, the service provider was unable to expand its networks till February this year. These issues thwarted the service provider's quality of services and have had an impact on the business. Grameenphone also said the drop in revenue and the number of subscribers is a combine aftermath of challenges that appeared both from the nature and the regulatory end. \"For the past four months, we have been experiencing the impact of an unprecedented global pandemic which has driven us to drastically change our way of work and how we serve our customers,\" said Yasir Azman, chief executive officer of Grameenphone. \"In addition to Covid-19, we have experienced an impact from challenging weather and regulatory scenario, all of which combined has driven us to degrowth in our performance compared to last year,\" he added.

Our commitment remains to investing in the country and using our technology expertise to aid the government in battling Covid-19.\" \"We are pleased to announce that the Grameenphone Board of Directors declared interim dividend at the rate of 130 percent of the paid-up capital,\" he added.

{"title": "Dressing your face for the last night of the year", "body": "The excitement that comes with the last night of the year, a mix of looking back at where we have been and getting ready for what is next, is different from any other occasion. Most of us feel like putting in that extra bit of effort to look and feel our best, even if the plan is just a casual get-together. But while New Year's Eve is the perfect excuse to play around with your look, you do not necessarily have to veer too far from your comfort zone to feel special. \"I always tell people to have a rough idea in advance, especially in Bangladesh, where New Year's plans often involve last-minute changes,\" said freelance makeup artist Farhana Chowdhury. While you don't need a rigid, step-by-step plan, Farhana suggests that having a general direction helps keep things from getting overwhelming. If you find yourself without one, she insists there's no need to panic. \"Decide the overall mood, whether you want something fresh, bold, or glamorous—but leave the final call for the day itself. Our weather, skin condition, and even our mood can change quickly, so flexibility helps. Makeup should feel enjoyable, not stressful.\" So, how do you actually land on a look? Hafsa Ibrahim, a fashion enthusiast, choreographer, and programme coordinator at The Flow Fest, shared that the environment usually dictates the direction. \"The outfit and the kind of gathering matter most to me. A house party, a formal dinner, or a big night out all call for very different makeup. If it's a long night, I'll lean towards something more long-lasting and practical.\" Farhana agrees that the occasion is the biggest factor. According to her, a family dinner, rooftop gathering, restaurant party, or late-night hangout with friends all call for different levels of makeup intensity. Weather and comfort should also be considered, so the makeup looks polished while still being practical and long-lasting. Over the years, the preference for heavy, 'cakey' makeup has faded. Farhana notes that while NYE used to be defined by heavy foundation and aggressive contouring, the trend has moved toward a more natural, skin-focused finish. However, makeup artist Sura Chowdhury reminds us that you don't always have to chase what's new just because it's a big event. \"Makeup doesn't have to follow a trend specifically for a big event. A lot of people just like to stick to their usual things,\" the make-up artist commented. The no-makeup look If you are wondering what's currently at the forefront, Sura points out that minimalism is still leading the way. \"The whole year 2025 was all about a very minimal look or the 'no-makeup' makeup look. So, I think that is going to stay on trend.\" Actress and model Riya Ghosh is a fan of this change. \"I really loved how, in recent times, people have embraced the natural makeup look. People are accepting their flaws and not trying to hide them.\" Farhana sees this continuing as well, noting that people now prefer makeup that highlights their features instead of masking them. She expects to see more personalised looks, better skin prep, and lighter bases with thoughtful details. Hafsa also agrees with this lighter approach. \"It's going to be a mix of socialising and celebrating, so I want something that looks polished but not over-the-top. I want to feel confident without feeling like I'm wearing too much makeup,\" she explained. The return of glam While the natural look is huge, Sura Chowdhury predicts that full-on glam might be making a comeback for the new year. \"The past few years, the trends kept jumping from glam to no-makeup makeup. 2016 was the year of full glam, while 2019 welcomed the idea of editorials. By 2022, everyone had that minimal makeup done with their 'clean girl' aesthetic and the sleek hair bun.\" According to her, in 2025, we all adapted to what we like individually, so there isn't much of a single 'trend' to follow. However, she said, \"I can totally see full glam making a comeback. Which is why this year I feel people are putting their minimal makeovers on the back burner and trusting a good glam session.\" Embrace full glamour with glowing skin, shimmering eyes and sultry, glossy lips. Eyes, lips and skin Farhana suggests that for those going for a more 'glam' look, the technique is softening. \"Soft smoky eyes, especially in browns, bronze, or charcoal, are replacing harsh black smoky looks.\" Riya Ghosh is planning something similar for her own celebration. \"Since I'm hosting a house party, I am opting for a minimal look without any heavy foundation,\" she shared. \"To elevate my look, I will focus on the eyes and highlight them. Maybe I will use a bit of shimmer on them and go for a soft smoky eye,\" Riya added. Sura, who has a keen interest in unique editorial eyes, wants to push the boundaries for her own look. \"I want to bring back the colours—the things I'm known for, like more editorial looks. Not gemstones, but blends and adding more colour to my eye makeup. And as for my beautiful clients, it'll always be their own preference first.\" You cannot talk about New Year's without the classics. \"Clean, glowing skin paired with a classic red or deep berry lip looks stunning and timeless,\" shared Farhana. Riya is also reaching for those deeper shades. \"It's for the night, so I would go for red or a bit of dark red lipstick. Since I am planning to wear black attire, I think such a lipstick shade will go with the look really well.\" \"Dewy makeup is still popular, but it should look fresh, not oily, especially in our climate,\" says Farhana. She suggests that minimal makeup with a subtle shimmer works beautifully for intimate parties. Hafsa is on the same page: \"I'm leaning towards glowy skin, softly defined eyes, and a statement lip, something festive but still very me.\" She also added a crucial reminder, \"The best makeup is proper skin care.\" Making the look last To make sure your look stays put through the countdown, Farhana suggests a light touch. \"The secret is layering lightly. Use thin layers of foundation and cream products where possible, and set only where needed,\" said Farhana. \"A setting spray helps lock everything in without making the skin look dry. Blotting instead of adding more powder also keeps the makeup fresh,\" she added. Sura has a specific technique for longevity: \"To make your makeup last longer, always spray a setting spray such as Milani's Make It Dewy in-between each of your steps and seal it at the end with a fixing spray such as the One/Size On 'Till Dawn or L'Oreal's 3-second setting spray.\" \"Definitely avoid these fixing sprays if you have dry skin. Instead, just lock it in with Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless setting spray,\" she concluded.

{"title": "Govt to show no leniency over neutrality of law enforcers during polls: Home adviser", "body": "Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury has warned that the government will not show any leniency over the neutrality of law enforcement agencies while they perform duties during the upcoming national election and referendum. Strict action would be taken against anyone involved in unethical practices during the election, including those who act out of greed, engage in wrongdoing, evade responsibility, or neglect their duties, he said while speaking as the chief guest at the \"Bangladesh Coast Guard Medal Award Ceremony 2026,\" organised at the Coast Guard headquarters in Agargaon, Dhaka this morning (3 February). \"If any member of the Coast Guard or other law enforcement agencies is found to be involved in implementing the agenda of any individual, group, or political party, departmental action along with stringent legal measures will be taken against the concerned personnel,\" he added. Highlighting the contributions of the Coast Guard, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said the force has been working courageously to ensure security in coastal areas and inland waterways, prevent illegal fishing, curb arms and drug smuggling, human trafficking, robbery, and piracy. He also noted that the Coast Guard regularly conducts patrols and has successfully carried out rescue operations for distressed vessels and sailors. He further said that by ensuring security in border river areas, the Coast Guard is playing a vital role not only in preventing human trafficking and arms and drug smuggling but also in ensuring regional maritime security. In recognition of these contributions, countries including the United States and Australia have praised the force and expressed interest in working jointly with it. Referring to the 13th national election and referendum scheduled for 12 February, the home adviser said around 900,000 members of law enforcement agencies, including 3,585 Coast Guard personnel, have been deployed nationwide to ensure a free, fair, peaceful, and neutral election. As part of the deployment, 100 platoons have already been stationed in various districts of Barishal, Chattogram, and Khulna divisions. Describing corruption as the biggest enemy of the state, he said corruption erodes state institutions from within and destroys public trust. Responding to a question from journalists, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said some incidents of violence have occurred in connection with the election, but the situation has not worsened. \"Compared to previous national elections, the level of violence is much lower, and law enforcement agencies are continuing their operations,\" he said. He added that most of the reported incidents of violence stemmed from internal conflicts and factionalism within political parties, which are relatively difficult for law enforcement agencies to control. \"We are trying our best, but all concerned must exercise patience and remain vigilant,\" he said. At the event, medals were awarded to 40 Coast Guard members for their outstanding contributions in the line of duty. The ceremony was chaired by Coast Guard Director General Rear Admiral Md Ziaul Haque, while Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Nasimul Ghani was present as a special guest.

Both teams took the knee for 30 seconds in solidarity with the BLM movement before the start of play on Wednesday. \"It meant the world to me. Just the support from everyone, everyone understanding the moment, everyone understanding the occasion. And to see both teams coming together the way they did, it sent a really strong message,\" Holder told 'Sky Sports' on Thursday. \"I happened to be on social media last night, and I saw a few Aussies posting the same pic of everyone on the knee, and it just shows the cricket world is actually unified. But I think we could come a lot closer, we could do a lot more for cricket in general.\"Holder led from the front on day two, taking a career-best 6 for 42 to put his team his in a good position. With the rain delaying the start of play on Wednesday, Holder's powerful address on racism went viral on social media and moved the entire cricketing fraternity. The West Indies great said racism would not stop until the entire human race is educated on the subject. He said achievements of blacks have been deliberately omitted from the education system and the race has been dehumanised over several years. \"I must say, I saw the interview with Mikey yesterday, and I felt in my veins, to be honest. To me it was powerful, I think he hit the nail on the head, he was spot on,\" said Holder. \"For me it's more of an education. Guys need to make themselves aware of what's in front of us. There's a bigger picture sometimes in sport, but in the grand scheme of things, I just think we just need to be aware, we need to educate ourselves, and we need to have a level playing field for everyone.\"Holding was listening to Holder's interview and responded by saying that \"I don't think you need to thank me, Jason.

{"title": "The video of the hattrick always cheers me up: Taskin", "body": "Sri Lanka had already gone past 300 runs. Taskin Ahmed came into the attack to bowl the 50th over. He went for five runs off the first two deliveries. But what he did in the next three deliveries became part of history. Taskin sent back Asela Gunaratne in the third delivery of the 50th over. He bowled a full toss in the next delivery and Suranga Lakmal hit that straight to Mustafizur Rahman at midwicket. The thought of picking up a hattrick peeked into the mind of the right-arm fast bowler. Nuwan Pradeep was the last man in for Sri Lanka. Taskin decided to bowl the yorker, his proven weapon. The ball landed right into the blockhole and hit the timber. Taskin Ahmed became the fifth bowler in the history of Bangladesh cricket to pick up an ODI hattrick. Bangladesh couldn't bear the fruit of the hattrick as rain interrupted the match and it was called off after the first innings. In the final episode of The Business Standard's hattrick-hero series, we bring you the story of Taskin Ahmed who picked up a hattrick against Sri Lanka in 2017. In Taskin's words... A hattrick is always a hattrick, a different feeling altogether. Every bowler has the dream of picking up a hattrick and a five-wicket haul. I am no different. I was on a hattrick quite a few times earlier, but it didn't come off. After getting two in two that day, the inner self me was saying that this was the time to do it. I went for the yorker. It landed exactly where I wanted and the hattrick happened. Everyone congratulated me after the hattrick. It would've been more special if I got the hattrick a little earlier. When I came to bowl the last over, Soumya (Sarkar) was telling me from midwicket, \"Go for it. It may come off if the Almighty wants.\" What I remember most is my run-up to the crease for the hattrick ball. It was the 50th over and no one told me what to do, what not to do. I just bowled to my own plan and things turned out really well. I was a tad disappointed because we couldn't bat in the second innings. 300 was a par score on that ground and I felt we could've won the game. I watch the video often. Sometimes I watch this video and the video of the World Cup match against England to cheer myself up. I really feel proud of that achievement. It doesn't matter who the opponents were or when I achieved it. It's a record which cannot be erased. I was very confident after I had dismissed Gunaratne and Lakmal. I was on top of my game and trusted my ability to go for my strongest weapon. I want to pick up more hattricks in future. I did that three years back. It's quite a long time ago. A hattrick or a five-wicket haul gives you immense pleasure no matter who the opponents are. We work hard for these moments. And if you can do so in a crunch moment, it makes you happier. I want to pick up a hattrick in the first spell. This will definitely go down as one of my greatest performances in international cricket. I would have my debut right on top where I got five for 28 against India in 2014. The second one would be the spell of three for 47 against England in 2016 where I dismissed Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler and Chris Woakes. And the hattrick will follow that performance.

{"title": "Weekes and his unconquered 5 tons on the trot", "body": "Sir Everton Weekes passed away very recently (July 1). Condolences and obituaries have been pouring down from all over the cricketing world. Everyone who knew him was saddened surely, but most chose to celebrate his life rather than mourn his departure. And a life worth celebrating it was! Apart from being one third of the famous \"Three Ws\", Weekes held many great records. A prolific run-getter of his era, Everton de Courcy Weekes amassed 4,455 runs from 48 Tests with an astonishing average of 58.61 and over 12 thousand runs in first-class cricket. His most famous feat was the record of scoring five consecutive Test match centuries, last of which he hit in January 1949. The record still stands strong after 71 years. The first of those five centuries was also his first at the Test arena and in his debut series. Weekes began playing for the West Indies at the tender age of 22 and started with a string of low scores against England in 1948. In that home series his first five scores were 35, 25, 36, 20 and 36 in the first three matches. But he turned it around in the fourth Test as he scored a 141 - his first Test ton. No one ever presumed that it was the beginning of something really special. But for his next Test century - Weekes now assured of his place in the Test side - had to wait for almost 10 months. West Indies were scheduled to tour the subcontinent in October for a five match Test series against India. Before the Test series began in November, the Caribbean side played two first class matches against Pakistan in Karachi and Lahore, both ending in a draw. Weekes carried his form from the last Test he played in Jamaica to the first match he played in India. In the series opener in Delhi, he batted number seven and on a belter of a pitch, joined his teammates in the run fest. He was the fourth West Indian batsman to get a hundred in that innings. So his 128 runs went fairly unnoticed. They were all-out for 631 and that was the only innings that the Windies batted. In the second match in Mumbai however, he was able to catch everyone's attention with a blistering 194. He was promoted to bat at number 4 after his hundred in the previous match. He kept on mauling the Indian attack and was the last batsman to be dismissed. The visitors declared on 629/6, and they did not bat again in the match. Everton Weekes now had two centuries in two innings. In the third Test the West Indies, luckily for Weekes, batted twice and the prolific right-hander registered a hundred in both innings. In Kolkata, the visitors batted first and were all out for 366, with Weekes scoring 162. In Reply, India were bundled out for 272. In their second innings the West Indies declared on 369 for 9, with Weekes scoring 101. It was his fifth ton in five innings. An unprecedented cricketing event then and somehow the record still stands. But Weekes could have added another one, had he not been given run out on 90, under controversial circumstances in the next Test in Madras (now Chennai). Remember the time was 1949, and there were no TV umpires or any such technologies. \"I thought the (square-leg umpire's) decision was a very bad one. But in the game of cricket, I suppose, the element of decision-making would not always depend on the right result. I don't think there is any dishonesty attached to it,\" Weekes later told Wisden in an interview. He added one more fifty to his caddy before the series ended. In total Weekes accumulated 779 runs with an average of 111.28. Weekes and the West Indies went on to play Ceylon Cricket Team (Now Sri Lanka) after their tour of India ended in February. Weekes continued with his run scoring form and came up with another three digit innings in Colombo. But as Ceylon was a non-Test playing nation at that time, those matches were considered as first-class games. While his run-scoring prowess was never under question, Weekes' career was marred by muscle injuries in the late 1950s. He retired in 1958 at the age of 33. His record of five consecutive Test hundreds is yet to be broken. His Test career average of 58.61 is the second best amongst West Indians and tenth amongst all the Test playing nations.

{"title": "Garcia hat-trick helps Real Madrid beat Betis 5-1 to cut gap on Barcelona", "body": "Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Garcia bagged a hat-trick to lead his side to a 5-1 victory over Real Betis at the Bernabeu on Sunday, trimming the deficit to LaLiga leaders Barcelona to four points. Xabi Alonso's side, who topped the table before a downturn in November, now have 45 points from 19 matches, second behind defending champions Barcelona, who beat Espanyol away yesterday (4 January). Betis are sixth with 28 points. Garcia, who lit up last year's FIFA Club World Cup with four goals, stepped up in the absence of LaLiga's top scorer Kylian Mbappe, sidelined by a knee injury. The 21-year-old was left unmarked at the far post to head in Rodrygo's precise cross for a deserved 20th-minute lead. He doubled Real's lead early in the second half with a superb chest control and volley from Federico Valverde's long ball, before Raul Asencio added a header from another Rodrygo delivery. Betis forward Cucho Hernandez pulled one back in the 66th minute, moments after Giovani Lo Celso struck the post, and the visitors looked more lively following the goal. Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois then produced a string of saves to deny Rodrigo Riquelme and blocked a shot from Antony to preserve Madrid's advantage. Garcia completed his hat-trick in the 82nd minute with a superb back‑heel finish from Arda Guler's assist, before Fran Garcia rounded off the rout in stoppage time by converting Valverde's cross past goalkeeper Alvaro Valles. The win was Madrid's third in a row and kept the pressure on their arch‑rivals. \"Right now, I'm pretty happy. It's a great way to start the year. Three goals that are special, my first goal this season and my first hat-trick at the Bernabeu,\" Garcia said. \"Mbappe is currently the best player in the world, he gives us a lot with his goals. My teammates and the manager give me all their trust. I just go out there and give it my best. \"We know how demanding Real Madrid is, I have the best players in the world in front of me.

{"title": "With few flyers, airlines continue to lose money", "body": "Although flight operations have resumed on a limited scale, the aviation industry is yet to gain pace as passengers are reluctant to travel amid a surge in infections and new quarantine measures in destination countries. For instance, after the air travel ban was lifted, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its first international commercial flight to London on June 21 with 70% seats full. But it returned with only 23 passengers, a load factor of less than 30% causing loss of above Tk10 lakh from its first international flight since the flight suspensions from May 17 because of the pandemic. This flight from Dhaka was full as most of the passengers had purchased their tickets before suspension of flight operations. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel In the domestic sector, Biman was able to operate flights for just one day before cancelling all subsequent flights because not enough people were flying. The cash-strapped national carrier resumed operations by taking out a loan of Tk1,000 crore in May from Sonali Bank under the Tk30,000 crore stimulus package. But operational losses of the company have been widening due to the crisis of passengers. Revenue losses of the company stood at around Tk400 crore until March, but it almost quadrupled to Tk1,527 crore in May, according to Biman. This loss in revenues has also impacted the ticket fare. Biman has been charging a higher price than usual for the London route. \"The aviation industry had started to move slowly, but quarantine measures in destination countries have discouraged passengers from travelling,\" said Md Mokabbir Hossain, managing director of Biman. \"As a result, we are operating flights at a loss. We do not know how long we can continue,\" he added. Biman used to operate flights on 17 international routes before the Covid-19 outbreak. It is now operating only on the London route once a week. However, it is going to resume scheduled flights in two more international destinations, Dubai and Abudhabi from 6 and 7 July respectively. Some other foreign airlines including – Turkish Airlines, Qatar and Emirates airways – are allowed to operate international flights from Dhaka. However, Turkish Airlines' earlier announcement that it would restart its flights from Dhaka on Friday has been cancelled. This flight suspension will be in effect till July 7. A Turkish Airlines source says the Turkish government took the decision not to allow flights from countries where the infection rate was rising. Though airlines are slowly restarting their flight operations in international routes, international passenger demand is still very discouraging for airlines. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in a recent study says that passenger demand in May dropped 91.3% compared to May 2019. This was a mild uptick from the 94% annual decline recorded in April 2020. The improvement was driven by recovery in some domestic markets, most notably China. \"May was not quite as terrible as April. That's about the best thing that can be said. As predicted, the first improvements in passenger demand are occurring in domestic markets. International traffic remained virtually stopped in May. We are only at the very beginning of a long and difficult recovery. And there is tremendous uncertainty about what impact a resurgence of new Covid-19 cases in key markets could have,\" said IATA in its press release. All Asia-Pacific, Middle Eastern and European carriers' May demand plunged more than 98% compared to last year, according to IATA. \"Bangladesh is the only country to have reopened scheduled flights on the international routes when infection rates are high,\" said Air Vice Marshall Md Mofidur Rahman, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB). He said a Covid-19 negative certificate is mandatory to enter Bangladesh. But other countries do not accept these as somebody who tested negative today might test positive the next day. \"Other countries are very restrictive and have mandated a 14-day quarantine measure. But Europe and the US are not so strict,\" he added. At the moment, China is not allowing any foreign nationals to enter due to a second wave of Covid-19 outbreak in the country. India has still not resumed international flights. Although the infection rate is very low in Thailand, it still mandates 14 days of quarantine on arrival for international passengers. Though Bangladesh is allowing foreign nationals to enter, the rising infection rate has put the country on restricted lists of other nations. For instance, Japan and South Korea recently limited the entry of foreigners from some countries where Covid-19 infections are surging, including Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) opposes the quarantine measures, saying this has stopped people from travelling altogether. \"Imposing quarantine measures on arriving travellers keep countries in isolation and the travel and tourism sector in lockdown,\" the IATA said in a recent press release. Mandatory quarantine measures stop people from traveling, it said, adding recent public opinion research revealed that 83% of travellers would not even consider travelling if quarantine measures were imposed on them after arriving at a destination. \"Analysis of trends during the lockdown period shows that countries imposing quarantine saw arrivals decrease by more than 90% – an outcome that is similar to countries that banned foreign arrivals,\" the press release reads. The IATA said a layered approach to safety has made flying the safest way to travel while still enabling the system to function efficiently. \"That should be an inspirational framework to guide governments in protecting their citizens from the terrible risks of both the virus and joblessness. Quarantine is a lopsided solution that protects one and absolutely fails at the other,\" the press release adds. \"Safely restarting the economy is a priority. That includes travel and tourism. Quarantine measures may play a role in keeping people safe, but they will also keep many unemployed. The alternative is to reduce risks through a series of measures,\" the IATA stated. In the domestic front, US-Bangla Airlines has been operating flights with a 30% load factor. Despite losses, the carrier is continuing operations to get air travellers to start flying again. The carrier is also offering tickets at low prices to bring in passengers. \"People are not travelling as there are no business activities,\" said Sikder Mezbahuddin Ahmed, adviser to US-Bangla. \"Moreover, the rising number of infections has also kept passengers away from travelling.\" Despite this situation, US-Bangla is offering tickets at a minimum price of Tk2,500, and the carrier is continuing flight operations with all protective measures to build trust among travellers, he said. US-Bangla incurred losses of around Tk400 crore until June after the Covid-19 outbreak. The company sought a loan of that amount under the Tk30,000 crore stimulus package, but got only Tk16 crore. This amount can support the operator for just one week, Mezbahuddin added.

As a result, sales volume decreased, although operating costs remained the same, he added. \"Therefore, our cash flow scenario did not support the paying out of cash dividends as final dividends for the year 2019.\" At the end of 2019, the company's net operating cash flow per share was Tk68.66, which was Tk5.88 negative at the end of March, 2020. Bata posted a 50 percent decline in its net profit to Tk49.39 crore last year. Its earnings per share stood at Tk36.11. However, in 2017, the footwear manufacturer posted a net profit of Tk115 crore. It gave out a 335 percent cash dividend to its shareholders that year. Despite its net profit coming down to Tk99 crore in 2018, Bata gave out a 345 percent cash dividend to its shareholders that year. Meanwhile, in the first quarter of the current financial year, the company witnessed an 8 percent fall in sales to reach Tk163.68 crore. During this period, the net profit also went down by 37 percent to Tk2.83 crore and earnings per share stood at Tk2.07. On Thursday, the closing price of the company's each share was Tk693.20 at the Dhaka Stock Exchange, while its highest price was Tk1,047 within the last one year. The company, listed with the share market in 1985, has a paid-up capital of Tk14 crore. Bata UK holds 70 percent of the total shares of Bata Shoe Company (Bangladesh) Limited. Institutional, foreign and general investors hold 18.97 percent, 1.94 percent and 9.09 percent shares, in that order, of the company.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/stock/bata-recommends-no-dividend-first-time-104356", "date": "2020-07-10T11:45:00+06:00", "author": "Ahsan Habib Tuhin 10 July, 2020, 11:45 am Last modified: 10 July, 2020, 11:51 am", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 387, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:53.717220"}
{"title": "#MeToo wave hit Egypt", "body": "More than 100 accusers have emerged online in the past two weeks, triggering a new #MeToo movement in Egypt. The girls and women described meeting a young man — a former student at Egypt's most elite university in person and online, followed by deceit, then escalating sexual harassment, assault, blackmail or rape. Some were minors when the alleged crimes took place, reports Associated Press. The suspect was arrested last week from his home in a gated community outside Cairo. \"What's before this case is totally different from what's after,\" said Nihad Abuel-Komsan, head of the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights and a lawyer representing some of the alleged victims. In a statement, the public prosecutor's office said the accused acknowledged he blackmailed at least six girls, saying he would send sensitive photos of them to their families if they cut ties. At least 10 women have officially reported their claims, according to Abuel-Komsan, of the women's rights center. Activists also set up the Instagram account @assaultpolice to collect allegations, said Sabah Khodir, a US-based writer who helps run the account. She said there are more than 100 accounts. A court has ordered the accused to remain in custody pending an investigation into an array of accusations that include attempted rape, blackmail and indecent assault, according to a five-page statement by the public prosecutor. In the same statement, the prosecutor urged more alleged victims to come forward. Last week, the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi moved to amend the country's criminal law to increase protections for the identities of sexual assault victims, which activists have welcomed. The amendment still needs parliamentary approval and el-Sissi's signature to be made law. The current series of complaints has prompted Egypt's Al-Azhar, the Sunni Muslim world's foremost religious institution, to speak out on sexual harassment and assault, even challenging the widely held belief that a woman is at fault if her clothing is less than modest. There are also other corners where accusations of sexual harassment are emerging, such as in civil society groups and businesses.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/metoo-wave-hit-egypt-105781", "date": "2020-07-13T22:00:00+06:00", "author": "AP/UNB 13 July, 2020, 10:00 pm Last modified: 13 July, 2020, 10:01 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 341, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:55.733063"}
{"title": "Alternate Wetting and Drying: What’s holding Bangladesh back from a promising irrigation practice?", "body": "Rice is the staple crop in Bangladesh, covering about 75% of arable land. Continuous flooding in rice fields is a long-standing practice and widely believed to be essential for high yields. This practice, however, poses a two-fold challenge. First, flooded rice fields emit large amounts of methane — a potent greenhouse gas. Irrigated rice fields account for around 62% of the country's total methane emissions. Second, this cultivation method exerts immense pressure on groundwater, as most irrigated rice in the country relies heavily on pumped water. To meet food-security goals while advancing climate and water sustainability, these twin challenges must be addressed without compromising yields. One promising solution is Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), an irrigation management practice that intermittently dries rice fields instead of keeping them continuously flooded. Research across South and Southeast Asia shows that such irrigation practices can cut methane emissions by 30–70% and reduce irrigation water use by 20–70% without affecting yields. In Bangladesh, studies suggest AWD can increase farm profits by 7–10%, mainly by lowering irrigation costs, which make up about 30% of rice production expenses. Properly managed AWD also allows deeper root growth, reducing harvest losses and sometimes even improving yields. Moreover, it opens opportunities for earning carbon credits by cutting emissions from one of agriculture's largest sources. Yet despite nearly two decades of trials since the mid-2000s, AWD adoption remains very low, with fewer than 4% of farmers practising it at scale. The reasons lie in weak incentives, policy gaps, and behavioural barriers. Bangladesh's irrigation is dominated by fixed-cost, serial-based pumping. Pump owners supply water to farmers in scheduled turns for a flat seasonal fee. Because the cost is fixed, farmers tend to draw as much water as possible during their allotted turn. Since continuous flooding is seen as essential for good yields, neither farmers nor pump owners have much incentive to conserve water. Water pricing and pumping controls are largely absent in agriculture, which consumes up to 88% of all pumped groundwater. Regulations apply mainly to urban and industrial uses, which together consume about 12%. Moreover, irrigation subsidies and the expansion of solar-powered pumps further reduce pumping costs, discouraging water conservation and limiting AWD uptake. Although national policy documents encourage water-saving technologies, AWD has not been mainstreamed into agricultural extension services. In practice, subsidies for irrigation and solar pumps often work against AWD by making water cheaper to overuse. A prepaid irrigation system introduced in the drought-prone Barind region showed promise: farmers using prepaid cards tended to reduce pumping hours and adopt AWD. However, weak monitoring and limited enforcement stalled wider diffusion. Currently, AWD promotion falls under the Department of Environment, which must coordinate with the Department of Agricultural Extension — a collaboration still weak in practice. By contrast, countries like Vietnam have seen greater success through policy alignment. There, farmers' cooperatives coordinate irrigation schedules, manage pumps, enforce pumping limits, and extension agencies actively train farmers on AWD under clear institutional mandates — enabling widespread adoption. Beyond technical feasibility, AWD uptake depends on farmer education, land tenure, topography, and soil type. Studies in Bangladesh find higher adoption among farmers with more education, secure land ownership, flatter fields, and access to reliable weather information. For smallholders, who are often risk-averse, the lack of training and the belief that continuous flooding is \"safer\" for yields remain major obstacles. Overcoming these barriers requires large-scale training and demonstrations, which usually follow from clear policy priorities. To scale AWD and realise its water- and emission-saving potential, Bangladesh must take a holistic approach. First, AWD should be mainstreamed in agricultural extension programmes, treated not as a niche trial but as a core component of climate-smart rice cultivation. Aligning incentives is also critical: irrigation models should be reformed so that farmers and pump owners share the savings from reduced pumping, whether through volumetric pricing, prepaid systems, or command-area incentives, with subsidies targeting pump owners to reward efficiency rather than consumption. Collective irrigation governance should be promoted by encouraging the formation and strengthening of irrigation cooperatives, as seen in Vietnam, since past efforts that focused solely on individual farmers or pump owners often faltered once projects ended. Efforts should target high-priority regions, particularly groundwater-depleted and high-cost areas, guided by hydrological and economic data; areas such as Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, Naogaon, and parts of Chattogram have recently been designated as critically water-stressed, where AWD could be transformative. Finally, strengthening monitoring and adaptive learning is essential: continuous evaluation of AWD under diverse agro-ecological conditions will refine guidelines, while robust institutional monitoring will help prevent post-intervention dis-adoption. Scaling AWD is as much about political will as technical feasibility. Reforming water pricing, extension services, and irrigation business models are all politically sensitive in a developing democracy like Bangladesh. Encouragingly, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has included AWD promotion in its policy priorities ahead of the February 2026 national election, aiming to cut emissions, curb groundwater depletion, and earn carbon credits from agriculture. This could provide a window of opportunity: if such manifesto commitments translate into actionable policies post-election, AWD could finally move from project-based trials to mainstream practice. However, political commitments must be matched with institutional capacity: the formation of farmer cooperatives, inter-ministerial coordination, extension systems, and irrigation governance all need strengthening. Simply placing AWD in policy documents is not enough. The case for AWD is compelling: it reduces emissions and water use, raises yields when properly managed, and can earn carbon credits. It could be a game-changing technology in Bangladesh. Yet institutional inertia, misaligned policies, weak incentives, and behavioural barriers continue to stall progress. With groundwater stress deepening and climate pressures mounting, scaling AWD is no longer optional — it is imperative. The coming years will determine whether political and institutional actors act decisively or allow AWD to remain an under-utilised good idea.

{"title": "European Film Festival: The Girl From Tomorrow strikes a chord in Bangladesh", "body": "The practice of a molester marrying his victim to evade justice is nothing new in Bangladesh. In fact, in the not-so-distant past, rural mediation courts often deemed it acceptable to approve and arrange such unions in order to save the victim from stigma and ostracism. Whether the victim actually wished to marry her abuser was never up for discussion, illustrating the hard truth that, in such situations, the woman in question had very little choice but to accept the will of community elders in order to maintain a semblance of social acceptability. In many cases, the perpetrators later proved violent as husbands because, in most instances, they had agreed to the marriage simply as an expedient way to avoid legal consequences. But even if the violator turned out to be decent, such arrangements could never be the solution; they only demean women and leave them languishing in a union born out of a condemnable act. At the European Film Festival 2025, which concluded on 07 December at BRAC University, the acclaimed Italian film The Girl from Tomorrow, centred on the theme of reparatory marriage, was screened. The 2022 film, based on events from 1966–67, depicts a rural part of Italy where one woman takes a defiant stance against a long-held abomination that commodified women and kept them subservient to inequitable social norms. One of the most compelling aspects of the film is its title — The Girl from Tomorrow. At first glance, it may suggest a sci-fi production, but in reality, it is a solemn drama exposing a deep social aberration that afflicted a European country not too long ago. Commenting on the title, journalist Anika Fatima observed, \"Actually, from what I feel, the main character of the film, Lia Crimi, played by Claudia Gusmano, is a woman who is not hostage to the insular beliefs of a rural Italian town; her views and outlook are far ahead, as if to suggest she is a person from years into the future.\" The same sentiment was echoed by filmmaker and documentarian Rakibul Hasan, \"In my view, most of the characters in the film are controlled by regressive and highly discriminatory values, whereas Lia stands alone with her progressive thoughts,\" added Rakibul. Social worker Anjum Dalia asserts that the film should be subtitled in Bangla and shown across Bangladesh, because \"in many distant and semi-isolated communities, the practice of reparatory marriage still exists.\" \"This deplorable culture persists even in communities with access to electricity, mobile networks and other modern amenities,\" observed Anjum, adding: \"A certain degree of discretion is followed in arranging reparatory marriages.\" But the question remains: is the victim willingly accepting such a proposal, or is she indoctrinated into saying kabool (\"I do\")? Anjum points to the persistence of social practices in rural Bangladesh, where outdated, humiliating and unjust demands are foisted upon women. \"The most unfortunate thing is that, in countless cases, the victim is shamed while the abuser basks in masculine triumphalism.\" Ending the festival with a poignant message: The European Film Festival 2025 began at the Shishu Academy on 04 December with the German film Transit, and concluded on 07 December with the Italian feature The Girl from Tomorrow. At the closing event, the Ambassador of the European Union, Michael Miller, and the Italian Ambassador to Bangladesh, Antonio Alessandro, both acknowledged the film's relevance at a time when the world is observing the '16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence'. \"It is fitting that the European Film Festival 2025 ends with a profound message that aligns with a significant social campaign aimed at raising awareness about gender violence,\" observed Michael Miller. The film contrasts Lia's desolation with sweeping images of a spectacular mountainous Italian village. While the girl stands up against the norm of marrying her rapist, her family fears reprisal because the abuser's family is influential and wealthy. This economic dichotomy — and its unsavoury intricacies — is all too familiar in Bangladesh. \"We have repeatedly come across out-of-court settlements in which the victim, often from a struggling socio-economic background, is silenced with a financial package,\" deplored Abdus Sattar, an advocate at the CMM Court in Dhaka. \"Looking back a few years, we recall the death of a young girl who was living in an upmarket area in Dhaka under the patronage of a wealthy person. Later, when the girl committed suicide, an instigation-to-murder charge was quashed, reportedly after a payment — hush money — was made to the victim's family.\" Discussing European films more broadly, film enthusiast and critic Zahirul Islam highlighted the need for a large-scale film festival both in Bangladesh and Europe, featuring the best arthouse productions from each side. The Italian presentation at the European Film Festival left a sobering impact, evoking a line from philosopher Antonio Gramsci, \"Telling the truth is always revolutionary.\" Towheed Feroze is a Media and Information Adviser at European Union in Bangladesh Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and views of The Business Standard", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/thoughts/european-film-festival-girl-tomorrow-strikes-chord-bangladesh-1308266", "date": "2025-12-13T03:05:00+06:00", "author": "Towheed Feroze 13 December, 2025, 03:05 am Last modified: 13 December, 2025, 03:11 am", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 869, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:26:59.731938"}
{"title": "US presses Bolivia to expel suspected Iranian spies, harden approach to militant groups: Sources", "body": "The United States is pushing Bolivia to kick suspected Iranian spies out of the South American country and designate Tehran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist group, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Washington also wants the government in La Paz to designate Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Palestinian militant organization Hamas - both of which the United States considers to be proxies of Tehran - as terrorist organizations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. The private diplomatic push comes amid a broader US effort to deepen its geopolitical influence in Latin America and diminish that of its adversaries in the region. Following an operation earlier in January to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, US officials quickly pushed the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez to curtail economic and security cooperation between Caracas and Tehran, according to a separate source familiar with the matter. For years, Venezuela and Iran had been steadfast allies. Asked for comment, the Bolivian foreign ministry said that \"there is still no completely defined position regarding this matter.\" The State Department did not respond to a request for comment, while the Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment. Spy games in South America Bolivia, a landlocked country of 12 million people located in the heart of South America, would at first glance seem to be an unlikely venue for a proxy struggle between major world powers. Some current and former US officials, however, said the nation has become an important base for Iran's diplomatic and intelligence operations throughout the continent. In part, that is because of what US officials have described as a permissive counterintelligence environment, as well as the nation's central location bordering several other nations, some of which have allegedly been the victim of attempted Hezbollah plots in recent years. Rick de la Torre, a retired senior CIA officer and former Caracas chief of station, said Iran's base of diplomatic and intelligence operations in Latin America was Venezuela. However, Bolivia and Nicaragua - where an authoritarian government has cool relations with Washington - have served as Tehran's \"secondary nodes\" in the region in recent years. \"(Bolivia's) value to Tehran was the permissive political climate, lighter scrutiny and central geography,\" de la Torre said. \"In practice, the pattern you see across Latin America is Iran and Hezbollah using the most permissive jurisdictions as hubs, then projecting quietly into more capable or higher-value states nearby.\" Changing political landscape Evo Morales, Bolivia's leftist president from 2006 to 2019, deepened ties to Iran over the course of his presidency, including on defense and security-related matters, arguing both nations were united in the fight against US imperialism. Morales and leftist President Luis Arce, who governed from 2020 until late last year, were widely seen by US officials as unreceptive to potential efforts to distance La Paz from Tehran. Now, however, US officials believe they have a unique opportunity following the October election of centrist Rodrigo Paz, whose presidency marks an end to two decades of near-continuous rule by the leftist MAS party. Paz's government, which has inherited significant economic turmoil and a fractious legislature, has sought to repair ties with Washington, while encouraging private investment. US officials have publicly welcomed Paz's election, and in December the US made Bolivia available for grant funding administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent US agency. Effort to counter Iran ramping up The sources said the Iran-related push in Bolivia is part of a broader US campaign in the region. In September, US ally Ecuador designated the IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, while Argentina designated Iran's Quds Force last week. The US advocated for both moves, the sources said. The IRGC has served as an elite military force loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, while the Quds Force is an IRGC branch responsible for overseas operations. While the current push to drive a geopolitical wedge between Iran and Latin America is not new, there are signs the effort is ramping up. A delegation including State Department and intelligence officials traveled to La Paz this month in part to discuss the potential terrorist designations, the sources said. US officials have also discussed pushing for terrorist designations in Chile, Peru and Panama, the officials added, though it is not clear they have yet discussed the matter with counterparts in those countries. Hezbollah operatives have been present in all of those nations, US officials have alleged, and all have US-aligned presidents or presidents-elect. The Panamanian foreign ministry said it had not discussed the issue with US officials. The Chilean foreign ministry said they don't comment on potential talks with other states, but added that Chile subscribes to the United Nations list of terrorist organizations. The Peruvian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Hezbollah, IRGC long active in Latin America Among the most recent high-profile IRGC operations in the region was an alleged assassination plot targeting the Israeli ambassador to Mexico, which was foiled last year by Mexican security services. The plot, which was first reported by Axios in 11 November, was orchestrated in part by an undercover Quds Force officer stationed in Caracas, one of the sources said. Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which is closely allied with Tehran, has long operated in Latin America, often generating revenue for its global operations by participating in illicit smuggling networks and occasionally orchestrating terrorist attacks. Still, while US officials broadly hold that Hezbollah maintains a permanent presence in Latin America, there is significant debate within the intelligence community regarding how robust that presence is. Some have characterized the group's fundraising operations in the region as well-organized and hierarchical, while others argue that some financial activities ascribed to Hezbollah are in fact a function of donations and remittances from Latin America's sizeable Lebanese diaspora that make their way to Hezbollah-linked individuals by happenstance. \"In my view, Hezbollah leadership does not micromanage every criminal scheme,\" said de la Torre, the retired CIA officer, \"but it does authorize and benefit from a global facilitation architecture that includes Latin America.\" Trump administration / Bolivia / Iran", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/usa/us-presses-bolivia-expel-suspected-iranian-spies-harden-approach-militant-groups", "date": "2026-01-25T12:05:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 25 January, 2026, 12:05 pm Last modified: 25 January, 2026, 12:09 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1024, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:27:01.733233"}

Citing security concerns, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had asked the ICC to shift the matches to Sri Lanka, the tournament's other host nation. The BCB held talks with ICC officials in Dhaka this week over the deadlock, but no solution was reached. In a statement, the BCB said: \"During the discussions, the BCB formally reiterated its request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh's matches to Sri Lanka.\" While the ICC has not issued an official comment, cricket website Cricinfo and several Indian media outlets reported on Monday that the BCB has been given until Wednesday to communicate its final decision. An ICC source told AFP that if Bangladesh withdraws from the World Cup, their place will be taken by Scotland, the highest-ranked team among those who failed to qualify. The 10th edition of the T20 World Cup will begin on 7 February. Bangladesh have been placed in Group C alongside England, West Indies, Nepal and Italy. Their matches are scheduled to be played in Kolkata and Mumbai. During discussions with the ICC, Bangladesh also proposed swapping groups with Ireland, who are placed in Group B. On 3 January, following instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Kolkata Knight Riders dropped Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League, sparking widespread anger in Bangladesh. Political relations between India and Bangladesh have deteriorated since a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 led to the ouster of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.

Beijing imposed a new national security law this week on the former British colony, despite protests from Hong Kong residents and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track. \"The Canadian government needs to explain to the rule of law, and explain to the world, why it allows fugitives not to bear their legal responsibilities,\" Hong Kong's security chief, John Lee, told a radio programme on Saturday. Lee was very disappointed and strongly opposed Canada's move, he added, as it let politics override the rule of law. The comments followed Canada's statement on Friday that it was suspending the treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of the new law and could boost immigration from the city. Canada would also bar the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters. On Saturday's programme, Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said she was disappointed and expressed extreme regret over Canada's move, adding that she thought it could probably violate international law. On Friday, a Hong Kong government spokesman described as \"totally unacceptable\" a bill passed by the U.S. Senate to penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new law. \"We reiterate that any 'sanctions' imposed under the act will not create an obligation for financial institutions under Hong Kong law,\" the spokesman said in a statement.

{"title": "Several 'broom march' held protesting Jamaat chief's 'insult to working women'", "body": "Several protest rallies, including symbolic \"broom marches,\" were held in different parts of the capital and at public universities today (1 February), condemning alleged remarks by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Shafiqur Rahman that protesters described as \"insulting to working women\". In the afternoon, a protest rally took place at the base of the Raju Sculpture near the Teacher-Student Centre (TSC) of Dhaka University. At the same time, a group of working women brought out a broom procession in the Kafrul area of Mirpur. Similar protests were also held at Jahangirnagar University in the evening. Addressing the gathering at Dhaka University, Socialist Students' Front President Mukta Barai said, \"Using women against the country's progress is not new for a political party; this has long been their policy. History and recent events prove this.\" She further said that working women must be shown due respect, that those responsible for such derogatory remarks should offer a public apology, and that women would continue their march forward despite attempts to undermine them. Former vice-president of the Dhaka University Shamsunnahar Hall Students' Union, Sheikh Tasnim Afroze Emi, said that some political parties are attempting to gain power by humiliating women. \"Since independence, they have failed to perform any responsibility successfully except hypocrisy,\" she said. She further alleged that their organisational structure functions in ways that undermine the state, adding that they have learned nothing from the past and have instead become \"more degenerate and fascist over time\". The protest in Mirpur's Kafrul area took place in the Baishteki area shortly before the start of Jamaat's election campaign there. To prevent any untoward incidents, law enforcement agencies erected barricades between the protesters and Jamaat supporters. At Jahangirnagar University, students organised a broom march from the central Shaheed Minar, marching through various halls and campus roads before ending at Bot Tola. Student activists from Bangladesh Chhatra Union, Socialist Students' Front, Jatiya Chhatra Shakti and Jatiyotabadi Chhatra Dal joined the procession. Meanwhile, writer and researcher Mahtab Uddin said Jamaat-e-Islami has repeatedly misled its supporters through falsehoods and staged dramas. \"The claim that their ameer's X account was hacked has failed to produce any evidence. If an account were hacked, the first step would be changing the password. Instead, they themselves changed it, this alone proves that the incident was a staged drama,\" he said. He added that Jamaat's derogatory attitude towards women has long been embedded in its ideology. \"This mindset of undermining the dignity of working women is actively practised at the grassroots level of the organisation,\" he said. Calling for accountability, Mahtab urged the Election Commission to conduct a proper investigation into the matter. \"If Jamaat fails to provide evidence, its ameer must offer a public apology,\" he added. The protest followed the circulation of a screenshot of a post from Shafiqur Rahman's verified X account that began spreading on social media last night. The post has since been deleted, with Jamaat claiming the account had been hacked. The now-deleted post read, \"On the question of women, Jamaat's position is neither confused nor apologetic – it is principled. We do not think women should come in leadership. In Jamaat, it is impossible. Allah did not permit this.\" It further stated, \"We believe that when women are pushed out of the home in the name of modernity, they are exposed to exploitation, moral decay, and insecurity. It's nothing but another form of prostitution. Social media vulgarity, workplace harassment, and commodification of women are not signs of progress – they are symptoms of moral collapse. \"We refuse to compromise with immorality, no matter how fashionable it becomes.\" The screenshot of the now-deleted post triggered widespread criticism from various quarters, including political parties and rights activists.

Earlier, BCB permitted the players to practice but soon changed the decision keeping the risk factors in mind. Akram Khan, chairman of cricket operations of BCB, stated that the cricketers might be allowed to start practising, ahead of this year's Asia Cup. But the former captain informed them that they would wait for another two weeks. A national team player, citing anonymity, told The Business Standard, \"We all want cricket to resume. But the safety of life is the first priority now.\" The cricketer also mentioned that there is no need to rush as all the upcoming bilateral series have been called off.

{"title": "Bangladesh ahead of India, Pakistan on 2020 SDG Index", "body": "Bangladesh has ranked 109th on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index 2020, ahead of India (117th), Pakistan (134th), and Afghanistan (139th) in South Asia. Other South Asian countries Bhutan (80th), Maldives (91st), Sri Lanka (94th), and Nepal (96th) have ranked above Bangladesh on the SDG Index. In South Asia, the country ranked fifth with a score of 63.5 out of 100. The Sustainable Development Report (SDR) 2020, including the SDG Index and Dashboards, which was released on June 30, is a complement to the official SDG indicators and the voluntary national reviews published by Cambridge University Press. The SDG dashboard highlighted that Bangladesh faces major challenges in reaching seven sustainable development goals out of seventeen, which are SDG: 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 16, and 17. Also, there are six significant challenges facing the country with the goal of sustainable development. However, the SDG dashboard indicates Bangladesh has achieved SDG 12 and 13. Last year, Bangladesh ranked 116th out of 162 countries with a score of 60.9. Overall, the country improved its ranking and score in the 2020 edition of the report. However, this improvement is very narrow, as the country is reported on track for only four SDG goals and moderately increasing towards the six goals. Sadly, the country is stagnant in its position for three goals and decreasing its position from the two goals. There is no data about two of the goals. On a surprising note, Vietnam – only four years younger than Bangladesh and the country's top RMG competitor – has ranked 49th in the 2020 index, 60 spots ahead. SDGs during the pandemic Some may not consider pursuing achieving the SDGs during a global pandemic. However, Director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network and first author of the report, Jeffrey D. Sachs sees this another way. He said, \"The Sustainable Development Goals are needed more than ever. Their bedrock principles of social inclusion, universal access to public services, and global cooperation are the guideposts for fighting Covid-19 as well as for the investment-led recovery the world should adopt to overcome the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.\" Spillover Index The report also published a spillover index, which indicates transboundary impacts generated by one country on others. Bangladesh ranked 23rd with a 99.4 score on the Spillover Index, indicating the country has a significantly less negative impact on other countries in achieving their SDG goals. Global Scenario Globally, Sweden replaced Denmark in the top position. Denmark ranked second – followed by Finland, France and Germany.

BSEC Chairman Professor Shibli Rubayat-Ul-Islam said this while talking to top alternative investment professionals on Tuesday. A delegation from the Venture Capital and Private Equity Association of Bangladesh (VCPEAB) led by Shameem Ahsan, chairman of VCPEAB and general partner of Pegasus Tech Ventures (formerly Fenox Venture Capital), met the BSEC chairman and his team through video conference. During the meeting, the team discussed different initiatives related to strengthening venture capital, private equity and startup ecosystems. VCPEAB also requested policy support to create a sustainable venture capital industry. The delegation put emphasis on the possible contribution by venture capital and private equity investments to boost trade, innovation, export and help create home-grown startups that can contribute to the securities market in Bangladesh. The BSEC chairman pledged to give support to work with VCPEAB on policies to nurture emerging industries. \"The BSEC is continuously working to make the investment environment easier and transparent in our country. We will certainly accommodate relevant changes that are necessary for the venture capital and private equity enterprises,\" he added. VCPEAB Chairman Shameem stressed the need to expand the scope of the venture capital and private equity industry with policy support to assist them to contribute to the economy through their investment in innovative startups. \"As a result, these startups can create an ecosystem that can contribute up to 2 percent of GDP of Bangladesh by 2025.\" Shameem also said, \"The success of global companies like Google and Facebook is not only attributed to their founders but also to the venture capital investors like Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and Greylock partners among others who supported them when they were only startups.\" \"Similarly, the best companies from Bangladesh will emerge with investments of venture capital and private equity funds.\" BSEC Commissioner Dr Shaikh Shamsuddin Ahmed said they will give all kinds of support to improve the startup and venture capital industry in Bangladesh. Shawkat Hossain, general secretary of VCPEAB, presented the keynote address on behalf of the association to share the policy reforms necessary to develop the venture capital and private equity industry. \"We can see our current policy has many drawbacks when compared to policies followed worldwide. From VCPEAB, we are proposing amendment and addition to our current structure to make an industry conducive to the creation of local startups,\" he said. Arif Khan, CEO of IDLC and member of VCPEAB, focused on widening investment opportunity and clearing policy with amendment to make the industry lucrative for investors. He emphasised many international practices followed worldwide, saying, \"There is a need to make the investment environment suitable for both local and foreign investors, outlining both the investment and exit strategies. This will create long-term investments feasible for the funds.\" Waliul Marrof Matin, director of VCPEAB and managing director of Maslin Capital Ltd, talked about the steps needed to create sustainability in the industry. He said, \"A few major guidelines are missing and creating barriers for us to invest properly.

{"title": "Dhaka calls for early FTA talks with EU to attract more investment", "body": "Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus today (1 February) called for an early start to Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the European Union, stressing the need for safeguarding Bangladesh's trade preferences in its largest export market once the current duty-free access expires in the coming years. The chief adviser made the remarks during a courtesy call by Nuria Lopez, chairperson of the European Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (EuroCham), at the State Guest House, Jamuna, in Dhaka. European Union Ambassador to Bangladesh Michael Miller took part in the meeting. During the discussion, they discussed the need to accelerate European investment in Bangladesh, how to ensure smooth trade relations between Bangladesh and the EU, and the need for further reforms to improve the country's business climate, said the Chief Adviser's press wing. They also discussed the upcoming elections and the deployment of international observers to monitor the polls. Yunus said the interim government has recently concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Japan, paving the way for duty-free access for more than 7,300 Bangladeshi products to the world's fourth-largest economy. He said that Bangladesh is preparing to hold similar negotiations with other countries, including the European Union, to ensure continued duty-free access for its products, particularly ready-made garments, to the EU market for the foreseeable future. \"The EPA with Japan has opened doors for us. It gives renewed hope to our export items. We definitely hope to sign an FTA with the EU to expand our market,\" the chief adviser said. EuroCham Chairperson Nuria Lopez said Bangladesh needs to begin FTA negotiations urgently, as the country may lose its existing trade preferences in the EU, its largest export destination, after graduating from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. She said that an FTA would attract more European investment to Bangladesh, create jobs and boost exports to advanced Western markets. Lopez pointed out that India is signing an FTA with the EU, while Vietnam already has such an agreement, allowing both middle-income countries preferential access to the European market. \"We are advocating for an FTA. I will go to Europe to encourage private companies to invest in Bangladesh,\" she said. EU Ambassador Michael Miller said that the commercial relationship with Bangladesh will evolve after graduation but not before 2029. He underlined the EU's strong interest to bring European investment and technology to the country, an important market with a population of nearly 200 million, and spoke about the EU readiness to organise an EU/Bangladesh Business Forum in 2026. \"We are looking for early political signals that EU companies will be encouraged to come and will enjoy a level playing field,\" he said. The chief adviser also emphasised the relocation of factories to Bangladesh, noting that European firms can take advantage of the country's large pool of skilled labour at competitive costs. \"We are building a free trade zone. Our aim is to turn Bangladesh into a manufacturing hub for global businesses. We want more European investment in Bangladesh,\" he said. Prof Yunus expressed satisfaction over the EU's decision to deploy a large contingent of election observers to Bangladesh for the upcoming general elections and referendum. \"It is important that EU election observers are here. It is a huge vote of confidence in revitalising our democracy,\" he said, adding that the overall picture of the election campaign was 'very positive'.

Bangladesh has floated the candidacy of its Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque for the post. Bangladesh sought the support during 'Eid Reunion' in honour of foreign diplomats hosted by Bangladesh Permanent Mission in New York on Tuesday. State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam said Bangladesh has emerged as a responsible state under the dynamic and pragmatic leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Referring to Bangladesh's long and deep involvement with international migration discourse, he said Bangladesh has floated candidacy of its Foreign Secretary for the position of DDG of IOM to continue the legacy, now at the operational level. He urged the representatives of member states to support Haque. The State Minister said Foreign Secretary Haque is the Special Envoy on Migration for Prime Minister Hasina and a professional diplomat who has worked for 12 years in IOM. \"If he gets the opportunity to work as a DDG IOM, then this experience can be used to make IOM a more effective organisation for better management of global migration,\" he said. The Eid reunion was organised at the Bangabandhu Auditorium of Permanent Mission of Bangladesh to the UN in honour of Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors of the member states of the UN. Foreign Secretary Haque was present in the event. The re-union turned into a friendly gathering of Permanent Representatives and diplomats of more than 100 countries including India, Japan, Russia, China, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, said a media release on Wednesday. In his opening remarks, Permanent Representative (PR) of Bangladesh to the UN Ambassador Masud Bin Momen requested fellow PRs to support Bangladesh's candidate. He also focused on various aspects of the remarkable development trajectory of Bangladesh and urged member states to play an effective role for a permanent solution to the Rohingya crisis. Haque made a presentation on the latest global situation on migration highlighting the need for effective migration governance for safe, orderly and regular migration. He also highlighted the various difficulties with regard to human mobility. Bangladesh Foreign Secretary said that he intends to utilise his long experience of working with IOM and dealing with migration issues for the welfare of the world. Showcasing the tremendous socio-economic development of Bangladesh, State Minister Alam also thanked the diplomats present for their support to Bangladesh's candidacy for ECOSOC election slated for June 14.

Williamson will depart the shortest format as his country's second-highest run-scorer, tallying 2,575 runs from 93 matches, including 18 half-centuries, at an average of 33.4. He captained New Zealand to the final of the 2021 T20 World Cup - where he scored 85 in a losing cause against Australia - and to semi-final appearances in 2016 and 2022. Williamson relinquished the captaincy in both white ball formats when signing a \"casual\" contract with NZ Cricket, allowing him to pick and choose his availability. Last week the 35-year-old confirmed he would be cutting back on his international commitments to focus more time on his young family and playing in professional white ball leagues. \"It's the right time for myself and the team. It gives the team clarity for the series moving forward and ahead of their next major focus which is the T20 World Cup,\" Williamson said in a statement. \"There's so much T20 talent there and the next period will be important to get cricket into these guys and get them ready for the World Cup.\" Williamson will miss the home T20 series against the West Indies starting on Wednesday and has also made himself unavailable for the subsequent ODI series. However, he will be available for three Tests against the tourists in December, where he will look to add to his New Zealand-record 9276 runs in the longest format. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Scott Weenink said Williamson had earned the right to determine how he plays out the rest of his international career. \"We've made it clear to Kane he has our full support as he reaches the back end of his illustrious career,\" Weenink said. \"We would, of course, love to see him play for as long as possible, but theres no doubt whenever he does decide to finally call time, he will go down as a legend of New Zealand cricket.\" Kane Williamson / T20 Cricket / retirement", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/new-zealand-great-williamson-retires-t20-internationals-1275121", "date": "2025-11-02T15:05:00+06:00", "author": "BSS 02 November, 2025, 03:05 pm Last modified: 02 November, 2025, 03:37 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 347, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:27:22.405831"}

Often the result stays undecided until the very final ball. But today's first semifinal of the Rising Stars Asia Cup between Bangladesh 'A' and India 'A', held at Doha's West End Park International Stadium, offered something even bigger. Bangladesh reached the final after defeating India in a super over. With 5 wickets in hand, India 'A' needed 16 runs in the final over. Bangladesh captain Akbar Ali gave the ball to Rakibul Hasan. On the third ball, Ashutosh Sharma hit Rakibul for a six, then struck a four off the next delivery. However, Zisan Alam dropped a straightforward catch at long-off. Rakib turned the match back in Bangladesh's favour by bowling Ashutosh on the fifth ball. Off the last delivery, Harsh Dubey pushed the ball to long-on and ran three. As Dubey was completing the second run, wicketkeeper Akbar Ali broke the off stump and ended up throwing an overthrow, allowing Dubey to take an extra run and tie the match. In the super over, India lost two wickets without scoring a run thanks to Ripon Mondol's fiery bowling. On the first ball, Ripon bowled Indian captain Jitesh Sharma. He dismissed Ashutosh Sharma on the next delivery to end India's innings. Even with just 1 run needed, the drama wasn't over. On the first ball, Yasir Ali Chowdhury Rabbi attempted a big shot off Suyash Sharma but was caught at long-on by Ramandeep Singh. Suyash then bowled a wide on the next ball, sending Bangladesh to the final. Chasing 195 runs, Vaibhav Suryavanshi's onslaught took India to 53 without loss in just 3.3 overs. Abdul Gaffar Sakline broke the stand by removing Suryavanshi on the fourth ball of the fourth over. Suryavanshi scored 38 off 15 balls with 2 fours and 4 sixes. As India's scoring rate slowed, they kept losing wickets. By 9.3 overs, Jitesh Sharma's India were 96 for 3. Jitesh and Nehal Wadhera added 52 runs for the fourth wicket. Bangladesh's slippery fielding also helped India stretch their innings that far. In the first semifinal of the Rising Stars Asia Cup, Indian captain Jitesh Sharma won the toss and chose to field. After being sent in to bat, Bangladesh were 144 for 6 after 18 overs. The Indian bowlers were punished in the final two overs. In the last 12 balls, Bangladesh did not lose a wicket. Jay (60) was trapped lbw by Irish leg-spinner Gavin Hoey. Mominul Haque then came in to bat. He and Sadman added 37 runs off 35 balls for the second wicket.

Blake Neff, who joined Tucker Carlson Tonight in 2017, resigned on July 10, reports BBC. It found that Neff regularly used highly offensive language on the online forum called AutoAdmit under the name CharlesXII. Fox News described the posts as \"horrendous and deeply offensive\". Mr Carlson is yet to comment. What did the posts say? There were many posts under the pseudonym including derogatory comments African-Americans, Asian-Americans and women. These included: \"Black doods staying inside playing Call of Duty is probably one of the biggest factors keeping crime down\" and \"honestly given how tired black people always claim to be, maybe the real crisis is their lack of sleep.\" He also maintained a thread harassing a woman and posted information about her personal life. The posts came to light after CNN received a tip-off that CharlesXII was in fact Mr Neff. They were able to identify him by matching up content in his messages with publicly available information about him.

With the launch of the new Go Ultra, the company has reimagined its signature miniature camera. The new one comes with a design and performance leap that could tempt both adventurers and everyday creators. Gone is the familiar pill-shaped look; the Go Ultra arrives with a rounded square body and an offset lens. It is slightly heavier than its predecessor, yet still far lighter than most action cameras on the market. Measuring only 1.8 inches per side, it remains pocket-sized but now houses a far larger 1/1.28-inch sensor. This is more than double the size of the Go 3's sensor and promises sharper, brighter footage, even in difficult light. The Go Ultra records at 4K/60fps, a major step up from the 30fps cap of the earlier Go 3. A new AI-powered PureVideo mode further enhances low-light shots. For those who enjoy slow motion, the camera can reach 240fps at 1080p. The improvements make it versatile enough for vlogging, sports or travel. Battery life also receives a boost. The built-in 500mAh battery allows up to 70 minutes of shooting, according to AndroidAuthority. Paired with the Action Pod, it stretches to 200 minutes. Fast charging means 80% power in just 12 minutes. Unlike previous models, the Go Ultra supports removable microSD cards up to 2TB, giving users flexibility without worrying about built-in storage limits. Priced at $450, or $500 with a Creator Bundle that includes mounts and a mini tripod, the Go Ultra is available in midnight black and arctic white. It is still waterproof to 33 feet depth, and its magnetic back and accessories make it wearable or mountable almost anywhere.

With shoppers still wary of catching the coronavirus at stores, retailers are leaving buying decisions to the last minute and planning on selling all-season basics such as men's chinos and t-shirts leftover from spring through into fall. \"We don't think orders for clothing will pick up anytime soon. Shipments could look up ahead of the Christmas but there is no guarantee,\" said Siddiqur Rahman, a Bangladeshi garment supplier to H&M (HMb.ST) and GAP Inc (GPS.N) among others. The destructive weight of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to contract the $2.5 trillion global fashion industry by up to 30% in 2020, according to investment bank Bryan, Garnier & Co. Nike (NKE.N) said it has already cancelled around 30% of its pre-pandemic factory orders for the autumn and end-of-year holiday season, while Sweden's H&M said it would sell some \"less seasonal\" spring stock through into autumn. Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein owner PVH (PVH.N) said last month it was being very cautious on buying for fall as it reported a drop in same-store sales of around a quarter for re-opened stores in North America. Ralph Lauren (RL.N) said it had cancelled around two-thirds of autumn season orders, while Levi Strauss & Co (LEVI.N) has said it would carry some unsold basic garments forward. Stores have opened in most of the United States and Europe, and while lines formed outside some, many consumers are staying at home, with almost 60% in the United States surveyed by Coresight Research on June 24 saying they were avoiding malls. A Morgan Stanley survey found that 57% of British consumers planned to stay away from clothing stores for fear of catching the coronavirus. The surge in online sales during the lockdown is not enough to compensate for the slump in traffic. Cancelled orders result in less work for factories across Asia where hundreds of thousands of garment workers have been laid off since the pandemic struck. New orders are down by as much as 45% on the year, said Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, and factories in the world's second-largest garment maker are operating at around half their capacity in the country. With consumers wary of returning to stores, retailers are holding out to the last moment to put in orders with suppliers as they try to gauge demand at a time when traditional back-to-school spending plans are up in the air. \"We need to wait as long as we can with purchases - to take the decisions as near the sales moment as possible,\" H&M Chief Executive Helena Helmersson told Reuters, after the retailer reported its first quarterly loss in decades last month. Recruiters for garment companies in Vietnam, a major manufacturer for big sportswear labels such as Nike and Adidas (ADSGn.DE), are feeling the pain.

Those plants were later used as firewood. Because of the constant fear of river erosion, farmers avoided cultivating crops on the char areas. But now, a variety of crops are being grown on 43 chars of the Padma River. Land that was once fallow or used for grazing is now producing a wide range of crops. Farmers from the Charghat char areas take their produce directly to Baneshwar Bazar, about 10 kilometres away, where they mainly sell their crops at wholesale prices. From Baneshwar, the produce grown on these fertile chars is distributed to different parts of the country. Farmers say that although farming on the chars is somewhat challenging, it plays a central role in improving their livelihoods. The soil of the chars is no longer left fallow. By cultivating crops here, farmers are becoming economically stable. Asked whether the fear of river erosion still affects farming in the char areas, farmer Mukhtar Ali said, \"Whether we farm or not, the char will eventually be taken by the river. So, since we also have to survive, we have been cultivating the chars for the past few years, putting all fears aside. When the river takes the land, it will take it — that is a matter of fate.\" However, various challenges remain in the char areas, including transport and electricity. Farmers say that if government support increases in these areas, even more significant changes could take place in agriculture there. During visits to several chars, it was evident that a wide variety of crops are being cultivated across vast stretches of land. From fruits and vegetables to spices, farmers are growing crops of their choice. In fact, char agriculture has embraced modern techniques, with land now being cultivated using power tillers and tractors. We spoke to one farmer named Kazi Sirajul. He said that he is cultivating nearly four bighas of land on a newly emerged char through lease. \"Every year I lease some char land and cultivate it. This year, I am doing the same. On these four bighas, I have planted onions, garlic, lentils, and khesari. The lentil crop has not been very good, but the other crops are doing fairly well. I am hopeful that they will bring me a good return.\" Speaking about the challenges of farming in the char areas, he said that transport and electricity are major issues. \"Although electricity is now reaching some chars, irrigation facilities in these areas are still not on par with those in regular agricultural land. If these problems are addressed, the hardships faced by farmers cultivating the chars will be significantly reduced.\" Currently, around 20 types of crops are produced annually on these chars, contributing to a more vibrant local economy. In the char areas of Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, and Natore districts, rice, onions, groundnuts, and maize are being cultivated on a large scale. On char land, it is now possible to grow crops three times a year, which is helping to increase farmers' incomes. According to reliable sources, a project undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture is operating on 18 chars in Rajshahi district, five chars in Lalpur upazila of Natore, and 20 chars in Sadar and Shibganj upazilas of Chapainawabganj. The total agricultural land across these chars is 17,023 hectares. As a result of the project, land has increased by 431 hectares across the 43 chars. Crop production has also risen. Where 10 to 12 types of crops were once cultivated, now 20 types of crops are being grown. According to sources at the Rajshahi divisional Department of Agricultural Extension, the project is running in Paba, Godagari, and Bagha upazilas of Rajshahi district. The chars under Paba upazila are Char Khidirpur, Char Majhardiar, Haripur, and Alimganj. Under Bagha upazila, they are Kaldeskhali, Dadpur, Palashi Fatepur, Barshadiar, Gaopara, Fatepur Palashi, and Mashidpur. Under Godagari upazila, they include Char Ashariyadah, Matikata, Rajabari, Gogram, and the municipality area. The number of beneficiary farmers across these chars exceeds 15,000. Deputy Director of the Department of Agricultural Extension, Mosammat Sabina Begum, said, \"In the char areas, many farmers' fortunes have changed through cash crops. We are continuing to work with them through various project-based initiatives, including providing advice.\" She added that the agriculture department will continue working to resolve any problems faced by the farmers. At one time, boro rice, mashkalai, lentils, wheat, mustard, rai mustard, khesari, jute, sesame, coriander, tomato, aubergine, peas, mango, chili, onion, sweet potato, and maize were cultivated on these chars. Currently, black cumin, pointed gourd, groundnut, maize, sweet pumpkin, jute, boro rice, peas, cabbage, cauliflower, watermelon, melon, cucumber, and garlic are being cultivated. Farmer Shafiqul Alam from one such char said that earlier, only a few crops were produced on char land. \"Now, along with cauliflower and cabbage, black cumin, watermelon, melon, and cucumber are being cultivated. Cultivation costs are comparatively low on char land, and yields are good.\" Local residents said that char areas benefit from silt-rich soil, which requires less fertilizer. However, installing small irrigation pumps would make farming more convenient and further strengthen the char economy. Boats remain the only means of communication, and for agriculture and other goods, they are the sole mode of transport. Pesticide traders in the char areas noted that char crops require less fertilizer. While crops on other land may need fertilization three times, char crops often require it only once. As a result, farmers save significantly on fertilizer costs. Another farmer, Abdul Qader, said that extensive livestock rearing takes place on the chars. \"Every household on the char has livestock. Straw from crops produced on the chars is used as animal feed. Mangoes and various other fruits and crops are being produced on char land. In addition, with advice from agricultural officers, new crops are being cultivated on the chars.\" Regarding this, Rajshahi district livestock officer Dr Md Atowar Rahman said that livestock rearing on the chars has increased compared to the past. \"Although the health of char livestock is not intensive, it is good. These animals are not artificially fattened. Livestock rearing on the chars is playing a major role in the economy. In the future, livestock rearing on the chars will increase further.\" Bagha upazila agriculture officer Md Shafiullah Sultan said that among the char areas of Rajshahi, Bagha produces the highest amount of fruits and crops. \"Compared to other land, crop production costs are lower on char land, and yields are better. A new char has emerged in Bagha, and we will bring that char under cultivation.\" He added that cultivable land on the chars has increased compared to the past. \"At one time, five to six types of crops were cultivated on char land. Now, more crops are being produced. Char areas are playing a major role in agriculture and the economy.\" During the previous government's tenure, a project was undertaken to bring char land under cultivation. Additional director of the Rajshahi divisional Department of Agricultural Extension, Dr Md Azizur Rahman, said that this project is ongoing in Rajshahi, Natore and Chapainawabganj. \"The amount of agricultural land in char areas has increased after the project was launched. At the same time, the production of various crops has increased. The project's goals are to ensure food security, meet national nutritional demand, increase cropping intensity on the chars, expand modern technology, diversify crops and increase agricultural commercialisation through expanded cultivation.\" Rajshahi regional director of the Department of Agricultural Extension, Sirajul Islam, said that cultivation in the char areas of Rajshahi is increasing every year. \"Chars that submerge annually accumulate silt, and silt is extremely beneficial for land. Crops grown on silt-mixed soil are of good quality.\" However, he noted that in some char areas, harmful medicines commonly used in neighbouring India are applied. These medicines are used to control pests, but crops grown using them are harmful to health. Such instances, he said, are rare. He added that field-level workers have been instructed to encourage char farmers and resolve their problems. \"Through various programmes, their issues are addressed. Farmers in the char areas are also benefiting from the government's farmer-friendly initiatives. They are playing an important role in national production.\"", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/panorama/padma-river-chars-witness-farming-revolution-multicropping-1343396", "date": "2026-01-25T17:30:00+06:00", "author": "Hasan Jamilur Rahman Saikat 25 January, 2026, 05:30 pm Last modified: 25 January, 2026, 06:23 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1404, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:27:32.852012"}

The announcement was made at Google's cloud unit's annual customer and partner conference, which has been turned into a virtual gathering over several weeks because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Google has been trying for more than a decade to catch up with Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Office, which dominates the global market for corporate email and document-editing tools. Both companies have been adding video-calling features and other collaboration tools to attract new business from companies operating from home during the pandemic. Google contends it has found an edge with potential customers by promoting Gmail as a single hub for workers to access text chats, video calls and now documents. Microsoft has limited tie-ins between its email and chat tools, Outlook and Teams. \"Microsoft is still telling you there's two separate places to check, two different habits, two inboxes to look at,\" Javier Soltero, a Google vice president who used to work for Microsoft, said in an interview on Wednesday. \"They are not incentivized to do a deep integration between Teams and Outlook,\" Soltero said, without elaborating. Consumers using the free version of Gmail may have access to the new integrations in the future, Soltero said. Microsoft, which has continued to post fast Office revenue growth, declined to comment.

{"title": "Mbappe and Bellingham strike as Real Madrid edge Barcelona 2-1 in fiery El Clasico", "body": "Goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham earned Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Barcelona in a spiky El Clasico on Sunday that snapped a four-match losing streak against their rivals and extended their lead atop the LaLiga standings. Mbappe opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a close-range finish after a perfectly timed through ball from Bellingham. However, Barcelona capitalised on a mistake by Arda Guler to equalise in the 38th minute through Fermin Lopez. Real regained the lead five minutes later when Bellingham tapped in from inside the six-yard box following an inspired run and cross by Vinicius Jr. Real had several chances but were denied by an excellent display from Barca keeper Wojciech Szczesny, who kept out Mbappe's penalty early in the second half. Barcelona barely threatened Real keeper Thibaut Courtois after the break and finished the match with 10 men after midfielder Pedri earned a second yellow card for a sliding tackle from behind on Aurelien Tchouameni in added time. The closing stages were marked by drama as Vinicius Jr reacted angrily to being substituted by manager Alonso, storming down the tunnel before returning to the bench. The Brazilian was later involved in a heated exchange between players from both sides, prompting Spanish police to intervene and prevent a full-scale brawl. Real moved to 27 points at the top of the LaLiga standings, five ahead of Barcelona in second. After four consecutive defeats to Barcelona across three competitions, Real Madrid entered the match like a team that was desperately in need of a statement win to validate the project of new manager Xabi Alonso. \"I'm very happy for the lads. They needed this feeling of winning a big match,\" Alonso told reporters. \"We know it's still October and it's early days, that we have a lot of work to do. But we wanted to feel good about ourselves, and that's how it's been. We need a lot of what we've seen today.\" Roared on by a sold-out Santiago Bernabeu crowd, Real cornered Barcelona in a match that started with referee Cesar Soto Grado overturning a penalty for the home side following a VAR review. The official ruled that Vinicius Jr had kicked Lamine Yamal's leg while attempting a shot, reversing his initial decision. But it was not the first call that left the Real Madrid players and coach fuming. A few minutes later Mbappe had a stunning long-range strike ruled out for offside, despite replays suggesting Barcelona's Lopez may have been the last to touch the ball. Real Madrid kept piling on the pressure, dominating proceedings with over 75% of possession in the first half-hour. But they were frustrated by Szczesny, who made some remarkable saves to deny Mbappe, Dean Huijsen and Vinicius Jr from close range. Their persistence paid off when Mbappe latched onto Bellingham's through ball and slotted home to break the deadlock, but Barcelona equalised against the run of play following Guler's mistake. Vinicius Jr tormented Barcelona's defence as he created Real's second goal, breezing past Frenkie De Jong and Jules Kounde on the left wing before delivering a cross that Eder Militao headed back into the path of Bellingham, who tapped into an empty net in the 43rd minute. Real had several chances to extend their lead early in the second half, including a penalty awarded for Eric Garcia's handball. However, Szczesny, Barcelona's standout performer, denied Mbappe with a superb one-handed save, adding to his string of crucial interventions that kept the visitors in the game. Despite enjoying more possession in the final 30 minutes, Barcelona lacked creativity in attack and failed to trouble Courtois while their frustrations were compounded when Pedri received a second yellow card. \"In the first half, we weren't quite sharp enough with the ball, and that's where they're very dangerous,\" De Jong told DAZN. \"In the second half, we controlled the game, but we struggled to create dangerous chances.\" Real Madrid vs FC Barcelona / El Clasico", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/mbappe-and-bellingham-strike-real-madrid-edge-barcelona-2-1-fiery-el-clasico-1270711", "date": "2025-10-27T00:50:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 27 October, 2025, 12:50 am Last modified: 27 October, 2025, 07:56 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 661, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:27:39.238675"}

{"title": "How NotebookLM became my favourite study buddy", "body": "As someone juggling research, reading, and writing deadlines, I often find myself buried under academic PDFs and notes I can barely remember naming. So when I first heard of Google's NotebookLM, I thought it might be another flashy AI tool making big promises. I already had ChatGPT and Gemini to help me analyse documents – why try something new? But after putting it through a real test – uploading one of the most influential economics papers of all time, authored by three Nobel laureates, \"The colonial origins of comparative development\" – I discovered that NotebookLM is not just useful. It is genuinely empowering. Here is what I found after using NotebookLM as a student – and why it might become your best friend for classes, papers, and everything in between. So, what is NotebookLM? NotebookLM is a research and note-taking tool powered by Google's Gemini AI. Unlike general chatbots, it is designed to work only with the documents you upload. This means it does not pull information from across the internet. Instead, it helps you make sense of your own materials – which, in my case, was this long economics paper. I began by uploading the PDF to NotebookLM and was surprised at how simple the setup was. No complicated onboarding. Just a \"Create notebook\" button, followed by uploading your files. Within seconds, the paper was fully integrated into a searchable, interactive workspace. You can organise notebooks by course, project, or topic – a blessing for those of us dealing with multiple overlapping deadlines. NotebookLM accepts up to 50 documents in one notebook, which is far more than Gemini's 10-document limit for uploads. That alone gave me room to breathe. Here is where NotebookLM won me over. Instead of skimming through a 33-page economics paper trying to recall which section had the argument about settler mortality and institutions, I simply typed a question: \"What is the main hypothesis of the paper?\" NotebookLM returned a crisp summary: the authors argue that colonialism shaped institutions, and those institutions continue to influence development outcomes today. What impressed me more was the clarity of the response. It was accurate, direct, and referenced the right part of the document. That changed how I interact with my reading list. It was not just about summarising like ChatGPT or Gemini do – it felt like having a knowledgeable study partner who had read every page more closely than I ever could. One of my favourite features is the ability to generate study guides or briefing documents with a single click. After uploading the paper, I asked NotebookLM to create a study guide, for which there is a separate button which takes just a single click. It produced a clear outline – including possible quiz questions with answer keys, essay format questions, and glossaries – all sourced directly from the document. Did I mention that the tool supports over 50 languages — including Bangla? It does. When I switched the output language to Bangla, it delivered a surprisingly solid summary of the findings. It was not quite as sharp or nuanced as the English version, but still accurate and easy to follow. For anyone preparing for an exam, this is gold. The summary gave me just enough to grasp the key arguments without overwhelming me. It is the kind of scaffolding that helps build deeper understanding. While many AI tools spit out answers in the same voice, NotebookLM lets you customise tone and length. You can ask for a detailed analysis, a short answer, or even a guide in a specific tone – professional, informal, or even tailored for beginners. These options are available in the premium version, but even the free plan offers more than enough. For instance, I asked for a simplified version of the central thesis as if explaining to someone with no background in economics. The result? A friendly, easy-to-understand explanation, yet still rooted in the original document. I admit, I was sceptical about the audio overviews. I had tried AI-generated voices before and they sounded like robots with sore throats. But the NotebookLM's version surprised me. Two hosts – one male, one female – summarise your uploaded content in a podcast-style conversation. They adapt their tone based on the topic. In my case, they sounded thoughtful and engaged as they discussed institutional development and colonial history. The podcast it provided me was about 30-minutes long, and in English – but I decided to give it a twist – to try it in Bangla as well. When I opted for an audio overview in Bangla, it provided me with a 10-minutes long podcast – two hosts – similar to the English one – discussing the core ideas of the paper. The speech was not entirely natural, but I was convinced enough to call it a podcast. While it will not replace your favourite podcast, it offers a different way to absorb dense content. I found it particularly useful when I was stuck in Dhaka's notorious traffic – of course with a pair of noise cancelling headphones – reviewing key ideas without reading a single word. Of course, NotebookLM is not perfect. Sometimes it misses nuance in arguments or oversimplifies. It is also not ideal for heavily mathematical content or tables. You need to be careful not to always take its outputs at face value without checking the source material. But as a study assistant, it gets you 80 percent of the way there – and does so in a fraction of the time. After spending time with NotebookLM, I can safely say this: it is the AI tool I did not know I needed. It made one of the most complex academic texts I have ever read more accessible. And that is what university-going students need – not magic, not fluff, just tools that remove friction from learning. Whether you are working on your thesis, preparing for a debate, or just trying to understand a particularly dense article, NotebookLM gives you an edge. And for now, it remains free to use – both on the web and through its Android and iOS apps. If you are a student reading this and feeling overwhelmed by your workload, try uploading just one paper, or a chapter from your textbooks you find intimidating. Let NotebookLM break it down, talk you through it, or summarise the key bits. Like me, you might find yourself wondering how you ever studied without it.

{"title": "IPL broadcast suspended in Bangladesh as Dhaka-Delhi tension snowballs", "body": "The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has suspended the broadcast of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in Bangladesh, following the exclusion of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the tournament's team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). The ministry issued a letter to the relevant broadcasters today (5 January), instructing them not to telecast the matches. The decision comes in the aftermath of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur's removal from the Kolkata Knight Riders squad following directives from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The letter added that no reasonable explanation has been provided for the Indian cricket board's decision, which has deeply hurt and angered the people of Bangladesh. In view of the situation, the ministry instructed the chief executives of all relevant television channels in Bangladesh not to broadcast IPL matches and related programmes until further notice. Bangladesh has also officially decided not to travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup, escalating the sporting standoff between the two countries to an unprecedented level. Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul disclosed the major development yesterday, calling the move a necessary response to what he termed the \"radical communal policy\" of the Indian cricket authorities. KKR release Mustafizur as Shah Rukh Khan faces backlash from India's BJP, religious leaders When asked about the matter, BCB Director Khaled Mashud Pilot told The Business Standard yesterday, \"We have sent a letter to the ICC requesting that our match be moved from India to Sri Lanka. \"If they [India] cannot provide security to one of our players, how will they ensure the security of our entire team? That is why we will not go there to play.\" Since Mustafizur was dropped by KKR following a directive of the BCCI, concerns over the safety of Bangladesh's cricketers at the World Cup have come to the forefront. The 10th edition of the T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, begins on 7 February. Bangladesh was scheduled to face the West Indies in their opening match at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Drawn in Group C, Bangladesh will also compete against defending champions England, Italy and Nepal. While the schedule currently lists three group matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai, the BCB discussed a venue change to Sri Lanka, citing security concerns. Ultimately, it decided to send a letter to the ICC requesting a change of venue. Kolkata Knight Riders officially confirmed on 3 January that Mustafizur has been released from the squad ahead of the upcoming IPL, scheduled to be held from March to May this year. KKR had secured Mustafizur's services for Rs9.2 crore after an intense bidding war with Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals at the players' mini-auction held last month. The franchise shared the update through a press statement, stating that the decision was taken following instructions from the IPL governing body, BCCI. Mustafizur's signing had earlier triggered sharp reactions from Hindu religious leaders and politicians in India, many of whom targeted KKR owner Shah Rukh Khan after the franchise acquired the Bangladeshi pacer amid tensions between India and Bangladesh. Dhaka-Delhi tensions Relations between Bangladesh and India have come under severe strain following the August 2024 ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ending what New Delhi had described as a \"golden era\" (shonali adhyay) of bilateral cooperation, according to analysts and diplomatic sources. The deterioration marks a sharp reversal after more than a decade of close security, economic and political alignment between the neighbours, and has raised concerns on both sides about trade, border security and regional geopolitics, says a report published by the International Crisis Group. Since an interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus took power, relations have been marked by public disputes and retaliatory measures. Dhaka has criticised sections of Indian media for overstating attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh, saying political and economic disputes were often portrayed as religious violence. Some Hindu community leaders in Bangladesh have warned that such coverage has increased insecurity. India sharply reduced visa issuances following Hasina's departure, cutting daily approvals from about 8,000 to roughly 1,000, according to officials, affecting medical travel and education. Both countries summoned each other's envoys following a series of issues in recent months. On 22 December, Bangladesh suspended visa and consular services for Bangladesh nationals and applicants in India's New Delhi, Siliguri and Agartala. The development came following protests by Hindu nationalist groups, prompting suspensions reportedly on security grounds. On 20 December, Hindutva outfits Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal staged demonstrations over the lynching of Dipu Chandra Das, a garment worker in Mymensingh, outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi. Bangladesh said the protests outside the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi left the high commissioner and his family feeling threatened. Earlier on 19 December, a group of protesters attacked the residence of India's assistant high commissioner in Chattogram following the news of Inqilab Mancha leader Sharif Osman Hadi's death spread and enraged the student-people.

The Florida Department of Health (DOH) has issued a warning to residents of Hillsborough County on July 3 after one person in the area had contracted Naegleria fowleri, reports BBC. The microscopic, single-celled amoeba can cause an infection of the brain, and is usually fatal. Commonly found in warm freshwater, the amoeba enters the body through the nose. The DOH did not outline where the infection was contracted, or the patient's condition. The amoeba cannot be passed from person to person. Infections are typically seen in southern US states. They are rare in Florida, where only 37 cases have been reported since 1962. Health officials urged locals to avoid nasal contact with water from taps and other sources. This includes bodies of open water such as lakes, rivers, ponds and canals, where infections are more likely in the warmer summer months of July, August and September. Those infected with Naegleria fowleri have symptoms including fever, nausea and vomiting, as well as a stiff neck and headaches. Most die within a week. The DOH has urged people who experience those symptoms to \"seek medical attention right away, as the disease progresses rapidly\". \"Remember, this disease is rare and effective prevention strategies can allow for a safe and relaxing summer swim season,\" the DOH said. Naegleria fowleri infections are rare in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Between 2009 and 2018, only 34 infections were reported in the country. Of those cases, 30 people were infected by recreational water, three after performing nasal irrigation with contaminated tap water, and one person was infected by contaminated tap water used on a backyard slip-n-slide, the CDC said. brain-eating amoeba / US / Florida", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/rare-brain-eating-amoeba-case-found-florida-102349", "date": "2020-07-06T10:05:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 06 July, 2020, 10:05 am Last modified: 06 July, 2020, 02:27 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 303, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:27:52.278084"}

The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has suspended contracts with around 1,800 foreign Umrah travel agencies, nearly one-third of the approximately 5,800 agencies operating in the sector. The move followed a performance review that found shortcomings in service quality and non-compliance with approved standards, says Arab News. The affected agencies have been given a 10-day grace period to rectify their status and meet classification requirements in order to have their contracts reinstated. The suspension applies only to the issuance of new visas, while pilgrims who already hold valid visas or confirmed reservations will continue to receive services as planned. The ministry said the measure is intended to protect the rights of Umrah performers and ensure reliable and continuous services. Separately, Saudi Arabia's National Center for Wildlife announced the conclusion of the 2025–2026 hunting season on 31 January. The season, which began in September 2025, was regulated under updated mechanisms based on research and international best practices. Authorities said the framework was designed to support the sustainable use of natural resources and maintain ecological balance in line with the Kingdom's Environmental Law. In sports developments, Spain's Carlos Alcaraz defeated Serbia's Novak Djokovic to win his first Australian Open title.

The first Test is scheduled to begin on July 8 at the Ageas Bowl and Root will leave England's training camp on Wednesday to be with his wife, Carrie, who is expecting their second child later this week. Root will also miss England's three-day warm-up match that begins on Wednesday.

{"title": "Suspicious transactions decrease by 8% in FY19", "body": "Banks, financial institutions and other reporting organisations sent a significant number of suspicious transaction and activity reports to the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) in fiscal year 2018-19, though the number is lower than the previous year. In 2018-19, the BFIU received a total of 3,573 suspicious transaction reports (STRs) and suspicious activity reports (SARs) from reporting agencies, down by 7.86 percent year-on-year, according to the BFIU's annual report released on Sunday. Bankers said it was a good sign that the banks and other reporting agencies concerned had paid more attention to the suspicious transactions and activities as part of their fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. The quality of STRs and SARs submitted by reporting agencies also improved, said Abu Hena Mohd Razee Hassan, chief of the BFIU. The BFIU is responsible for analysing STRs, SARs, cash transaction reports, plus information related to money laundering and terrorist financing received from reporting agencies and other sources. In FY19, the BFIU disseminated only 52 STRs and SARs to different investigation and law enforcement agencies – in contrast to 677 the previous year, according to the report. The BFIU initially analyses and investigates the complaints submitted by reporting agencies. If any anomaly is found, it forwards the reports to the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh police and other government agencies for further investigation, Hassan said. He said the BFIU in FY18 forwarded 609 digital hundi and informal remittances cases to government investigation agencies – the majority of STRs and SARs. The reporting agencies – banks, non-bank financial institutions, money changers and capital market intermediaries – have lodged 5,036 suspicious transactions worth Tk1.021 crore in FY19. The global community always accepts the rise in STRs and SARs positively as they think that this is an indication of the financial organisations' compliance with corporate governance, said Hassan, also a former deputy governor of the central bank. For instance, American financial organisations make roughly 55,000 STRs and SARs per day, he said. Banks face heavy penalties if they do not forward the STRs and SARs on time, said Syed Mahbubur Rahman, former chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh, a platform of private banks' chief executives. The high number of reports indicates that banks and other reporting agencies are now more concerned about money laundering and terrorist financing, said Rahman, also the chief executive of Mutual Trust Bank. BFIU has disseminated 10 terrorism and terrorism financing cases in the year 2018-19. As part of the analysis, the BFIU scrutinised 42 accounts and 27 of those have been frozen for varying periods of time.

{"title": "Captains’ captain: Bashar’s best Steve Waugh", "body": "He is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest cricketers to lead Bangladesh. He led from the front and was pretty successful with the bat across formats. He scored as many as 38 half centuries, three hundreds to go with that. That's why Habibul Bashar is fondly called 'Mr. Fifty'. Bashar led the side from 2004 to 2007. Bangladesh won their first Test match under the leadership of Bashar. He captained the side in 29 victories in ODIs as well. In the fourth episode of The Business Standard's (TBS) captains' captain series, Habibul Bashar talked about his favourite leader and different aspects of captaincy. In Bashar's words I've played under quite a few captains. Everyone had their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, we used to hear that Durjoy (Naimur Rahman) would captain the national team from childhood. Pilot (Khaled Mashud) was very passionate. Akram bhai (Akram Khan) and Bulbul bhai (Aminul Islam) were also brilliant. Sujon bhai (Khaled Mahmud) was an excellent captain, especially off the field. But among the captains I have played under, I feel Faruk Ahmed was the best. Faruk bhai was brilliant both on and off the field. He used to read the situation of a match really well. He knew the capabilities of the players thoroughly and knew their limitations as well. I played under Nannu bhai (Minhajul Abedin) for a year too. But I rate Faruk Ahmed very highly as a leader. It's difficult to pick one if I am asked to name my favourite captain. I feel Steve Waugh was a very charismatic captain. You may say that Waugh had a star-studded team which made his job easier. But I very well know how difficult it is to maintain such a stellar team. It's not as difficult to maintain a team with players who have limited capabilities. But it's really tough to keep players of incredible calibre always motivated on and off the field. That's the reason why I like Steve Waugh the most. He was completely a different person off the field. On the field, he was extremely aggressive and didn't even give away a single easy run. But off the field he was very friendly. But I had never tried to copy anyone's style while captaining. It's always better to do what you think is appropriate for your team as a captain. I got advice from many people. I always listened to everyone carefully and tried to take the positives out of them. But at the end of the day, it was I who had to lead the side and I followed my own philosophy. For example, I noticed Steve Waugh to support his teammates no matter what. He scolded them on the field but he never backed away from supporting them. That's one quality I always tried to acquire. When Sourav Ganguly became the Indian captain, he had to handle so many superstars and legends of the game. It took immense courage to do so, being a Bengal boy. But he never gave up. That's a quality all the captains need to have. I always remained honest to myself, to my teammates and to the game. No matter what, the team always came first to me. If you can gain the trust of your teammates, your job becomes easier. That's what I always tried to do as a captain.

{"title": "JABA: A taste of the Garo hills", "body": "The most unassuming of places sometimes harbour delightful adventures. Farmgate, the heart of Dhaka, is home to bus stops that will take you to almost any part of the city, crowded with university admission coaching centres and local eateries we would rarely step into willingly. Yet tucked away here is one such hidden gem of a restaurant. On the second floor of the rather unwelcoming Green Supermarket — occupied mainly by sanitaryware shops and doctors' and dentists' chambers — you will stumble upon a tiny slice of Bangladesh's northern Garo Hills. Called JABA, the restaurant is the brainchild of Sumon Nongmin, who embarked on this culinary journey in January 2019. Despite having no formal culinary training, Sumon set out to represent his Garo heritage by offering diners an authentic cultural experience through food. \"Garo culture is mostly celebrated in literature, art, or through our handicrafts. I wanted to truly bring the taste of the Garo Hills to Dhaka,\" said the owner. With the support of a dedicated team of family members and friends, JABA began its journey, delighting diners with mouthwatering delicacies that many of us had never encountered before. JABA is unapologetically itself, welcoming you with its signature amra juice. As you settle into one of the comfortable cane chairs, surrounded by earthen plates and cups, bamboo trays, and artefacts lining the shelves, the gentle aroma of greenery and spices wafts through the room. Garo artwork and cultural items grace the walls, while warm lighting enhances the ambience. \"Mom-and-pop\" is perhaps the best way to describe this place, as it showcases the underrepresented native cuisine of the northern hills of Bangladesh. What makes JABA truly distinctive in a city dominated by global and Dhakaiya cuisines is its commitment to authenticity. Garo food has its own distinct flavours, and the JABA team ensures this by sourcing most of their ingredients directly from the hills. \"80% of the ingredients we use are sourced fresh from the hills, while some widely available items come from local markets,\" Sumon added. Their cooking philosophy is refreshingly simple: dishes are either steamed or slow-cooked, with minimal use of oil and spices. This allows the true flavours to shine through. The food is light on the palate, clean, and free from any hint of oiliness — resulting in a meal that is both satisfying and gentle on the stomach. Ingredients such as nappi, papaya flowers, and snails — unfamiliar to the Bangali palate — are transformed into delicious delicacies by the JABA kitchen. The welcome drink made from amra cleanses the palate and signals to your taste buds that something truly special lies ahead. The first dish we tried was Chicken Mungdi, which surprised me, as it is possibly the only noodle dish that originated in Bangladesh. While noodles are most commonly associated with East Asian cuisines, Bangladesh has its own version known as mungdi. This dish feels like a warm blanket on a cold winter night: a clear, aromatic broth with chewy noodles, topped with savoury chicken, fresh coriander, crisp onions, and a sprinkle of dried chilli flakes and shrimp. It is soul food at its best — simple yet deeply comforting — proving how humble ingredients can be transformed into a hearty meal. Next came Chicken Laksu, a dish I was previously unfamiliar with. Bite-sized pieces of fried, bone-in chicken are pounded with onions and green chillies, finished with a dash of lemon juice. Served cold and best paired with steaming hot rice, the dish is refreshingly tangy, with the sharpness of lemon and onions cutting through the richness of the chicken, presented in a way I had never experienced before. The river fish dish was another homage to the simplicity of rural cuisine. Small whole fish are lightly marinated, gently seasoned, and then shallow-fried. The head and skin are delightfully crunchy, while the flesh remains succulent, best enjoyed with the accompanying green chilli mash. For someone accustomed to either deep-fried fish or maachher torkari with potatoes and tomatoes, this preparation felt unique and honest — a rustic celebration of the bounty our rivers offer. And how can a Bangladeshi meal end without dessert? The Binni Pitha was simple yet charming. Wrapped in leaves that reveal a piping hot pitha upon unravelling, it is made from fragrant binni rice mixed with coconut shavings. Slightly burnt on the outside for a pleasant crunch, it gives way to a soft, buttery interior. Lightly sweet, it is a dessert that appeals to diners of all ages. In a city where local cuisines are steadily losing their identity amid fierce competition from global flavours, JABA sits quietly, ready to welcome diners with its humble yet delicious offerings. It celebrates the unique flavours of the Garo Hills and makes them accessible to Dhaka's food lovers. When asked about future plans, Sumon Nongmin smiled and said, \"Maybe not now — we want to focus on quality and ensure our current clientele is satisfied.\" This emphasis on quality over expansion speaks volumes about the sincerity behind JABA. JABA is an invitation to connect with Garo culture, heritage, and legacy. If you are seeking to discover a new cuisine, visit JABA at least once. Sit in the cosy eatery and let the food transport you to the hills of northern Bangladesh. They are open seven days a week from 11am to 11pm and offer online delivery via Facebook, Pathao and Foodi.

{"title": "Ctg Port strike suspended for 2 days, workers to resume work tomorrow", "body": "The labour leaders at Chattogram Port have announced a two-day suspension of the ongoing strike, following negotiations with Shipping Adviser Brig Gen (retd) M Sakhawat Hossain. The announcement was made by Humayun Kabir and Ibrahim Khokon, coordinators of the Bandar Rokkha Sangram Oikya Parishad, at a press conference at Bandar Bhaban this afternoon (5 February). Workers are expected to return to work tomorrow morning. However, the labour leaders warned that they would resume protests from Sunday if the New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT) agreement is not withdrawn. Ibrahim Khokon said the labour leaders presented four demands during the meeting, including the cancellation of the NCT agreement. The shipping adviser assured them that he would discuss the matter with the chief adviser and provide a response within two days, he added. \"Our other demands were the withdrawal of transfer orders for employees, no legal action against workers who led the movement, and the removal of the port authority chairman,\" Khokon said. He further said that the adviser accepted two of the demands and promised to consider the issue of the chairman's removal. Humayun Kabir said the strike was postponed out of respect for the holy month of Ramadan and based on assurances from the adviser.

{"title": "Captaincy responsibility won't add any pressure: Liton Das", "body": "Liton Das insisted that taking over the captaincy of Rangpur Riders will not add any extra pressure on him, despite his modest form in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). His comments came after Rangpur appointed Liton as captain for the remainder of the tournament, replacing Nurul Hasan Sohan. Sohan voluntarily stepped down from the role to focus on his batting after a lean run of form that saw him score just 30 runs in eight matches. Liton, the regular Bangladesh T20I captain, had featured only as a batter for Rangpur so far this season. He has scored 162 runs in eight matches, a stat that falls short of his reputation and ability. \"The expectations I have of myself, and the expectations everyone else has, I haven't fully met them yet,\" Liton told reporters today (16 January). \"But there has never been a lack of effort. I will try to overcome that and contribute something good for Rangpur,\" he added. Downplaying the added responsibility, Liton said captaincy would not affect his batting approach. \"Whenever I have played as a batsman, I have always tried to give 100 per cent,\" he said. \"I know there will be more responsibility as a captain. But when I bat, I think of myself as a batter first, whose primary job is to score runs.\" Despite being tipped as one of the most formidable sides of this BPL, Rangpur are yet to mathematically secure a playoff berth, while three other teams have already qualified. However, their progression to the knockout stage appears highly likely. Rangpur have won four of their eight matches and currently sit fourth on the points table with eight points. Their nearest challengers, Dhaka Capitals and Noakhali, have each won two of their four matches. \"Cricket is played on the field. On paper, they are just names,\" Liton said, adding that performance is the only thing that matters most. \"It depends on how successful you are against the opposition on a given day and how smartly you play your cricket.

{"title": "China releases professor who criticised President Xi, friends say", "body": "A Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party was released on Sunday after six days of detention, his friends said. Xu Zhangrun, a constitutional law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, returned home on Sunday morning but remained under surveillance and was not free to speak publicly about what happened, one of his friends, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. Calls to the media departments of the Beijing police and Tsinghua University seeking comment went unanswered on Sunday. Xu, 57, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader, which will allow Xi to remain in office beyond his current second term. According to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters, he was taken from his house in suburban Beijing on Monday morning by more than 20 policemen, who searched his house and confiscated his computer. According to Xu's friends, police told his wife that he was being detained for allegedly soliciting prostitution during a trip to Chengdu, but at least two friends dismissed that allegation as character assassination. Since the 2018 article, Xu has written other critiques of the party. At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, he wrote an article calling for freedom of speech. Most recently in May, before China's delayed annual parliamentary meeting, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China. Under Xi, China has clamped down on dissent and tightened censorship.

{"title": "Medical technologists abstain from work over 6-point demand", "body": "Medical technologists at all the government hospitals and health education institutions went on work abstention from 11am-1pm to drive home their six-point demand on Thursday. The Bangladesh Medical Technologist Association (BMTA) organised the two-hour work abstention programme. However, the healthcare workers continued emergency services during the protest. During the programme, the medical technologists gathered in front of their respective institutions. They said they were forced to go on work abstention as the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) did not respond to their demands that had been voiced earlier. BMTA President Almas Ali Khan said if the DGHS does not meet their demands immediately, they will go on work abstention at the hospitals and medical education institutions for three hours from 10am to 1pm next Wednesday, keeping only the emergency services undisrupted. Earlier on July 5, medical technologists staged a sit-in at the DGHS, demanding recruitment of jobless medical technologists who have crossed the age limit, salary under grade-10 of the national pay scale, a separate board for diploma medical education, creation of new posts and cancelation of recruitment of employees through a process that lacks transparency. Almas said, \"During the work abstention programme today, services at the pathology radiology, physiology, dental and radiotherapy departments, and blood banks were hampered.\" Collecting samples and testing at the PCR labs for the novel coronavirus were also hampered at that time, but the emergency services were continued on a limited scale, he added.

{"title": "One-Car Solution: 2018 Mercedes CLA45 AMG Shooting Brake", "body": "For years, Bangladesh has had exactly one example of the 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 AMG Shooting Brake, a body style Mercedes never pushed hard even in the markets that actually received it. It was imported back in 2018 through Rancon Motors as a brand-new car and has been the only Shooting Brake in the country since, an uncommon remnant of a short-lived era when AMG had been playing around with compact performance estates. The CLA45 AMG Shooting Brake was never a normal fit in the Mercedes line. It is technically an estate, but Mercedes leaned towards the label of 'Shooting Brake' to make it as far as it could be from something that looks like a regular wagon. The sweeping roofline, tight proportions, and hunched stance provide the car with a silhouette that cannot be compared to any other car in its class. It was never aimed at conservative markets, which makes its presence here even more unlikely. Even globally, it catered to buyers who wanted AMG performance but refused to settle for the expected shapes. Inside, the cabin shows AMG's earlier philosophy for compact performance cars. The Recaro bucket seats, which are draped in Alcantara, provide a focused and well-supported driving position, with no sense of being out of place in day-to-day use. The steering wheel has red stitches, and the red seatbelts are a good match with the rest of the interior, which is darker than any luxury-oriented interior can be. The dashboard is quite clean, albeit slightly older than the current cabin heavy screens, and it all works. During the photoshoot, I sat down with the owner for a chat on what it actually takes to use and maintain something this rare in a country that overwhelmingly purchases hybrid sedans and crossovers. The owner, Nafiz Ahnaf Islam, bought the car after it had spent time unused. \"When I first got it, it needed some love, as it had been sitting for a while in a basement. I had to change all the fluids, change some sensors, and get a new set of tires; that's it,\" he said. Cars left stationary in Bangladesh's humidity tend to collect these problems, and the Shooting Brake was no exception. However, once everything was fixed, the engine was more than enough to work with. Inside, the cabin shows AMG’s earlier philosophy for compact performance cars. PHOTO: Akif Hamid Under the hood lies one of the most widely praised four-cylinder engines of AMG at that time. Its 2.0-litre turbocharged engine produces 375 bhp at 6,000 rpm and 475 Nm of torque at 2,250-5,000 rpm, and in this particular unit it is coupled with the complete AMG Dynamic Plus Package. \"The power is adequate for Bangladesh roads.\" Nafiz stated, \"In Dhaka especially, 380 hp and 450 Nm torque feels more than enough.\" The hand-built motor sends power to all four wheels through a 7-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission to give the small estate a 0–100 km/h time of roughly 4.7 seconds. The Shooting Brake shell is heavier than the sedan and hatchback CLA45s but the difference in acceleration is hardly noticeable. The package includes an additional limited-slip front differential to be able to get out of corners sharper, bigger red 6-piston front calipers, and a higher top-speed limit of 270 km/h rather than 250 km/h. It also has optional AMG Performance Exhaust, which enables the driver to access the more aggressive soundtrack of the engine with the press of a button. The Recaro bucket seats, which are draped in Alcantara, provide a focused and well-supported driving position. PHOTO: Akif Hamid The exhaust note puts an attitude that most four-cylinders can scarcely achieve. Instead of a solid, consistent sound, the AMG system superimposes a layer of burbles, metal pops and crackles. It shifts with each throttle input, muffled or sudden, according to mode and purpose. The car sounds suppressed until it is not. On the road, the car behaves nothing like a typical compact luxury model. The system defaults to a front-wheel-drive bias in city traffic to keep it controllable and prevent unnecessary strain. Push the throttle harder, and the AWD system purposefully locks in, distributing power equally and holding onto the road with a mechanical stubbornness. The chassis isn't pretending to be plush. It's built to hold on, not to float over broken tarmac. Handling remains one of the car's standout traits. \"It handles very well for the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. It never lost grip while cornering, not even in rain when I was doing high speed,\" Nafiz added. That kind of reliability comes from an AWD setup built for smaller, high-output AMG cars long before the brand shifted to bigger, heavier platforms. Performance wagons already confuse most buyers; a compact one stands out even more. Thus, public reactions are mixed. \"Most people appreciate it,\" Nafiz said, \"some people don't like the shape, I guess. I personally love it; that's all that matters.\" Not everything is perfect though. As Nafiz mentioned, ground clearance is an issue. The suspension is designed for smooth European highways not Dhaka's patched asphalt which makes it feel stiff. So, potholes and uneven speed breakers require attention. Fuel quality adds another hurdle, demanding consistent high-octane or additives to keep the engine clean. However, by now, he has learnt to live with it. The AMG Dynamic Plus Package also sports larger wheels and upgraded AMG brakes. PHOTO: Akif Hamid As a daily machine, it plays these two roles well: It is silent, predictable, and non-obtrusive in Comfort mode, just as any other compact car. Change to Sport Plus, and it all becomes sharper: the exhaust valves open, the shifts become aggressive, and the car is another one altogether. It is that duality that Nafiz appreciates the most. \"This is like one car for everything,\" he said. \"Commute, school duties, driving with family, cruising with friends, occasionally speeding if roads are empty. And the most important feature is, it's a reliable car with a hand-built engine by AMG.\" When I asked about his future plans with this, his answer was rather open-ended. \"I plan to keep it for now but might sell the car in the future if I get an equivalent replacement for it, considering the right price is offered and it goes into good hands.\" He answered. \"Otherwise, I plan to keep it and enjoy it for as long as possible.\" All in all, this unit of CLA45 AMG is a unique combination of functionality and outright performance in a form that Bangladesh simply doesn't buy. This one AMG estate may remain unrivaled for years, if not decades, due to import trends that heavily favor sedans and SUVs. It serves as a reminder of the one occasion when someone chose to introduce something novel, and the nation was left with a machine that is unlikely to be replicated by anyone else. The owner, Nafiz Ahnaf Islam, bought the car after it had spent time unused. \"When I first got it, it needed some love, as it had been sitting for a while in a basement.

Its 2.0-litre turbocharged engine produces 375 bhp at 6,000 rpm and 475 Nm of torque at 2,250-5,000 rpm, and in this particular unit it is coupled with the complete AMG Dynamic Plus Package. \"The power is adequate for Bangladesh roads.\" Nafiz stated, \"In Dhaka especially, 380 hp and 450 Nm torque feels more than enough.\" The hand-built motor sends power to all four wheels through a 7-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission to give the small estate a 0–100 km/h time of roughly 4.7 seconds. The Shooting Brake shell is heavier than the sedan and hatchback CLA45s but the difference in acceleration is hardly noticeable. The package includes an additional limited-slip front differential to be able to get out of corners sharper, bigger red 6-piston front calipers, and a higher top-speed limit of 270 km/h rather than 250 km/h. It also has optional AMG Performance Exhaust, which enables the driver to access the more aggressive soundtrack of the engine with the press of a button. The Recaro bucket seats, which are draped in Alcantara, provide a focused and well-supported driving position. PHOTO: Akif Hamid The exhaust note puts an attitude that most four-cylinders can scarcely achieve. Instead of a solid, consistent sound, the AMG system superimposes a layer of burbles, metal pops and crackles. It shifts with each throttle input, muffled or sudden, according to mode and purpose. The car sounds suppressed until it is not. On the road, the car behaves nothing like a typical compact luxury model. The system defaults to a front-wheel-drive bias in city traffic to keep it controllable and prevent unnecessary strain. Push the throttle harder, and the AWD system purposefully locks in, distributing power equally and holding onto the road with a mechanical stubbornness. The chassis isn't pretending to be plush. It's built to hold on, not to float over broken tarmac. Handling remains one of the car's standout traits. \"It handles very well for the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system. It never lost grip while cornering, not even in rain when I was doing high speed,\" Nafiz added. That kind of reliability comes from an AWD setup built for smaller, high-output AMG cars long before the brand shifted to bigger, heavier platforms. Performance wagons already confuse most buyers; a compact one stands out even more. Thus, public reactions are mixed. \"Most people appreciate it,\" Nafiz said, \"some people don't like the shape, I guess. I personally love it; that's all that matters.\" Not everything is perfect though. As Nafiz mentioned, ground clearance is an issue. The suspension is designed for smooth European highways not Dhaka's patched asphalt which makes it feel stiff. So, potholes and uneven speed breakers require attention. Fuel quality adds another hurdle, demanding consistent high-octane or additives to keep the engine clean. However, by now, he has learnt to live with it. The AMG Dynamic Plus Package also sports larger wheels and upgraded AMG brakes. PHOTO: Akif Hamid As a daily machine, it plays these two roles well: It is silent, predictable, and non-obtrusive in Comfort mode, just as any other compact car. Change to Sport Plus, and it all becomes sharper: the exhaust valves open, the shifts become aggressive, and the car is another one altogether. It is that duality that Nafiz appreciates the most. \"This is like one car for everything,\" he said. \"Commute, school duties, driving with family, cruising with friends, occasionally speeding if roads are empty. And the most important feature is, it's a reliable car with a hand-built engine by AMG.\" When I asked about his future plans with this, his answer was rather open-ended. \"I plan to keep it for now but might sell the car in the future if I get an equivalent replacement for it, considering the right price is offered and it goes into good hands.\" He answered. \"Otherwise, I plan to keep it and enjoy it for as long as possible.\" All in all, this unit of CLA45 AMG is a unique combination of functionality and outright performance in a form that Bangladesh simply doesn't buy. This one AMG estate may remain unrivaled for years, if not decades, due to import trends that heavily favor sedans and SUVs. It serves as a reminder of the one occasion when someone chose to introduce something novel, and the nation was left with a machine that is unlikely to be replicated by anyone else. \"The power is adequate for Bangladesh roads.\" Nafiz stated, \"In Dhaka especially, 380 hp and 450 Nm torque feels more than enough.\" The hand-built motor sends power to all four wheels through a 7-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission to give the small estate a 0–100 km/h time of roughly 4.7 seconds.

Xi said that over the past year, China-India relations have continued to improve and develop and are of \"great significance for maintaining and promoting world peace and prosperity,\" according to Xinhua. Xi said China has always believed that being \"good neighbours, friends and partners\" is the right choice for both China and India. He referred to China and India as the \"dragon and the elephant dancing together,\" Xinhua said. Xi said he hoped that both sides would expand exchanges and cooperation and address each other's concerns to promote healthy and stable relations. The nuclear-armed Asian neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400-mile) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. Ties between the countries were shaken by a 2020 clash in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat. After that, the Himalayan border was heavily militarised by both sides. Both countries began improving ties last year after staging a series of high-level bilateral visits. Direct flights resumed in 2025 as both countries stepped up trade and investment flows against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's combative foreign policy.

{"title": "Britain set to ban Huawei from 5G, though timescale unclear", "body": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to ban Huawei from Britain's 5G network in a landmark decision that will anger Beijing but win plaudits from President Donald Trump as the United States grapples with China's rising economic and technological clout. The United States has pushed Johnson to reverse his January decision to grant Huawei a limited role in 5G, while London has been dismayed by a crackdown in Hong Kong and by the perception that China did not tell the whole truth over coronavirus. Britain's National Security Council (NSC), chaired by Johnson, will meet on Tuesday to discuss Huawei. Media Secretary Oliver Dowden will announce a decision to the House of Commons later in the day. The immediate excuse for the about turn in British policy is the impact of new US sanctions on chip technology, which London says affects Huawei's ability to remain a reliable supplier in the future. It is unclear how far Johnson will go on Tuesday. Operators already had to cap Huawei's role in 5G at 35 percent by 2023. Reducing it to zero over an additional two to fours years is now being discussed, although some telecoms firms have warned that going too fast could delay key technology and disrupt services. Asked about Huawei in June, Johnson said he would protect critical infrastructure from \"hostile state vendors\". Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said on Monday the \"priority\" in the decision would be national security. The United States says Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is an agent of the Chinese Communist State and cannot be trusted. Huawei denies it spies for China and has said the United States wants to frustrate its growth because no US company could offer the same range of technology at a competitive price. In what some have compared to the Cold War antagonism with the Soviet Union, the United States is worried that 5G dominance is a milestone towards Chinese technological supremacy that could define the geopolitics of the 21st century. Angering China just as Britain extracts itself from the European Union will put London firmly back on the side of its closest ally, the United States. It would also mark the end of what former Prime Minister David Cameron cast as a \"golden era\" in ties with China. China's ambassador to Britain said earlier this month a U-turn on Huawei would damage Britain's image and it would have to \"bear the consequences\" if it treated China as a hostile country. In January, Johnson defied Trump by allowing so-called high-risk companies' involvement in 5G - including Huawei - to be capped at 35 percent. He excluded such companies from the sensitive 5G \"core\", where data is processed, as well as critical networks and locations such as nuclear and military sites. Britain's major telecoms networks have said they need at least five years, and ideally seven, to remove Huawei. BT CEO Philip Jansen urged the government on Monday not to move too fast on a ban, cautioning there could be outages and even security issues if it did. \"If we get to a situation where things need to go very, very fast, then you are into a situation where potentially service for 24 million BT Group mobile customers is put into question - outages,\" he told BBC radio. Huawei has said the implications of the US sanctions are not yet clear, and it has urged Britain to wait. The Telegraph newspaper said on Friday the government was expected to set a deadline of 2025 for removing Huawei equipment.

He expressed disappointment about the lack of enough international pressure on Myanmar to take back the Rohingya who are currently camped in Cox’s Bazar. The Bangladesh government is seeking aid from United Nation agencies for its plan to relocate 100,000 refugees to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal. Different Human rights organization have expressed doubt about the suitability of the island for habitation, and also about the probability of it being hit by cyclones. On being asked how the UN would react to it, the foreign minister said that the UN has to agree to the plan or it can take the refugees with them. He further explained that the number of Rohingya refugees in the area is more than double the number of local citizens. Local residents are increasingly complaining of criminal activities, therefore the Bangladesh government could force their relocation. He also added that Bangladesh is not a rich nation. It is the world's most densely populated country. Still it has done a lot for the Rohingya. It's time for others to come forward because it is not just Bangladesh’s problem.

{"title": "End of an era: 5 cars not making it into 2026", "body": "With the beginning of 2026, the automotive world is moving rapidly toward electrification, stricter emission regulations, and aggressive cost-cutting. Amid the rush, some iconic and familiar cars are quietly reaching the end of the road. For these models, 2025 was the final year of availability, and as the calendar flipped to 2026, they are no longer rolling out of factories or are available to purchase in Bangladesh anymore. For enthusiasts in Bangladesh, this matters more than it may seem. Many of these cars dominate our grey import market, shape our street culture, and heavily influence resale values. In this article, we look at five cars that will not make it into 2026—vehicles that defined an era and are now becoming instant modern classics. A supercar that changed everything. The Nissan GT-R R35 is arguably the most iconic car on this list. Debuting in 2007, it shattered global perceptions of Japanese performance engineering and redefined what a supercar could be. The R35 GT-R also became a cultural icon far beyond its raw numbers. Owners praised how approachable it felt, advanced electronics and all-wheel drive made its performance usable even for drivers who were not professionals, while still rewarding skilled hands with incredible lap times. The engineering was equally meticulous. Power came from a 3.8-liter, 60-degree DOHC twin-turbo hand-built V6 with 24 valves. A 6-speed dual-clutch transmission delivered lightning-fast shifts in just 150–200 milliseconds. When Nissan ended R35 production on February 28, 2025, after an incredible 18-year run, the automotive world lost one of its greatest modern legends. Since then, no successor has been officially announced. Production Years: 2007–2025 Toyota Allion and Premio A car that needs no introduction in Bangladesh. The Toyota Allion and its twin, the Premio, represent a distinctly Japanese phenomenon—a premium-branded sedan that never officially left its home market. For nearly two decades, these cars served as Japan's go-to family sedan. The Toyota Allion was offered with three engine options over its life: a 1.5L 4-cylinder (1NZ-FE), a 1.8L (2ZR-FAE), and a 2.0L (3ZR-FAE), with the 1500cc variant being the most popular choice among buyers due to its balance of fuel economy and lower annual income tax (AIT). This variant is paired to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) prioritizing smooth, efficient everyday driving over outright performance. However, when production ended in March 2021, it marked the close of a 20-year lineage of refined Japanese sedans. The Allion's discontinuation was not due to poor sales or declining relevance; quite the opposite in fact. Bangladesh maintains a strict import rule: vehicles cannot be more than five years old at the time of shipment. Age is calculated from the first day of the year following manufacture. This means a car produced in 2020 became six years old on January 1, 2021—making it ineligible for import. Production Years: 2001–2021 Lexus RC F The RC F represented Lexus’s commitment to traditional Japanese performance at a time when the industry was rapidly shifting toward turbocharged four-cylinders and electrification. PHOTO: Akif Hamid While the GT-R grabbed headlines, Lexus quietly built one of the most underrated performance coupes of the modern era. The RC F represented Lexus's commitment to traditional Japanese performance at a time when the industry was rapidly shifting toward turbocharged four-cylinders and electrification. Its defining feature was a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8—a rarity in today's day and age. This engine used both port and direct fuel injection, optimizing combustion across all driving conditions. With a 32-valve DOHC layout, it delivered strong performance throughout the rev range. Despite its excellence, the RC F faced an impossible market. Insurance premiums, fuel economy regulations, and the industry's pivot toward crossovers and SUVs made its sales numbers look anemic compared to contemporary models. Lexus's corporate mandate to electrify the lineup meant the naturally-aspirated V8 had no future. As December 2025 approached, the final RC F came off the production line—a final hurrah for a car that never received the recognition it deserved. Production Years: 2015–2025 Porsche 718 Cayman and Boxster As Porsche orders closed in September 2025 and production ended in October, the 718 bowed out with a limited Final Edition for select markets. PHOTO: Nafirul Haq The Porsche 718 Cayman and Boxster belong to a generation caught between eras. Launched in 2016 as replacements for the 981, they initially faced criticism for switching to turbocharged four-cylinder engines. Over time, however, the 718 evolved into one of the most capable and engaging sports cars Porsche ever built. The voluntary PDK 7-speed dual-clutch automatic offered faster shifts and convenience for those who preferred it, but Porsche kept the manual available because the target audience demanded it. The standard 6-speed manual transmission, increasingly rare in the industry, exemplified Porsche's commitment to the driver's involvement. As Porsche orders closed in September 2025 and production ended in October, the 718 bowed out with a limited Final Edition for select markets. By 2026, no new 718s will arrive. Production Years: 2016–2025 BMW Z4 On November 24, 2025, BMW announced something that stunned the automotive world: the Z4 is finished. PHOTO: Nafirul Haq On November 24, 2025, BMW announced something that stunned the automotive world: the Z4 is finished. More importantly, there will be no successor. Unlike discontinued models that transition to electric power or evolve into new platforms, BMW is completely exiting the premium two-seat convertible roadster market after 24 years. The current generation Z4 represents the final expression of this philosophy. It offers three powerplant options: a modest 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder, a competent 2.0 L four-cylinder, and the standout M40i with its 3.0 L turbocharged inline-six. The Z4 remains as one of the final reminders of BMW's heritage of naturally aspirated turbocharged six-cylinder excellence. Production ends between March and May 2026. For Bangladesh's market, this compounds perfectly with the country's five-year import restriction. Final-production Z4s will be brand new; older examples will exceed the legal import age. Production Years: 2019–2026 The Toyota Allion was offered with three engine options over its life: a 1.5L 4-cylinder (1NZ-FE), a 1.8L (2ZR-FAE), and a 2.0L (3ZR-FAE), with the 1500cc variant being the most popular choice among buyers due to its balance of fuel economy and lower annual income tax (AIT).

Production Years: 2019–2026 The RC F represented Lexus's commitment to traditional Japanese performance at a time when the industry was rapidly shifting toward turbocharged four-cylinders and electrification. Its defining feature was a naturally aspirated 5.0-liter V8—a rarity in today's day and age. This engine used both port and direct fuel injection, optimizing combustion across all driving conditions. With a 32-valve DOHC layout, it delivered strong performance throughout the rev range. Despite its excellence, the RC F faced an impossible market. Insurance premiums, fuel economy regulations, and the industry's pivot toward crossovers and SUVs made its sales numbers look anemic compared to contemporary models. Lexus's corporate mandate to electrify the lineup meant the naturally-aspirated V8 had no future. As December 2025 approached, the final RC F came off the production line—a final hurrah for a car that never received the recognition it deserved. Production Years: 2015–2025 Porsche 718 Cayman and Boxster The Porsche 718 Cayman and Boxster belong to a generation caught between eras. Launched in 2016 as replacements for the 981, they initially faced criticism for switching to turbocharged four-cylinder engines. Over time, however, the 718 evolved into one of the most capable and engaging sports cars Porsche ever built. The voluntary PDK 7-speed dual-clutch automatic offered faster shifts and convenience for those who preferred it, but Porsche kept the manual available because the target audience demanded it. The standard 6-speed manual transmission, increasingly rare in the industry, exemplified Porsche's commitment to the driver's involvement. As Porsche orders closed in September 2025 and production ended in October, the 718 bowed out with a limited Final Edition for select markets. By 2026, no new 718s will arrive.

The information was revealed at the concluding session of an event titled “Digital Service Design and Planning Lab” today. State Minister for ICT Division, Zunaid Ahmed Palak, was present as the chief guest at the event, while Health Secretary Md Ashadul Islam joined as the special guest. Vice Chancellor of BSMMU, Dr Kanak Kanti Barua, presided over the session. The public medical university will be digitised in three phases; The first phase, to be inaugurated on December 12, 2020, will have 15 basic medical facilities including one step information service management, queue management, registration, admission, transfer, discharge, appointment, billing, prescription management, casualty and emergency management, blood bank management and drug and pharmacy management. The second phase, which will be launched in June 2021, will cover 18 features, including human resource management, bed management, nurse station management and ICU management. The third stage will have 12 services, including financial management, parking space management and morgue management, and it will be launched in December 2021. Digitising BSMMU will require a total cost of Tk27.50 crore, funded jointly by the university, the ICT ministry and the health ministry. “Introduction of health insurance, e-medicine and e-prescription will bring down medical costs of the patients,” said Zunaid Ahmed Palak. The state minister also talked about the government’s plan to establish a central health record database, under which, a patient will be able to get registered from anywhere in Bangladesh. “I want to introduce e-documentation first and a2i [Access to Information] will lend all out support for this,” said Palak. Speaking at the event, Health Secretary Md Ashadul Islam said: “Medicare is the largest service sector. It will be a tremendous achievement for Bangladesh if the health sector can be digitised.” He said as much as 80% digitisation of the health sector will be done if the medical universities come under digital facilities.

{"title": "The supercar drives into the sunset", "body": "At the Frankfurt Auto Show next month, Lamborghini will unveil a hybrid version of the Aventador. The Bologna, Italy-based brand will make 63 of them, all already spoken for. That is the rumour, at least. Lamborghini has declined to comment on any plans to debut an electric-motor supercar, though it has hinted at it publicly in recent months and described in past detail how such special projects form an integral part of the business. “The Reventon prompted the big discussion about the dimensions of this segment,\" Maurizio Reggiani, Lamborgini’s chief engineer, told Bloomberg Pursuits during an interview in his office at company headquarters, noting that Lamborghini “started\" the segment with its Lamborghini Reventon in 2007. “We were the first to do it like this. As we scouted more and more during that time, we started to see how, in this market, you can stretch in terms of price and in terms of demand. The Reventon coupe was $3 million; the [Reventon] roadster was $3.2 million; the Centenario was $2 million. So in this segment, we know there is a marvellous market.\" The mid-engine V12, all-wheel-drive Reventon famously hit 220mph on a test in Dubai, an astounding figure for a production car at that time. Only 20 were made, plus one marked for the Lamborghini museum. Should it happen, the new hybrid will join a burgeoning field of extremely limited-edition hybrid and electric supercars from such luxury powerhouses as Aston Martin, Ferrari, Koenigsegg, Lotus, Mercedes-Benz, and Pininfarina. They have been flaunted recently in dazzling hues on golf courses and during private parties at seaside villas, heralded on Instagram fanboy accounts and Rodeo Drive parades orchestrated for YouTube. Where it used to be that a company would have only one ever, or at most, one per year, now it seems they’re whipping them up as fast as possible. In the past year, Aston Martin alone has debuted and promised supercars in spades: the super-lightweight 1,160-horsepower Valkyrie and the 986 hp Valhalla hybrids, plus a Vanquish Vision concept and Valkyrie AMR Pro concept, not to mention the electric offerings from its Lagonda department. They follow the precedent from the One-77 and Vulcan supercars that came in the years before. It’s quite a different mood for what used to be a staid, small automaker tucked into the verdant hills of England’s Cotswolds region. Many supercars, such as the $2.72 million Mercedes-AMG Project One limited-to-275 hybrid supercar based on Mercedes’s Formula 1 car, is sold as concepts, or very rough prototypes, and require six- or seven-figure deposits years in advance to ensure delivery. Others are sold with even less—a few sketches, a rendering, a foam-filled shell at an auto show. That’s if you can even get on the list to buy one. The official party line for most, like the Lambo, is that they have sold out before they’re even seen. Some collectors are starting to find the rigmarole rather tedious. We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality “We need an awakening and cleansing soon to get everyone back into reality,\" says Dan Kang, the well-known car collector based in Southern California, who owns a McLaren Senna, a Guntherwerks Porsche 911, and Lamborghini Centenario in similar carbon fiber livery, among other supercars. “It’s not even the new companies, but the current heritage brands as well, who feel they can demand the new price points without much substance. They need to support what they have already sold—not what [car] they can shovel up next.\" When manufacturers are unveiling cars that can’t be driven for years to come, and the very people able to afford them are over the hype anyway, it raises the question: Have we reached peak supercar? Supermodels in car world Modern supercars, and their higher-end cousins, hypercars—both relative terms defined largely by whom you ask—are latecomers to the thread of automotive history. First, there were the rockets of their time, such as the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of the 1930s and 300SL Gullwings of the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Ferrari 250 GTOs dominated countless races and reached automotive immortality as the ultimate auction house blue-chip buys. But the supercar as we know it really came into its own in the late 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s, when hedonism reigned supreme. Such early examples as the Lamborghini Countach and Ferrari F40 set major precedents for design and performance. They were like space ships, compared the mundane and affordable metal boxes of the day. Everyone has a favorite; just ask the guys down at the weekend coffee klatch about the Vector, the Ferrari Enzo, or the Porsche Carrera GT. You’ll get a reaction. They were duly expensive. A Countach sold for $72,000 at the time, or the equivalent of $375,000 today; the F40 cost $400,000, or the equivalent of $884,000 today. Supercars tend to age well if you have the patience, luck, and financing to get your hands on one: On Aug. 16 in Monterey, Calif., a 1994 McLaren F1 sold for $19.8 million, obliterating the previous high-price paid for a McLaren: $13.75 million in 2015. (Its original MSRP was around $1 million.) You won’t be surprised to learn that the man who designed that car, Gordon Murray, is now designing a round of 100 new supercars tentatively called the T50 and priced near $3 million. The role of the supercar used to be to act as the halo for the brand, to attract media attention and consumer hype to a marque. Even if only a few people could afford to actually buy the exciting, sexy car, they’d know about the brand because of it and then buy something more affordable. Automakers figured that if you loved, or at least knew about, the Acura NSX that Formula 1 champion Aryton Senna helped develop, you’d be more likely to buy an Accord. It seems a stretch—but the basic awareness of a brand is half the battle, marketers say. And an NSX is a lot more likely to grab headlines than an Accord is. Supercars also carried the advanced driving technologies consumers could expect to see seep into the rest of the product lineup in succeeding years. The SF90 Stradale that Ferrari debuted in May is the first plug-in hybrid in Ferrari’s history, while its 679-horsepower twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 is also the first time a V8 has ever been under a Ferrari hood. Its gasoline engine and trio of electric motors combined make it the most powerful Ferrari ever, totaling 968 horsepower. In fact, the SF90 is the latest in an onslaught of supercars that has taken a slightly different tone. Supercars are increasingly electric, rather than powered by the galloping V12 and W16 engines of old. The Aston Martin Valkyrie, Koenigsegg Jesko, Lotus Evija, Mercedes-Benz Project One, and Pininfarina Battista, among others, all use electric motors to help boost them to ever-higher (at least in theory) feats of speed and strength. They all have yet to hit the market in production form. They’re coming from all sides of the market, too: such big, old heritage brands as Lamborghini and Ferrari, of course, but also from namesake novelty brands such as Gordon Murray Automotive and just-minted startups dotting the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, Korea, Japan and China. These boutiques tend to have obscure names and opaque origins, blending the lines among automotive companies, tech companies, and software startups. Witness the British Dendrobium D1 and Ariel P40, the Chinese XING Mobility Miss E, the Croatian Rimac Concept_One, and the Japanese Aspark Owl. They come and go in the automotive consciousness, many making a splash at a car show with a foam mold or rendering, trotting that same car around for a year or two, then quietly merging with a larger auto or tech company, or shutting down altogether. Rather than loss-leaders for the brand, they’re now a big part of the business model—or the business model. The seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car The seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car “Basically, [the deposits to the supercar startups are] seed money to get operations up and running—applied to the cost of the car,\" says Kevin Tynan, senior automotive analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Think of it as venture capital, with the return being a supercar instead of a percentage.\" In November, Lamborghini announced the one-off Lamborghini SC18 Alston, created for a single customer at a multimillion-dollar cost. It was a strategy that took cues from the Lamborghini Reventon: When it debuted, its almost immediate sell-out success of all 20 models to Middle Eastern sheiks and Russian billionaires proved to Lamborghini brass that the market could handle the extravagant price and exclusivity of vehicles heretofore considered too wild for it to bear. This paved the way for the $4.5 million Veneno and the aforementioned, 759-horsepower Centenario, rare-as-plutonium supercars that came several years later. Reggiani characterized the one-offs as a not-insignificant part of Lamborghini’s bottom line, though he declined to give a percentage. Elsewhere, Ferrari, which announced a Special Projects Division 10 years ago, has built one-off cars such as the Superamerica 45 and the P540 Superfast Aperta. Aston Martin has quietly made such one-offs as the CC100 and Valkyrie hybrid; McLaren made the 1,035-hp hybrid Speedtail. “The sky is the limit,\" Bugatti chief Stephan Winkelmann said this summer at the Villa d’Este Concours d’Elegance. The company had just unveiled the La Voiture Noir car purchased by Ferdinand Piëch, the notorious Volkswagen boss who died Aug 25. The car cost nearly $19 million, after taxes and fees. Proponents, and corporate press materials rave about the shocking designs and extensive technologies of these extreme supercars, but their proliferation has simultaneously spurred the customary cadre of critics. Those sceptics—or, maybe, prophets—point to a whole lot of empty promises from the automakers and question their connection to reality, whether now or later. There’s no question that in the future the world is going to have to change. Consumers will have to find sustainable transportation, says Jim Glickenhaus, who makes road-legal hypercars and supercars of his own. But he notes that his wife’s Tesla S is already much faster than she could ever drive it on public roads, both legally and logistically. “Where are you going to drive a 2,000-horsepower electric supercar? You’ll run out of the road,\" he says. “I already get a headache in the Tesla! And now we’re getting 2,000-horsepower hyper-electric cars? Seriously. Why you would ever need a 2000-horsepower electric hypercar? I just don’t understand. You’re never going to drive a hypercar to pick up groceries.\" Not that any of the people who currently own the few electric hypercars that have actually come to market ever go grocery shopping; the idea is that there is a finite and very small market for that type of car at all, and we are near reaching the saturation point. Call it hypercar fatigue, contagious only among those who have been buying the hypercars in the first place. Many of the new supercars are not legal to bring into the United States under normal permitting, anyway. They’re legal only to “show and display,\" not to drive on public roads, because they don’t meet federal safety and emissions regulations. The Ferrari Icona Series Monza SP1 and SP2 cars, for instance, are legal for track use only. Not that it matters. Follow Kang on Instagram or Mattress King collector Michael Fux for any length of time, and you’ll see they drive their more-practical Porsches and Rolls-Royces more than the hypercars they hoard. (Fux recently pulled up to Manhattan's Cipriani restaurant in his white Rolls, for instance, rather than his green Senna.) Peruse the auction catalogues of any major sale, browse through the feed of wealthy Youtube go-getters, or ask the young scions of Saudi families: They’re all bragging about how few miles their supercar has on the odometer, not about the great drive they took up the coast, say The popular thing for younger, newer collectors seems to be not driving your car, instead of driving it—a drastic change from the longstanding tradition of the best, most hallowed cars earning their stripes by taking epic drives, winning adventure races, and parading through Paris. This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself “This whole modern supercar-hypercar market is destined to collapse under its own weight and implode on itself,\" says Winston Goodfellow, an automotive author and analyst who judged the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance last month. “After all, if the things aren’t being utilized for their original purpose, there are only so many suckers and cult members out there who will agree that this weird Kool-Aid actually tastes good and makes sense to drink.\" There are other cracks in the proverbial armour. Mercedes-AMG has yet to deliver any of the Project One cars it promised nearly three years ago. (Deliveries are set for 2021, according to a Mercedes spokesman.) So does Ariel, with the P40 it announced in 2017; Aspark, with the undelivered Owls it announced in 2018; and XING, with the Miss R it announced in 2017. Dendrobium, which announced the D1 last year and has said it would be ready by 2022, is already pointing to Brexit as a reason why it may not be able to deliver on its promises. “So many investors have said to us that they’re keen but need some resolution one way or another,\" Dendrobium boss Nigel Gordon-Stewart told Top Gear. Indeed. Read through the fine lines of press releases about the new supercars and you’ll see phrases like “working toward being fully funded\" and “working to develop a technology partner,\" verbal cues that the company is far from anywhere near being able to make production cars. Faraday Future unveiled an electric hypercar concept called the FFZERO1 in 2016 without even having a factory—or the money to build one. It has yet to produce any cars. Then there’s the fact that the values of the first supercars are slumping. The McLaren F1 that sold in Monterey set a record—but failed to match even the low end of its estimated value before the sale. At the Gooding & Co. auctions in Arizona earlier this year, a 1990 Countach failed to reach even its low-value estimate of $275,000; so did a Ferrari Testarossa listed for $250,000-$300,000 that sold for (just) $221,200. The automakers themselves remain notoriously cagey about exactly how supercar sales have been faring. Many blast instant- or near-immediate sell-out numbers in press releases, while others—when asked privately and perhaps more transparently—say that roughly half sold very early, and the rest are expected to sell in the coming weeks. Bugatti, one of the more forthcoming of the lot, has said that this applies to its Centodieci. It famously had to sell only one of the La Voiture Noire cars, anyway the one that went to Piech. It’s telling, if anecdotal, that public sentiment may be shifting. Locals near one of the biggest annual supercar gatherings in the world—on Cannery Row in Monterey during car week—even succeeded in getting it cancelled this year amid complaints of noise and general disruption. Please don’t “hoon\" around in your Lamborghini, one Instagram user requested. It was a blow to the automotive “influencers\" who are the prime targets for the hypercars—to their egos, at least. After all, if you can’t show off your supercar on social media, is it even really yours, bro? “The pendulum has already started to swing. It’s just that people don’t notice it because all these manufacturers are flooding the market with new product and obfuscating the view,\" says Goodfellow. “When you have companies selling things that can’t even be driven on the street—and no one thinks this is weird—there is real distortion.\"", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/supercar-drives-sunset", "date": "2019-09-04T14:20:00+06:00", "author": "LiveMint 04 September, 2019, 02:20 pm Last modified: 04 September, 2019, 02:43 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 2660, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:28:46.953099"}
{"title": "Malaysia searching for a Bangladeshi, who appeared in Al Jazeera documentary", "body": "Malaysian immigration Department has circulated a notice on Tuesday seeking public information on a Bangladeshi national to be investigated under the Immigration Act 1959/1963. In its notice, the Immigration Department provided the name of the 25-year-old man, his passport number and his last known address in Kuala Lumpur, urging for the public to contact the department with any information they could provide to assist in the investigations, Malay Mail reported. The man was among those quoted by Al Jazeera in its recent 101 East documentary, and his personal details have since been circulated by Malaysians online who are angry with the critical report which carried allegations of mistreatment of migrant workers in Malaysia. In the documentary, the Bangladeshi national said, \"This is not the way to treat a migrant worker. It is not the way to treat a human.They made a trap for us. They may give food, they give medication. All these things they give. So no one is expecting they are going to arrest people. They are not murderers. They are not criminals. They are just undocumented. \"He (my friend) also has been arrested this time. That was not his fault. His company never renewed his visa. He was arrested. You know I ran, I ran to immigration. I ran to the police station. I cried at the gate, \"Please, let me meet my friend,\" he also said in the documentary. The company which had previously contracted his services disassociated itself with him, calling his views \"biased\" and pledging cooperation with authorities. The company asserted that the man never worked as its employee, adding that the man's statements were his own personal views and did not reflect the company's stand. Describing the man's remarks in the documentary as \"damaging\", the company said it disagreed and opposed his views, while also emphasising its respect and pride for Malaysia and saying that it would not tolerate any negative or defamatory comments against the country. The Immigration Department's notice comes as Immigration director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud warned that foreign nationals who make inaccurate statements aimed at \"damaging Malaysia's image\" will face possible revocation of their passes. Khairul Dzaimee said the Al Jazeera documentary on immigration operations during the movement control order was inaccurate, pointing out that the Malaysian government had provided free treatment to 773 foreigners in immigration depots who tested positive for Covid-19 and had been praised by foreign embassies for doing so. On July 3, Qatar-based news channel Al Jazeera released a 25.50 minute-long documentary titled \"Locked up in Malaysia's lockdown\" regarding undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia. On July 5, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba said the allegations of the Malaysian authorities' discrimination against undocumented migrants was incorrect, saying that measures taken to detect Covid-19 was applied to all regardless of whether they were citizens or not. Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin said the authorities had merely acted in line with the public's wish for all living in Malaysia to comply with local laws, including for foreigners to have the necessary permit and valid documents to be allowed to work here. Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob also said that the Al Jazeera documentary was malicious and had carried false allegations of purported wrongful detainment of illegal migrants in areas under that were placed under the enhanced movement control order (EMCO), pointing out that the same movement restrictions and government-paid Covid-19 screening during the EMCO applied to both locals and foreigners alike. Ismail Sabri had also clarified that the Malaysian government gave the same treatment to foreigners regardless of whether they had official documentation or were without proper documents, by screening and treating them for Covid-19. But he also pointed out that undocumented migrants that tested negative for Covid-19 or recover would still be undocumented and would be treated as such by authorities, while also accusing Al Jazeera of fabricating lies and clarified that migrant children were not handcuffed but were instead kept with their parents in detention centres. According to Al Jazeera, Hamzah, Ismail Sabri and their deputies had not responded to requests for interviews. The police have initiated investigations over the Al Jazeera documentary, with Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador saying today that police would be calling up those involved in the documentary for further questioning.

{"title": "Populism or pragmatism? What Bangladesh’s 2026 election means for the economy", "body": "Next year, Bangladeshi voters will head to the polls to not only elect a new government but a chance to build a new path in its economy. This election cycle is shaping up to be policy-heavy with issues such as youth employment, inequality, and development on the table. This election is occurring in the context of an international push back against austerity, free trade, or globalisation in the last decade. In the United States, President Donald Trump has thrown global markets into a frenzy with his tariffs, and in Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has declared the \"end of neo-liberalism\" by rolling out monumental public works projects. With governments taking back control against what they see as an unfair global economic system, is Bangladesh next to follow suit on this trend? Economic populism, or its invocation, is interestingly not as novel in Bangladesh's political history. Nearly every leader and government since independence has professed to be 'populist' to some extent, boasting state-led policies that helped the poor and vulnerable. Of course, this has been far from reality as Bangladesh's economic model has been virtually unchanged since the liberalisation reforms of the late '70s and early '80s. However, contesting parties have now capitalised on this new historical moment by challenging the decades-long status quo with their anti-establishment, environmentalist, and progressive messaging. Candidates have been vocal about the damage of rampant industrialisation on the climate, lack of public spending on education and health, and the unchecked monopoly of the garment industry. In what is a rarity for Bangladeshi elections, the concerns of civil society are translating into mainstream discussions on social and economic policy across the political spectrum. The National Citizens Party (NCP) charter highlights universal healthcare as one of the cornerstones of their campaign, a new and ambitious plan. In a recent post on X, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, stressed the importance of 'green financing' and pulling Bangladesh out of the foreign debt trap via 'strengthening public institutions'. Even Jamaat-e-Islami are marketing themselves as the choice against the excesses of modern capitalism through their support for social welfare and ethical finance. Yet with their sensationalist talk about protecting the climate, public services, domestic industry, or the common worker, their campaign memos fail to detail a fiscal pathway to fund their bold proposals. If anything, they provide a contradictory narrative to their anti-austerity banner. The BNP and NCP for example have conveyed a more private sector-friendly agenda in the form of massive tax holidays, foreign investment incentives, and deregulation which relegates much responsibility to wealthy corporations. Though their plans encourage fair market competition and prioritise businesses to promote 'Environmental, Social, and Governance' (ESG) goals, such pledges are generally shallow Companies around the world often throw away their ESGs, diversity initiatives, and net-zero emission commitments just as anti-pollution regulations, taxes, and employment protections are rolled back. In the end, big business cannot be relied on to regulate itself; it is a strong government with public backing that can be the true change agent. A true populist campaign also scrutinises the dependency on powerful institutions whose trust from the public is eroding; be it developmental aid agencies, lobbyists, multinational conglomerates, or bureaucratic elites. A call to action to fight or reform these elements is missing in this national campaign, this is why their revolutionary appeal feels superficial. Perhaps radical change is not on the way but instead a moderate consensus agreed on by all parties regardless of who takes power — similar to the cross-party postwar consensus in the United Kingdom which emphasised investments in the welfare state and social programs alongside a market economy. But consensus-building still requires putting out your demands first before compromising. The BNP, the NCP, Jamaat, and the rest are pivoting between being against the machine while also relying on it when convenient. Instead of seeking patronage from the top, they must build from the ground up an economic manifesto 'wishlist' that reflects their constituents' needs. Unfortunately no party leader at the moment possesses the fierceness of Trump nor the ideological prowess of Sheinbaum. It is difficult to say if the skills for bipartisanship or popular revolution will be on display when a new government swears next year. Regardless of how the rhetoric in the campaigns of the 2026 election pans out in the coming months, a new outlook is surely on the horizon. Candidates and the general electorate are finally taking into account the much-needed conversation of elevating equity and sustainability in public policy. At the same time, voters should be wary of falling into the usual traps of populism coated with grand promises and lacklustre results. Aamer Tahseen is a New York-based writer and columnist.

Xabi Alonso's side, who had led Barcelona by five points just two rounds ago, now see their advantage reduced to a single point after dropping two more valuable points on the road. The Catalans routed Athletic Bilbao 4-0 on Saturday in their return to the renovated Camp Nou Stadium. Elche opened the scoring in the 53rd minute through Aleix Febas, finishing off a sharp passing move with a low tap-in past Thibaut Courtois. Real equalised in the 78th minute when Dean Huijsen fired home from close range after a corner fell inside the box. But the home side struck again in the 84th minute. Álvaro Rodríguez unleashed a powerful effort from outside the area to restore Elche's lead and put Madrid under pressure once more. Three minutes later, Jude Bellingham rescued the visitors for a second time. His initial effort was parried by goalkeeper Iñaki Peña, but Kylian Mbappé recovered the rebound and squared the ball back for the England midfielder, who converted at the second attempt to secure Real's second equaliser of the night. The Spanish goalkeeper suffered a nose injury during the sequence but continued after receiving brief treatment. In a match filled with missed chances, Elche had the first major opportunity in the 17th minute when Rafa Mir was denied by Courtois from close range. Mbappé later squandered two promising openings for Madrid, and Rodrygo forced a strong save from Peña early in the second half. Real entered the match having beaten Valencia 4-0 earlier this month but followed that result with a 1-0 Champions League loss at Liverpool and a 0-0 La Liga draw with Rayo Vallecano, and extended their winless streak to three matches. After 13 matches, Real sit top of the league on 32 points, with Barcelona close behind on 31.

The new model brings a sharper sensor, impressive burst speeds, and professional-grade video features to stay competitive against Sony and Panasonic. The EOS R6 III comes with a 32.5-megapixel sensor, a major jump from the 24MP chip of its predecessor. This upgrade not only enhances image detail but also enables faster processing with Canon's latest Digic X processor. The camera can shoot at up to 40 frames per second using its electronic shutter, making it a reliable companion for sports and wildlife photography. Autofocus performance has also received a major boost. The Dual Pixel AF system, coupled with Canon's AI-based subject tracking, recognises people, animals, and vehicles, even in low light conditions down to -6 EV. Features like \"Register People Priority,\" borrowed from the higher-end R5 II, help maintain focus on specific faces during dynamic shoots. Video capabilities, however, are where the EOS R6 III truly shines. The camera now supports 7K RAW video at 60 frames per second, along with 4K at 120 fps, offering immense flexibility for filmmakers. With Canon's signature colour profiles, C-Log2 and C-Log3, users can expect cinematic quality straight out of the box.

The club will still have to pay a fine, which has been reduced from €30 million to €10m. City were initially punished by Uefa in February, when they were banned from competing in the Champions League or Europa League for two years and given a €30 million fine for breaching Financial Fair Play rules. In its initial statement confirming City's punishment, Uefa said that it found the Premier League club guilty of \"overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016.\" Uefa's Financial Fair Play regulations aim to maintain the financial health of European football clubs in order to avoid the ruination of teams. This is effectively achieved by limiting the net losses a club is allowed to make over a specified time period. City immediately denied the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB)'s findings and initiated an appeal against the decision at the first opportunity, with club CEO Ferran Soriano emphatically declaring: \"The allegations are not true. They are simply not true.\" Uefa's investigation into the matter was prompted by the publication of a number of allegations by German magazine Der Spiegel, which drew on documents said to have been obtained by whistleblowers Football Leaks, in 2018. Animosity has been bubbling between the Premier League giants and European football's governing body for almost a decade now, and the latest clash has further strained the relationship.

{"title": "Fauci calls White House criticism of him bizarre, says 'let's stop this nonsense' and fight coronavirus", "body": "US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Wednesday called the White House effort to discredit him \"bizarre\" and urged an end to the divisiveness over the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic, saying \"let's stop this nonsense.\" Fauci, who has become a popular and trusted figure during the coronavirus outbreak, came under criticism from President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies as Fauci cautioned against reopening the US economy too soon. The recent spike in coronavirus infections, primarily in states that were among the earliest to lift coronavirus restrictions, put Fauci on a collision course with the White House. \"One of the things that's part of the problem is the dynamics of the divisiveness that is going on now that it becomes difficult to engage in a dialogue of honest evaluation of what's gone right and what's gone wrong,\" Fauci told The Atlantic in an interview. \"We've got to own this, reset this and say OK, let's stop this nonsense and figure out how can we get our control over this now.\" The White House over the weekend distributed a list of statements Fauci made early in the pandemic that turned out to be wrong as understanding of the disease developed, according to media reports. Trump said this week he valued Fauci's input but did not always agree with him. \"You know, it is a bit bizarre. I don't really fully understand it,\" Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic. He said he believed the people involved in releasing that list, which was misleading because it did not include the entirety of Fauci's statements or other context, are really \"taken aback by what a big mistake that was.\" White House tensions with Fauci have risen with the decline of Trump's popularity in opinion polls over the president's handling of the outbreak. The Republican president, who is seeking re-election in November, has been increasingly critical of government health officials and their guidance as a rise in infections threatens the easing of shutdown restrictions across the country. Across the country, new cases are now averaging around 60,000 a day. The White House has denied that Fauci has been sidelined. However, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro wrote a critical opinion piece attacking Fauci for having made mistakes. Before departing for a trip to Atlanta, Trump was asked whether Navarro had gone rogue. \"Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that. No, I have a very good relationship with Anthony,\" Trump said. Fauci told the Atlantic: \"I can't explain Peter Navarro. He's in a world by himself. So I don't even want to go there.\" Fauci said in a Financial Times interview last week he had not briefed Trump in two months. He said on Wednesday his advice is passed onto Trump indirectly, via Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force. In his Atlantic interview, Fauci recommended the country hit a reset button and acknowledge that things are not going in the right direction. The rising numbers of coronavirus infections show \"we've got to do better\" and states need to get on the same page and work on ways to control the virus. \"So, rather than these games people are playing, let's focus on that,\" Fauci said.

{"title": "Ads for England-West Indies series ‘better than Ashes’", "body": "Almost four months after a One-day International between Australia and New Zealand at an empty stadium in Sydney, international cricket restarts in Southampton on Wednesday with the England-West Indies Test series. Live football is back but cricket stays the most-watched sport in India. According to a 2019 report by the Broadcast Audience Research Council, cricket got 58 per cent of viewing minutes of live broadcast across sports channels. So it fits that advertisers and sponsors would welcome resumption even if it is behind closed doors. The three-Test series in England already has three co-presenting sponsors, six associate sponsors and two more companies who have bought ad spots for the India broadcast. More are in the works. \"We Indians love cricket and live cricket is coming back after 120 days. There is already a massive interest around the series and advertisers are also responding to it very positively,\" says Rohit Gupta CRO - Ad Sales and International Business, Sony Pictures Networks India, the official broadcasters. What's unusual is that this is for a series that does not involve India. Sony bought the media rights from England cricket board for five years (2018-22) for an undisclosed sum but the majority of its value would be for the three India tours during this period. \"For every India match overseas, it's estimated an Indian broadcaster pays $5 million. Non-India cricket comes practically free,\" says a leading industry executive who did not wish to be named. Among series that don't involve India, Ashes is the most attractive property. Sony holds the rights for cricket in England and Australia. \"For non-India cricket, we haven't seen anything like this in the past and this is even better than what we get for the Ashes series,\" says Gupta. With no clarity on when cricket - the cash-rich Indian Premier League included - will start in India and the Virat Kohli's team not scheduled to travel to Australia before December, two months of non-stop international action in England (the West Indies tour will be followed by Pakistan) has led to a spike in interest. Also, for fantasy gaming platforms live cricket is good news. \"Both the West Indies and Pakistan series in England provides us with visibility. So, we will look to extend our association for both,\" says Avik Kanungo, director at Games 24x7, whose My11Circle is one of the co-presenting sponsors for the series. \"We have seen in the past, even for non-India matches, the interest in fantasy gaming is very good.

{"title": "Beyond mobile money: Is Bangladesh ready for the next phase of fintech?", "body": "In the history of Bangladesh's economy, some changes are clearly visible in factories, bridges, and power plants. Others unfold quietly, shaping people's everyday habits. Fintech belongs to this latter category of silent transformation. Just a decade ago, banking meant standing in long queues at urban branches; today, a simple mobile phone has become the primary gateway for financial transactions. This shift is not merely technological; it carries deep implications for the structure of the economy, the distribution of economic power, and the country's future growth trajectory. Fintech, or financial technology, broadly refers to the use of technology to simplify, accelerate, and enhance the inclusivity of financial services. Globally, the rise of fintech has been a response to the limitations of traditional banking systems. Bangladesh has followed a similar path. After independence, the country developed a largely state-owned, bank-centric financial system. Over time, inefficiency, a culture of loan default, and an urban bias in service delivery meant that this system failed to meet the needs of ordinary citizens. Rural communities, women, and small entrepreneurs were effectively left outside the formal banking net. It is within this vacuum that fintech gradually found its footing. The most visible success of Bangladesh's fintech industry is undoubtedly the mobile financial services (MFS). bKash, Nagad, and Rocket are now household names across the country. bKash, launched with the support of BRAC Bank, has grown into Bangladesh's first and only fintech unicorn. Nagad, a digital initiative of the Bangladesh Post Office, plays a critical role in everyday transactions as well as in the distribution of government allowances. Rocket, pioneered by Dutch-Bangla Bank, was among the earliest MFS platforms to pave the way for digital banking. Alongside them, platforms such as Upay, Dmoney, and SureCash serve specific segments and use cases, enriching the broader ecosystem. Statistics underscore the scale of this transformation. Bangladesh is now among the world's leading countries in MFS adoption. As of October 2024, more than 230 million MFS accounts had been registered. In fiscal year 2023-24, transactions through MFS exceeded Tk15 trillion. These figures represent more than technological progress; they signal a fundamental shift in financial behaviour. Garment workers' wages, remittance inflows from expatriates, and farmers' sales proceeds are increasingly flowing through digital channels. Alongside the success of MFS, the digital payments ecosystem has expanded rapidly. Payment gateways such as SSLCommerz, AmarPay, ShurjoPay, and LebuPay have created a strong foundation for e-commerce and the SME sector. Nearly 700,000 merchants now accept QR-code-based payments. In urban areas, online and contactless transactions have become part of everyday life. Dependence on cash is gradually declining, leaving behind digital transaction trails that are crucial for tax collection and financial transparency. Yet behind this visible progress lie deeper structural questions. The first is whether the expansion of digital transactions is translating into higher investment and production. The reality is sobering. Private investment growth has remained below expectations in recent years. At the same time, the government's growing reliance on bank borrowing has constrained credit availability for the private sector. Increased government borrowing from banks has created a \"crowding out\" effect, limiting resources for businesses and entrepreneurs. In such a context, if fintech remains confined to facilitating transactions alone, its long-term economic impact will be limited. This is where digital lending and fintech-based credit solutions emerge as a potentially transformative force. Initiatives such as Shadhin FinTech, ShopUp's digital credit model, and iFarmer's invoice-based financing are opening alternative funding channels for SMEs and small entrepreneurs. Artificial intelligence-based credit scoring and the use of alternative data have made it possible to extend loans without relying solely on formal credit histories. In Bangladesh, digital lending and invoice factoring are growing at an estimated annual rate of around 30%, reflecting strong unmet demand. Even so, these opportunities come with significant risks. Without clear and robust regulations, digital lending can easily become a source of high interest rates, opaque terms, and consumer exploitation. Experiences from neighbouring countries show that unregulated digital credit can trigger social distress. Innovation in this sector must therefore go hand in hand with strong consumer protection and transparent oversight. InsurTech and WealthTech remain relatively nascent in Bangladesh but hold considerable promise. Digital insurance platforms can simplify health and life risk management, while WealthTech solutions can draw young and middle-income groups into formal investment channels. Yet here too, low levels of financial literacy and limited trust pose major barriers. Technology alone cannot deliver solutions; credible institutions and effective regulatory frameworks are essential. Within this evolving ecosystem, Bangladesh Bank plays a pivotal role. The central bank has laid important foundations through MFS guidelines, the interoperable digital transaction platform \"Binimoy,\" Bangla QR, the National Payment Switch Bangladesh, and the launch of the national debit card \"TakaPay.\" The Regulatory FinTech Facilitation Office and sandbox initiatives have sent positive signals to innovators. Still, gaps remain. Digital lending, data privacy, and cross-border payments lack a coherent, forward-looking policy roadmap. Data protection and cybersecurity have emerged as some of the most pressing challenges facing fintech. As digital transactions grow, so do the risks of fraud and data misuse. Yet Bangladesh's data protection laws and enforcement mechanisms remain weak by international standards. Trust is the cornerstone of any financial system, and without it, fintech cannot be sustainable. This is a reality policymakers must urgently confront. Another critical issue is the digital divide. Disparities between urban and rural areas and between educated and less-educated populations remain stark. Limited access to smartphones, affordable internet, and financial knowledge continues to exclude many from the digital revolution. If fintech is to be genuinely inclusive, priority must be given to infrastructure development, affordable connectivity, and large-scale financial literacy programmes. International experience offers valuable lessons. Fintech ecosystems reach maturity only when interoperability and open banking are firmly in place. India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) now processes billions of transactions each month. China has integrated payments, commerce, and social platforms through Alipay and WeChat Pay. Bangladesh is moving in this direction, but bolder decisions are needed, particularly to simplify international payment gateways, remittance flows, and cross-border transfers. Fintech presents Bangladesh with both opportunity and obligation. If it remains confined to moving money faster, its economic impact will be modest. But if backed by clear policy, strong regulation, and a deliberate link to investment, productivity, and job creation, fintech can reshape how growth is financed and shared. The shifts now visible in 2025 from telco-led financial services, such as Banglalink's expanding role to deeper integration between payments, credit, and everyday commerce, suggest that the industry is entering a more consequential phase. Whether this momentum translates into broad-based economic value will depend on choices made today. The real question is no longer whether fintech will grow in Bangladesh, but whether it will grow in a way that strengthens the economy rather than merely digitising its transactions.

World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization, released a report today titled \"Aftershocks: Out of Time\" after conducting rapid assessments in 24 countries across Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. \"Child protection must take centre stage as families' incomes plummet due to aftershocks of the Covid-19 outbreak,\" World Vision says in its findings. An estimated 85 million families across Asia are living with little or no food stocks and 110 million children are going hungry, reads a press release. The aid agency also warns that global predictions of increased child hunger, violence and poverty due to the economic impact of COVID-19 are already starting to come true. Children are reporting increased isolation as families' incomes reduce – triggering stress among parents and caregivers as they cope with the impact of Covid-19, according to the report. Chandan Gomes, Interim Director of World Vision Bangladesh, said a rapid assessment conducted in the country indicated that 87 percent of children are stressed and another 87 percent are worried due to a decrease in family income in the wake of the Covid-19 shutdown. \"Children, lactating and pregnant women are the most vulnerable as families adopt reduced meal intakes as a coping mechanism.\" In the study, World Vision collected data from 14,000 households in Asia, over 2,400 small business owners in Africa, and more than 360 Venezuelan migrants across Latin America. This community-level data confirms that projections by global agencies about the potential impact of the pandemic are already happening. World Vision's Partnership Leader for Global Impact Norbert Hsu said, \"It is often the most vulnerable families and their children who are hardest hit; those living in fragile countries already suffering from conflict, climate change, instability or displacement, and those who are relying on humanitarian assistance.\" The organisation raised a global call to governments, UN agencies, donors, NGOs, and the private sector to act together to combat the deadly impacts of Covid-19 pandemic. The actions include scaling-up child-sensitive social protection programmes; keeping food and market systems going; protecting jobs and livelihoods now; and investing in an inclusive, resilient and green economic recovery.

{"title": "Emerging markets are going to pay the price again", "body": "Judging by the performance of emerging markets, you'd hardly know the world was suffering from a deadly pandemic. After a horrible March, according to the Institute for International Finance, non-resident portfolio flows into emerging markets increased tenfold to $32.9 billion in June. MSCI's EM currency index hit a one-month high last Thursday. Even currencies as weak as the South African rand are seeing a bit of a rally. Of course, that doesn't mean things are going well in developing nations themselves. If anything, many of them face longer and more troublesome recoveries than was anticipated at the depth of the market panic in March. Earnings aren't expected to recover anytime soon. Here in India, the ratio of price to one-year forward earnings for stocks in the Nifty50 index is the highest it has been for a decade. Behind this decoupling of markets and Main Street lies a familiar culprit: rich-world central banks. As they did after the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan have pumped massive amounts of liquidity into their domestic markets. Those markets have rallied as intended and domestic investors, terrified at the prospect of missing out, have piled in. That in turn has forced institutional investors to search for yield in emerging markets. If the entire process is disconnected from reality, that's by design. The very purpose of unconventional monetary policy is to impose irrationality on markets. Market insiders take this disconnect for granted; as Ajay Kumar of Bank of America Securities told Bloomberg TV, \"sentiment and liquidity account for the bulk of your returns\" at times like these. But the rest of the world doesn't. And they're right not to do so because, the last time this happened, emerging markets wound up badly damaged by the monetary policy of developed nations. Yes, the Fed and others have done well to reverse the near-catastrophic outflows of capital from emerging markets that were visible in the early weeks of the pandemic. Though it wasn't their intent, their actions helped EMs raise, by early June, more than $83 billion on global bond markets. But, emerging markets should have learned by now that this is a poisoned chalice. Over the medium- and long-term, the West's money printing will burden the developing world with volatility, instability, and subdued growth and investment. Consider India's experience. In the years after 2008, the country enjoyed a sharp liquidity- and stimulus-driven rebound. But then commodity prices shot up. That increased inflation, drained foreign-exchange reserves and caused inflationary expectations to drift up unanchored. Asset-price inflation caused endless pain domestically; real estate prices, for example, shot up so high that the market is still not working properly. And, worst of all, cheap liquidity led to indiscriminate lending and a bad-loan crisis that has crippled Indian growth and investment. Nor were we masters of our own fate: In the infamous taper tantrum, a word from former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke drove the Indian rupee down to record lows. The Fed's actions had political consequences as well, as voters took out their anger on the hapless incumbent government. Naturally, this process won't unfold the same way twice. The driver won't be oil prices this time, and perhaps not real estate. All we can say for certain is that something of the sort will indeed happen again. All that liquidity will have to settle somewhere and it will probably wind up flowing to whichever real asset is seen as being scarcest and most future-proofed on the margin. Rare earths, perhaps, in our new digital world? The fact that share prices and currency indices are so detached from reality is the surest sign that the process is underway. These are the first conduits through which the irrationality of central bank actions elsewhere begins to affect emerging economies. The MSCI index of EM equities has had a great quarter but remember, the last time it had such a good quarter was 2009. Inevitably, the combination of unrestrained liquidity and a crisis mentality will weaken already fragile governance structures in both financial markets and the real economy. Central banks in the West have been warned of this often. Raghuram Rajan, who as governor of the Reserve Bank of India had to deal with the consequences for India of unconventional monetary policy elsewhere, has constantly argued for setting \"rules of the game\" for central banks so that they don't destabilize emerging markets. Rajan makes a simple, if under-appreciated point: \"The bottom line is that simply because a policy is called monetary, unconventional or otherwise, it may not be beneficial on net for the world.\" The failure to learn the lessons of the last stimulus may now doom emerging markets to another decade of subpar growth and political instability.

Agreeing that the charges of rape, cheating and intimidation against the petitioner were serious in nature, the court observed that \"seriousness alone is not the criteria to deny liberty to the citizen when there is no prima facie case from the police.\" The court took note of a letter allegedly written by the complainant that she would withdraw the complaint if a compromise was brought about. \"Nothing is stated by the complainant as to why she did not approach the court at the earliest point of time when the petitioner was allegedly forcing her for sexual favours,\" the court observed. Further, the judge also found no ground to deny the accused advance bail as the victim did not offer any explanation for not alerting the police or the public about the conduct of the petitioner when she had been to a hotel for dinner and the petitioner, having consumed drinks, came and sat in the car.

The agency did not specify the origin of the oil being transferred. The waters off Malaysia are known as a regular site for illegal ship-to-ship transfers, where oil is shifted between tankers at sea to obscure its origin. Malaysian authorities said in July last year they would more tightly enforce rules around the practice. The seized tankers, worth 718 million ringgit, were carrying 53 Chinese, Burmese, Iranian, Pakistani and Indian crew members. The two captains of the ships were arrested and handed over to Penang state maritime investigation officials, the agency said. Maritime Captain Muhammad Suffi Mohd Ramli said the tankers at anchor were inspected after a patrol boat received a complaint at about 1 am local time on Thursday. The ships were found in a coupled position and suspected of carrying out transfer activities. The captain added that the tankers are being investigated for anchoring without permission, which carries a penalty of 100,000 ringgit, and carrying out illegal ship-to-ship transfer activities, which carries a penalty of 200,000 ringgit per vessel.

Institutions like the World Bank often come with many project proposals. If some are genuinely high priority, we may consider them. But these issues are now being discussed and assessed very carefully,\" he told reporters after an ECNEC meeting. The adviser said the government will accept loan-funded projects only if they are of critical national priority and cannot be financed or implemented with domestic resources or expertise. He noted that some initiatives, such as pollution monitoring, do not justify large loans or foreign consultants. \"Measuring pollution is not that difficult. The instruments involved are not extraordinarily complex. There is no need to take large foreign loans for such purposes,\" he said. He added that as Bangladesh prepares for LDC graduation, interest rates on foreign loans are rising, making them more expensive and underscored the importance of relying on domestic capacity. The adviser also warned against attractive but unnecessary projects offered by multilateral lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \"We will take only those loan projects that are truly necessary, where foreign support is genuinely required. Everything else should be done with our own resources, even if on a smaller scale,\" he said. He also highlighted the government's intention to reduce long-standing dependence on loans in social sectors, including education. \"There is no point in becoming trapped in a vicious cycle of debt.

{"title": "Google's Gemini 3 and Antigravity: The new era of AI intelligence", "body": "Just imagine a world where a non-developer can build a wonderful app that serves millions of people. On 18 November, Google CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled the new version of Google's generative AI, Gemini 3. They call it the most advanced AI model to date. With Gemini 3, anyone can learn even complicated topics using advanced visualisation and comprehensive learning techniques. Google claims it is the \"New Era of Intelligence.\" Gemini 3 is rolling out for general users, software professionals and developers even entrepreneurs. General users can access from the Gemini App, and for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers in AI Mode in Search, entrepreneurs can use it via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise (Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified and fully-managed platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models). Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, and Koray Kavukcuoglu, CTO of Google DeepMind and chief AI architect at Google, are the visionaries consistently improving Gemini every year. Google also released a new coding platform called Antigravity, the most powerful vibe coding agent right now. Gemini 3 includes agentic features, meaning anyone can build complicated software and applications from just a prompt. However, Antigravity marks a new era for non-developers. Unlike other AI chatbots that only exist on screen and ask questions, Antigravity has groundbreaking features. It can understand existing code, interpret what developers are trying to build, and generate the code for them. Antigravity can also test the code and detect problems without human intervention. It is the new era for developing own applications/tools. Gemini 3 is the most powerful reasoning AI tool yet and excels at spatial reasoning (understanding layouts, trajectories), which is especially useful in robotics and augmented reality (AR). It supports 1,000,000 tokens of content and can deliver outputs of up to 640,000 tokens. The new search integration sets another benchmark for the Google ecosystem. While Gemini 2.5 could build heavily optimised generative images and videos, Gemini 3 can produce even more feasible generative images. Gemini 3 is also extremely powerful for reasoning, analysis, and analytics. According to Google, Gemini 3 Pro maintains consistent tool usage and decision-making for a full simulated year of operation, delivering higher returns without drifting off-task. Google has also introduced Gemini 3 Deep Think, with enhanced reasoning capabilities and improved performance. Deep Think achieved 41% on Humanity's Last Exam without tools. It can analyse any data quickly and accurately, making it a powerful assistant for data analysts. Deep Think will only be available to Google AI Ultra subscribers. Although Gemini offers a free model, the most advanced features are available only in the paid models: Google AI Pro ($20 per month) and Google AI Ultra ($250 per month). google / Google AI / gemini", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/googles-gemini-3-and-antigravity-new-era-ai-intelligence-1303866", "date": "2025-12-07T19:05:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 07 December, 2025, 07:05 pm Last modified: 07 December, 2025, 07:20 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 453, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:29:31.214705"}

Two routes will be used for the movement of goods. Once the transhipment begins, India will be able to transport goods to its northeastern states very quickly. Chittagong Port Authority and Chattogram Custom House have already completed preparations for that. For the first trial run, MV Shejyoti ship with a capacity of 365 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) will sail from Chittagong Port for Syama Prasad Mukherjee Port – formerly Kolkata Port – on Sunday (July 12). It will set for Chittagong Port on July 16 with four TEUs of container goods. Then the goods will be transported by road to India via Cumilla's Bibir Bazar-Srimantpur and Agartala. Another route that will be used for transhipment is Chittagong Port to Agartala via Akhaura. Chittagong Port Authority Chairman Rear Admiral SM Abul Kalam Azad told The Business Standard that the first trial run of transhipment of Indian goods will begin on July 16. \"It was supposed to start last March but got delayed due to Covid-19.\" Also, a memorandum of understanding signed by Under Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways SK Geeva, on July 8, states that the first trial run of the transhipment will take place on July 16. Yakub Bhuiyan Sujan, managing director of MV Shejyoti's agent Mango Line, told The Business Standard that the first trial run of the Indian transhipment will be done through MV Shejyoti. \"We have already made all the preparations. But I will get to know the details of the products later.\" Chattogram Custom House will collect seven types of tariffs on Indian goods. A letter sent from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh to the High Commission of India in Dhaka, on July 5, set the tariffs. However, the fees for using roads in line with the policy of the Road Transport and Highways Division has been exempted from the first trial run. The charges including document processing fee will be Tk30 per consignment, transhipment fee Tk20 per metric tonne, security charge Tk100 per metric tonne, escort charge Tk50 per metric tonne, other administrative charges Tk100, container scanning fee Tk254 per container, and electric lock and seal fee will be charged as per rules, according to the letter. Chattogram Custom House Commissioner Mohammad Fakhrul Alam told The Business Standard that tariffs on Indian goods would be levied as per government directives. In October 2018, India and Bangladesh signed an agreement for the use of Chattogram and Mongla ports for transhipment of goods to India's northeastern states. Earlier, the Standard Operating Procedures to allow transhipment of Indian goods to its landlocked northeastern states was agreed upon during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Delhi in October 2019.

{"title": "Instagram shows more ‘eating disorder adjacent’ content to vulnerable teens, research shows", "body": "Meta researchers found that teens who report that Instagram regularly made them feel bad about their bodies saw significantly more \"eating disorder adjacent content\" than those who did not, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. The posts shown to those users featured \"prominent display\" of chest, buttocks, or thighs, \"explicit judgment\" about body types and \"content related to disordered eating and/or negative body image.\" While such material is not banned on Instagram, the researchers noted that parents, teens and outside experts have told Meta they believe it is potentially harmful to young users. Meta surveyed 1,149 teens over the course of the 2023-2024 academic year about whether and how often they felt bad about their bodies after using Instagram. Then they manually sampled the content that those users saw on the platform over three months. The study showed that for the 223 teens who often felt bad about their bodies after viewing Instagram, \"eating disorder adjacent content\" made up 10.5% of what they saw on the platform. Among the other teens in the study, such content accounted for only 3.3% of what they saw. \"Teens who reported frequent body dissatisfaction after viewing posts on Instagram… saw about three times more body-focused/ED-adjacent content than other teens,\" the authors wrote, referring to eating disorders, according to a summary of the research reviewed exclusively by Reuters. In addition to seeing more eating disorder-adjacent content, researchers found, the teens who reported the most negative feelings about themselves saw more provocative content more broadly, content Meta classifies as \"mature themes,\" \"Risky behavior,\" \"Harm & Cruelty\" and \"Suffering.\" Cumulatively, such content accounted for 27% of what those teens saw on the platform, compared with 13.6% among their peers who hadn't reported negative feelings. Meta researchers expressed concerns The researchers stressed that their findings did not prove that Instagram was making users feel worse about their bodies. \"It is not possible to establish the causal direction of these findings,\" they wrote, noting the possibility that teens who felt bad about themselves could be actively seeking out that material. The Instagram research, a redacted replica of which is published here and has not been previously reported, demonstrated that Instagram exposed teens who \"report frequently experiencing body dissatisfaction\" to high doses of content that Meta's own advisors \"have expressed support for limiting,\" the write-up said. In a statement, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said the document reviewed by Reuters demonstrates Meta's commitment to understanding and improving its products. \"This research is further proof we remain committed to understanding young people's experiences and using those insights to build safer, more supportive platforms for teens,\" Stone said, noting the company's recent announcement that it would attempt to show minors content in line with PG-13 movie standards. In the study, Meta said that its existing screening tools - which were designed to catch violations of platform rules - were incapable of detecting 98.5% of the \"sensitive\" content that the company believes might not have been appropriate for teens. The finding was \"not necessarily surprising,\" the researchers wrote, because Meta had only recently begun work on building an algorithm to detect the potentially harmful content they were examining. 'Association' between content and 'Feeling worse about one's body' The study, which is marked, \"Do not distribute internally or externally without permission,\" is the latest internal research that demonstrates an \"association\" between viewing fashion, beauty and fitness content and \"reporting feeling worse about one's body,\" the document states. The research was conducted as part of Meta's efforts to understand interactions between users and its own products, which rely on algorithms to determine which content to show to users. In the United States, the company has faced state and federal investigations of Instagram's effects on children, as well as civil suits by school districts alleging harmful product design and deceptive marketing of its platforms as safe for teens. Those suits have prominently cited past leaked internal research from Meta in which researchers expressed their belief that the platform's content recommendations might be harmful to youth with existing body image issues. Since July of this year, Stone said, the company has reduced the amount of age-restricted content shown to teenage Instagram users by half. Content warranted trigger warning Jenny Radesky, a University of Michigan Associate Professor of Paediatrics who reviewed Meta's unreleased research at Reuters' request, called the study's methodology robust and its findings disturbing. \"This supports the idea that teens with psychological vulnerabilities are being profiled by Instagram and fed more harmful content,\" Radesky said. \"We know that a lot of what people consume on social media comes from the feed, not from search.\" Past internal research at Meta \"has demonstrated an association between frequency of reporting feeling worse about one's body\" and consuming Instagram fitness and beauty content, the writeup says. Meta's researchers wrote that teens, parents, pediatricians, external advisors and Meta's own Eating Disorder & Body Image Advisory Council have urged Instagram to limit how much of that content it shows to teenagers, warning that it \"may be detrimental to teen well-being, specifically by precipitating or exacerbating feelings of body dissatisfaction.\" Such content falls afoul of Meta's rules against content that overtly promotes eating disorders. The report included samples of problematic content, including images of skinny women in lingerie and bikinis, fight videos and a drawing of a crying figure scrawled with phrases including \"how could I ever compare\" and \"make it all end.\" One of the example posts showed a close-up of a woman's lacerated neck. Though the content did not violate Meta's rules, the researchers found it disturbing enough that they issued a \"sensitive content\" warning to colleagues reading their work.

{"title": "Mobile manufacturers accuse NEIR protesters of blocking opening of authorised shops", "body": "Mobile phone manufacturers have alleged that protesting handset traders are preventing the opening of authorised showrooms, outlets that exclusively sell locally produced mobile phones of foreign brands, as demonstrations continue against the government's National Equipment Identity Register (NEIR) programme. Manufacturers have also accused protesters of assaulting showroom staff who attempted to open outlets. According to Xiaomi officials, the situation has forced around 100 showrooms of various foreign brands across the country to remain closed for several days. The Bangladesh China Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCCI) warned that if the situation continues, it could damage Bangladesh's image abroad and discourage foreign investment. In a statement issued yesterday, the chamber said, \"Legal mobile phone retail outlets across various parts of the country have been forcibly shut down, while mobs have carried out acts of vandalism.\" \"As a result, local smartphone manufacturers have been suffering from severe financial and mental distress, and smartphone manufacturing factories are now on the verge of shutdown,\" the statement said. China is a major source of foreign investment in Bangladesh's mobile phone handset manufacturing and assembling sector, industry insiders said. The Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) also condemned the vandalism. In a statement signed by FICCI's Executive Director TIM Nurul Kabir, it called for legal action and enhanced security for lawful mobile handset businesses. Xiaomi outlets remain shut Ziauddin Chowdhury, country manager of Xiaomi Bangladesh, told The Business Standard that the company's showrooms have been unable to operate normally since the start of the protests. \"When we tried to open our showrooms at Jamuna Future Park in the capital, they were forcibly kept closed. Showroom staff were assaulted,\" he said. Xiaomi has 12 showrooms at Jamuna Future Park, but since 1 January they have been able to open for only two days, Ziauddin said. A similar situation has prevailed at Bashundhara City Shopping Complex, where the showrooms were open for just one day during the same period. \"Besides this, we[Xiaomi], including Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, have had to keep nearly 100 showrooms closed in Dhaka, Chattogram and other parts of the country. The situation was the same on Thursday as well,\" he added. Foreign investment concerns According to BCCCI, Bangladesh's mobile phone industry has grown into a strong and established sector, with 18 manufacturing plants currently in operation. At least four of these involve foreign investment, with total investments exceeding Tk3,000 crore. In the statement signed by BCCCI President Khorshed Alam, the chamber said, \"We strongly condemn these violent and reprehensible acts targeting foreign-invested manufacturing enterprises.\" \"We urge the relevant government authorities to take immediate and appropriate legal action against those responsible, ensure the security of legitimate business establishments, and safeguard an overall conducive business environment,\" it said. Protest leaders deny allegations However, leaders behind the recent NEIR protests have denied the allegations.

Another 3,027 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours till 8am on Tuesday, taking the number of infections in the country to 1,68,645. Thirty-nine Covid-19 patients died in different hospitals and 15 at their respective homes and one on the way to hospital. Professor Dr Nasima Sultana, additional director general of the Directorate General of Health Services, made the announcement during a virtual briefing on Tuesday. \"Of the deceased, 46 were men and nine were women, and 27 of them were from Dhaka, 12 from Chattogram, seven from Khulna, two each from Barishal, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet, one from Mymensingh divisions,\" she added.

{"title": "Bangladesh cannot escape fragility without dismantling 'loot and plunder economy': Expert", "body": "Former chairman of the Development Studies Department at Dhaka University, Professor Mahbubullah, today (8 December) stressed that Bangladesh's persistent economic fragility cannot be overcome without establishing a genuine balance of power within society and dismantling what he described as a long-running \"loot and plunder economy.\" Speaking at the seminar on the publications \"Bangladesh State of the Economy 2025\" and \"Sustainable Development Goals: Bangladesh Progress Report 2025\" at the National Economic Council (NEC) Conference Room of the Planning Commission in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, the eminent economist said that the country has been stuck in a cycle of wealth accumulation since 16 December 1971—an economic structure he argued continues to distort incentives, hinder productive growth, and sustain inequality. He said that despite adopting numerous policies and reforms, Bangladesh has failed to achieve sustainable outcomes because \"economic extraction and redistribution of wealth from one set of hands to another\" remain deeply embedded in the system. \"Unless we end this continuous reshuffling of wealth, real productive growth will remain elusive,\" he cautioned. \"Unless we transition to a production-based economy, the country's growth will remain vulnerable and uneven,\" he added. Professor Mahbubullah underscored that meaningful economic reforms, including those relating to governance, investment, and market functioning, cannot take root unless the social and political power structure is rebalanced. \"We talk about democracy and good governance, but neither will materialise as long as this accumulation process continues. A fair distribution of power across society is the precondition for a functional economy,\" he said, adding that without such a foundation, reforms risk remaining superficial. Turning to inflation, the economist expressed doubt about the country's ability to bring price pressures under control within the next one to three years. He argued that supply bottlenecks, limited productive capacity, and a large demand burden—partly driven by population growth—make a quick recovery unlikely. \"Inflation cannot be tamed while commodity supply remains insufficient compared to money supply. Production must rise, but investment is stagnant. Without new investment, expanding supply in the short term is impossible,\" he said. He also pointed to the effects of high government expenditure and increased liquidity injected into the economy, which have exacerbated the imbalance between money circulation and commodity circulation. Concern over 'sluggish and depressed' investment environment Professor Mahbubullah expressed deep concern over what he termed a \"sluggish and depressed\" investment environment, warning that Bangladesh's productive base is not expanding fast enough to absorb labour or support stable long-term growth. He noted that while readymade garments and foreign remittances remain the two primary pillars of the economy, other promising sectors—such as pharmaceuticals, ceramics, and light engineering—have not been able to scale up due to structural constraints and unfavourable incentives. \"A proper incentive structure across fiscal, monetary and planning policies is yet to be formulated. Without it, investors cannot be expected to take risks or expand production,\" he added. Describing the prevailing economic order as one driven by extraction rather than production, he said that wealth continues to be generated and redistributed through rent-seeking, misuse of state power, and distortive incentives, rather than productive investment. \"This loot and plunder economy has existed under every government for 54 years—sometimes more intensely, sometimes less—but we have never truly escaped it,\" he said. He emphasised that addressing inequality, understanding the dynamics of the informal economy, and strengthening governance are essential steps for shifting towards a productive and inclusive growth model. investment / development", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/bangladesh-cannot-escape-fragility-without-dismantling-loot-and-plunder-economy-expert", "date": "2025-12-08T13:35:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 08 December, 2025, 01:35 pm Last modified: 08 December, 2025, 01:41 pm", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 561, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:29:49.354661"}

{"title": "Why police are videotaping narco raids", "body": "Autorickshaw driver Jony Mia had been transporting passengers at Bijoynagar town as usual on June 8. In the afternoon, he came across a police check post and his passenger was found transporting six kilograms of hemp. Police video recorded the seizure and obtained the signature of the autorickshaw driver on the record. Jony was frightened as the police filmed the incident and took still pictures of it on their mobile phones. He grew calmer when the law enforcement officials told him that the pictures and videos would be used to strengthen the narcotics case against the passenger and Jony would only have to testify about what he had seen. \"Videotaping the raid and the witnesses was good as I also want drug smugglers to be punished. I will testify about what I saw before the court,\" he said. Like this incident, police in Brahmanbaria bordering India have been video recording the anti-drug raids in a bid to decrease the court's backlog. Police officials in the district said they were taking the footage so that the witnesses do not fall back to testify before the court and the raids remain transparent. Brahmanbaria police sources said trials of narcotics cases take too long as the witnesses often do not turn up at courts – while many cases are resolved due to the lack of witnesses and evidence. Additionally, allegations run rife against some police personnel over evidence tampering. In some incidents, law enforcement members were found to be stealing drugs the raids had recovered. Brahmanbaria police took the video-recording step in the wake of such recurring issues. Field level police members are now sending video clips along with case dockets to the police's top brass. The district police are scheduled to submit those digital documents alongside the case documents to court from July. Police said this will stop witnesses getting away by telling the court that he or she was not at the scene during the raid. Bijoynagar police Officer-in-Charge (OC) Atiqur Rahman said, \"In many cases, the drug smugglers manage the witnesses and they [witnesses] tell the court that they know nothing or were not at the spot when the raid was conducted. This helps the smugglers get away with the crime.\" Moreover, the OC said that many raise questions over the seizures. Therefore, the higher-ups have asked the field officials to take pictures and record video footage. Brahmanbaria Additional Superintendent of Police Abu Sayeed said digital evidence will help the trials and make the raids more transparent. \"So far the measure seems effective and fruitful,\" he added. However, Barrister Jyotirmoy Barua – a leading human rights lawyer – believes police cannot insist that someone testify. \"Since the legal framework does not allow police to do that, the laws have to be amended first if they want to add digital evidence to narcotics cases,\" he noted. Record in per-day narcotics cases Even the pandemic has failed to thwart drug smuggling as the contraband consignments are making their way in the country. The first two months of this year have seen more narcotics cases than the previous year – 351 a day on average. The Department of Narcotics Control said in 2019, 340 narcotics cases were filed per day on average. In narcotics cases, 1.62 lakh people were arrested last year while 27,372 people were arrested in just the first two months of this year. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says seized drugs are only 10 percent of the total drugs smuggled in a year. According to the hypothesis, more than 30 crore yaba pills, worth Tk4,500 crore, were sold in Bangladesh in 2019.

{"title": "Homes can shelter India’s China dream after Covid", "body": "India quite literally needs to put a roof over its China dream. It took a pandemic and a lockdown to highlight the precarious existence of the country's blue-collar workers. Left without jobs and shelter, an estimated 30 million — roughly a fifth of the urban labor force — have gone back to their villages, with many completing long, hazardous journeys on foot when trains and buses shut down. No wonder, then, that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government cleared a plan this week to build inexpensive rental dwellings in cities for 350,000 workers. Giving rural migrants an incentive to return is crucial to restoring economic activity to pre-Covid levels. But there's an opportunity here to do much more. For India to industrialize, rethinking the housing situation will be as important as freeing the urban poor from large medical bills and helping them build retirement savings. If the country of 1.3 billion people wants to be a factory to the world — the next China — it must start by giving workers low-cost living quarters. India is sitting on an inventory of more than 1.3 million unsold homes. Mumbai-based property researcher Liases Foras estimates that roughly half of these units could face delays and other execution risk; prices on nearly nine out of 10 apartments may have to be cut by 5% to 15% to hook wary buyers. That's billions of dollars in lost revenue. It may not be possible to repurpose this stock as worker accommodation. Nevertheless, as losses on pricey condominiums crystallize for struggling developers and stretched financiers, they can be made more bearable by tax breaks, cheap government land and other fiscal support for affordable rental housing — a new revenue stream. Assured of a decent rental yield, investors will be encouraged to finance this new asset class. Institutional capital will return to depressed real estate. Construction will absorb surplus manpower and create badly needed wage income. Cheap urban rents will bring India the full benefit of labor mobility, which isn't constrained by Chinese-style hukou, or city registration requirements. Yet the rapid urbanization that turned East Asia into an exporting powerhouse and created a foundation for mass consumption has eluded the country. Young men migrate to cities for economic reasons, and return to their villages in old age. Apart from cultural factors, availability and cost of housing is the main reason why women and children stay behind, making urbanization in India both slow and rather \"masculine,\" as economist Chinmay Tumbe, who has studied migration trends since the 1870s, has put it. While the gender ratio of large cities is no longer as skewed as it was in the early 20th century — 500 to 600 women for 1,000 men — it's still a lopsided 868 in Delhi. For Surat, a major diamond-cutting and textile center on India's western coast, the ratio is even more unbalanced at 756. Surat is still an exception in that it has a lot of manufacturing. A peculiar facet of rural-urban migration in India, according to Tumbe, is that most of the workers end up in service-industry jobs. Creaky infrastructure, infuriating red tape, occasionally overvalued currency and lack of meaningful free-trade arrangements have held back the share of manufacturing in the economy to 16% — a modest rise from 5% in 1901. Back then, British colonialists had kept India under-industrialized so they could sell their wares in a market that produced little of its own. Now, it's a small urban elite — whose own ancestors left villages a long time ago — that's keeping new migrants employed as chauffeurs, housemaids, condominium security and ATM guards. The economy is geared to satisfy the top 150 million earners, as Rathin Roy, until recently the director at the New Delhi-based National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, has argued. This depresses the wages that would be generated by becoming good at making what the next 300 million want. In the absence of broad-based income growth, consumers boosted spending by borrowing. When they eventually started to deleverage last year, India faced an acute demand funk, even for 7-cent munchies. Since then, Covid-19 hasn't been the only wake-up call. Rapidly deteriorating US-China relations portend sweeping changes in global supply chains, but even in its own neighborhood, India isn't competitive in manufacturing. A once-in-a-generation opportunity could slip out of its grasp. At a furniture store in Ho Chi Minh City some years ago, I saw colorful satin-upholstered sofas whose sides were drab black polyester. This, I was told, was because the sides would take dirt from motorbike tires and must be easy to clean: A Vietnamese family would park the two-wheeler, its most precious possession, next to the living-room furniture to keep it safe at night. Societies that value and make things that workers themselves use lift living standards and labor productivity. No wonder Vietnam, now a hub for Samsung Electronics Co, is winning investments from Inventec Corp, Apple Inc's main assembly partner for AirPods, as well as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, better known as Foxconn. India must also make more shoes, clothes and toys. To create a permanent urban workforce that will both produce and consume those wage goods, it should also build millions of new homes.

{"title": "Trump picks former Fed official Warsh to run US central bank", "body": "US President Donald Trump on Friday nominated former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to lead the US central bank when Jerome Powell's term as chair ends in May, setting the stage for a major shift in monetary policy at a time when Trump has repeatedly sought greater influence over the Fed. \"I have known Kevin for a long period of time and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,\" Trump said while announcing the nomination. \"He is central casting, and he will never let you down.\" Warsh, a frequent critic of the Fed, has advocated what he describes as a \"regime change\" in monetary policy. His appointment, subject to confirmation by the US Senate, comes amid heightened concerns over the central bank's independence from political pressure. The Federal Reserve has long been viewed as a stabilising force in global financial markets, largely because of its autonomy from the White House. However, Trump's repeated attacks on the Fed for resisting aggressive rate cuts have tested that independence. In January, Trump's Justice Department opened a criminal probe into Powell — a move Powell described as a pretext to pressure the Fed on policy decisions. The episode has complicated the political backdrop for confirming Powell's successor and raised speculation that Powell could remain on the Fed's board beyond his term as chair to help shield the institution from political interference. Warsh's nomination follows months of public speculation resembling an informal audition process. Several contenders, including White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street executive Rick Rieder, regularly appeared in the media to promote their economic views. Trump last August appointed White House adviser Stephen Miran to the Fed, where he has emerged as a vocal supporter of the deep interest rate cuts long demanded by the president. Trump has also attempted to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook — a case now before the US Supreme Court — which, if successful, would mark the first time a sitting Fed policymaker has been dismissed by a president. Although not formally part of the administration, Warsh has maintained close ties with Trump and has been a frequent guest at the president's Florida residence. Analysts expect him to advance many of Trump's priorities as a de facto \"shadow\" Fed chair until Powell's term ends in mid-May. A lawyer and visiting fellow in economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Warsh has argued that Trump is right to push for steep interest rate reductions. He has also criticised the Fed for underestimating productivity gains driven by artificial intelligence and has called for a broad overhaul of the institution, including shrinking its balance sheet and easing bank regulations. Warsh, 55, nearly secured the Fed chairmanship during Trump's first term but lost out to Powell. Since then, he has remained a prominent public voice, frequently criticising the Fed's handling of interest rates, bond purchases and balance sheet expansion. It remains unclear how his nomination will affect short-term interest rate policy. The Fed cut rates three times in 2025, bringing its benchmark rate to a 3.50%–3.75% range. In January, citing strong growth and a stabilising labour market, it paused further cuts. Markets currently do not expect another rate reduction until June, after a new chair takes office. With a background on Wall Street — including work managing assets for billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller — and family ties to major Trump supporter Ron Lauder, Warsh is expected to face close scrutiny over his independence. Warsh served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and was a key liaison to financial markets during the 2007–2009 global financial crisis under then-chair Ben Bernanke. While he did not oppose the Fed's large-scale bond purchases at the time, he later warned they could fuel inflation and resigned from the board. Although those inflation fears did not materialise, Warsh has continued to argue that the Fed's oversized balance sheet distorts markets. He now contends that reducing it would allow excess liquidity to flow into the real economy through lower policy rates.

{"title": "Quality gaps, weak logistics, poor certification holding back export diversification: Businesses", "body": "Bangladesh's export basket remains overwhelmingly dependent on garments, with business leaders saying years of discussion on diversification have yielded limited results. Weak quality control, outdated certification systems, poor logistics, high transport costs, capacity gaps in the SME sector and the absence of targeted international market strategies continue to stall progress, they told a roundtable in Dhaka today (10 December). Speakers at the event called for urgent policy reforms and structural upgrades to help Bangladesh expand beyond readymade garments. The roundtable, titled \"Export Diversification: Challenges and the Way Forward\", was organised by Pran-RFL Group and Prothom Alo, bringing together senior business leaders and government policymakers. Certification bottlenecks slowing exports At the programme, Rupali Chowdhury, managing director of Berger Paints Bangladesh, said Bangladesh must upgrade its quality control, testing and certification systems to global standards if it wants to enter new markets. \"We produce many items domestically, including food-grade cans, but we still have to send them to India or Singapore for certification,\" she said. \"Certification is weak across sectors – from agriculture to industrial products.\" She added that even large industries lack adequate laboratories. \"We do not have the necessary testing facilities, even for the pharmaceuticals sector, whereas India tests highly complex products used in human health.\" \"Building these facilities requires investment of several hundred crore dollars. BSTI must be upgraded to international standards and made category-specific,\" she said. Rupali also noted that weak compliance and long logistics delays are major barriers for exporters. Customs modernisation, automation and reducing processing times are essential, she said. \"Where China and Vietnam face market barriers, we could find opportunities.\" 'If Vietnam can export $300b, why can't we?' Pran-RFL Group Chairman Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, addressing the event, said Bangladesh has no alternative to expanding exports. \"If Vietnam can export $300 billion, why can't we?\" he asked. He said faster access to the US market requires introducing a direct Chattogram-New York shipping service. Criticising inefficiencies in port and customs operations, he said demurrage charges have risen even after foreign companies took over some port functions. \"Customs must be rationalised. Air freight costs are also hurting competitiveness. India can ship goods by air at lower costs, giving them an edge,\" he noted. Speaking at the event about the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry, Syed S Kaiser Kabir, managing director of Renata and vice-president of the Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, said treating entrepreneurs as \"criminals\" must stop. \"We supply medicines at the lowest prices in the world. Our net profit has fallen from 15% to 5%. Don't call us bloodsuckers – recognise us as entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"To earn dollars, we must also allow dollars to go out,\" he noted, stressing the need to simplify foreign investment rules. Highlighting the high value addition of the pharmaceutical sector, he said if Bangladeshi companies secure full regulatory approval in the US market, international confidence in local products would grow significantly. The industry, he added, should be prioritised in efforts to diversify the country's export basket. Speaking about Bangladesh dependence on garments, HSBC Bangladesh CEO Mahbub ur Rahman said that while exports rose from $9 billion two decades ago to nearly $50 billion today, Bangladesh has failed to scale up non-garment sectors. \"We must first identify which sectors outside garments have billion-dollar export potential,\" he said. SMEs also need tailored support as \"export processes are difficult for them\". He added that the Middle East and Asean markets offer major opportunities for expansion. Diplomatic commercial wings 'not effective' Export Promotion Bureau Vice-Chairman Mohammad Hasan Arif said commercial wings at Bangladesh missions abroad are not performing effectively. \"It takes officers four years to learn the job, and then they return home to other ministries. There is no environment for building any lasting institutional knowledge,\" he said. Arif proposed forming a specialised trade promotion agency similar to Japan's Jetro or South Korea's Kotra. Such a body would remain stationed abroad and work solely on trade and investment, coordinating between the EPB and commercial wings. He emphasised market research, participation in international fairs, entrepreneur delegations and product-specific market strategies. Highlighting the potential of plastic toys from the country, Bangladesh Plastic Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association President Shamim Ahmed said there is huge export potential for plastic toys and called for deemed export benefits for the sector. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association President Shahjahan Chowdhury said frozen food exports have declined over the past decade and require policy support. He said exports from the sector could reach $3 billion by 2030, up from the current $450 million. 'FTA not a magic wand' At the event, Commerce Adviser Sk Bashir Uddin said free trade agreements (FTAs) are widely misunderstood. \"Many believe FTAs are a magic wand. In reality, the issue is highly complex. Our trade with China is import-dependent; if we sign an FTA, we will lose,\" he said. He said Bangladesh already enjoys 99% duty-free access to China, but the trade imbalance makes an FTA risky. Speaking about non-performing loans, he said, \"Mismanagement has created Tk6.5 lakh crore in default loans, many war-torn countries do not have such figures.\" Responding to concerns over reserves, he said the interim government inherited net reserves equivalent to one month of imports. \"Now we have three to four months of cover.\" Adviser Bashir noted that Bangladesh must confront the root causes of inefficiency. \"Unless we acknowledge the wounds in our economy – ease of doing business and high operating costs – we cannot improve.\" At the programme, Rupali Chowdhury, managing director of Berger Paints Bangladesh, said Bangladesh must upgrade its quality control, testing and certification systems to global standards if it wants to enter new markets. \"We produce many items domestically, including food-grade cans, but we still have to send them to India or Singapore for certification,\" she said. \"Certification is weak across sectors – from agriculture to industrial products.\" She added that even large industries lack adequate laboratories. \"We do not have the necessary testing facilities, even for the pharmaceuticals sector, whereas India tests highly complex products used in human health.\" \"Building these facilities requires investment of several hundred crore dollars. BSTI must be upgraded to international standards and made category-specific,\" she said. Rupali also noted that weak compliance and long logistics delays are major barriers for exporters. Customs modernisation, automation and reducing processing times are essential, she said. \"Where China and Vietnam face market barriers, we could find opportunities.\" 'If Vietnam can export $300b, why can't we?' Pran-RFL Group Chairman Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, addressing the event, said Bangladesh has no alternative to expanding exports. \"If Vietnam can export $300 billion, why can't we?\" he asked. He said faster access to the US market requires introducing a direct Chattogram-New York shipping service. Criticising inefficiencies in port and customs operations, he said demurrage charges have risen even after foreign companies took over some port functions. \"Customs must be rationalised. Air freight costs are also hurting competitiveness. India can ship goods by air at lower costs, giving them an edge,\" he noted. Speaking at the event about the challenges facing the pharmaceutical industry, Syed S Kaiser Kabir, managing director of Renata and vice-president of the Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, said treating entrepreneurs as \"criminals\" must stop. \"We supply medicines at the lowest prices in the world. Our net profit has fallen from 15% to 5%. Don't call us bloodsuckers – recognise us as entrepreneurs,\" he said. \"To earn dollars, we must also allow dollars to go out,\" he noted, stressing the need to simplify foreign investment rules. Highlighting the high value addition of the pharmaceutical sector, he said if Bangladeshi companies secure full regulatory approval in the US market, international confidence in local products would grow significantly. The industry, he added, should be prioritised in efforts to diversify the country's export basket. Speaking about Bangladesh dependence on garments, HSBC Bangladesh CEO Mahbub ur Rahman said that while exports rose from $9 billion two decades ago to nearly $50 billion today, Bangladesh has failed to scale up non-garment sectors. \"We must first identify which sectors outside garments have billion-dollar export potential,\" he said. SMEs also need tailored support as \"export processes are difficult for them\". He added that the Middle East and Asean markets offer major opportunities for expansion. Diplomatic commercial wings 'not effective' Export Promotion Bureau Vice-Chairman Mohammad Hasan Arif said commercial wings at Bangladesh missions abroad are not performing effectively. \"It takes officers four years to learn the job, and then they return home to other ministries. There is no environment for building any lasting institutional knowledge,\" he said. Arif proposed forming a specialised trade promotion agency similar to Japan's Jetro or South Korea's Kotra. Such a body would remain stationed abroad and work solely on trade and investment, coordinating between the EPB and commercial wings. He emphasised market research, participation in international fairs, entrepreneur delegations and product-specific market strategies. Highlighting the potential of plastic toys from the country, Bangladesh Plastic Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association President Shamim Ahmed said there is huge export potential for plastic toys and called for deemed export benefits for the sector. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association President Shahjahan Chowdhury said frozen food exports have declined over the past decade and require policy support. He said exports from the sector could reach $3 billion by 2030, up from the current $450 million.

{"title": "Khaleda Zia: The life-long vigil for country and democracy", "body": "Much will be written in the days to come about her politics, her shortcomings, her convictions, and her contradictions. But today, as Bangladesh pauses, one truth stands clear: a life lived in defence of democratic choice, however turbulent and imperfect, has reached its final rest. Few leaders in South Asia have commanded such deep loyalty, provoked such polarised reactions, or remained so enduring a presence in national politics for more than four decades. Khaleda Zia was, in many ways, an unexpected figure in public life: a woman who entered politics reluctantly following the assassination of her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, only to become a dominant force in Bangladesh's political landscape. Khaleda Zia leaves behind a story inseparable from the story of Bangladesh itself — its ruptures and reconciliations, its hopes and heartbreaks, its battles against authoritarianism, and its unending fight to preserve the people's right to decide their own fate. More than a political leader, she was a figure woven into the very fabric of the country's democratic imagination. A woman who stood her ground when it was easier, safer, even wiser to step aside. A woman who, even when caged by power or cornered by circumstance, refused to bend. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel She lived, above all, by a simple moral principle: a person does what she must — in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles, dangers, and pressures. This, too, is the basis of all human morality. And it is in this unyielding sense of duty that her life must be read. From unprepared housewife to national leader Born on 15 August 1945 in Dinajpur, in what was then Bengal Presidency under British India, Khaleda Zia grew up far from the political centres of Dhaka. In 1960, she married Ziaur Rahman, unbeknownst to her, the man who would change the history of Bangladesh many times. For two decades, she remained a private figure — raising her two sons, accompanying her husband to state functions after he became president, and appearing only rarely in the public sphere. Everything changed on 30 May 1981, when President Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in Chattogram. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which he had founded, spiralled into disarray. Senior party leaders, sensing both crisis and opportunity, urged the bereaved young widow to take the helm. At first, she disagreed. Politics was not her chosen path. But history and circumstance pressed upon her. By 1983, she had become the party's vice-chairperson; by 1984, its chairperson. Her entry into politics coincided with one of Bangladesh's darkest periods: the military rule of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Khaleda Zia emerged quickly as one of the central figures in the anti-autocracy movement. Her rallies drew tens of thousands, her arrests — seven times between 1983 and 1990 — galvanised public support, and her increasingly forceful rhetoric helped shape the narrative of resistance. Khaleda Zia was the architect behind the formation of the seven-party alliance in 1983, created to bring an end to Ershad's autocratic rule. While the Awami League, under Sheikh Hasina's leadership, took part in the illegal election of 1986, Khaleda Zia continued the street movement. From then on, Khaleda Zia came to be known as the \"uncompromising leader\". Along with Sheikh Hasina, she became one of the two women who would dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades, but their partnership in the struggle would soon give way to bitter rivalry. The first female prime minister In 1991, following the fall of the Ershad regime and the restoration of parliamentary democracy, Bangladesh held its first truly competitive election in more than a decade. Unexpectedly, the BNP emerged victorious, mostly due to the personal image of Khaleda Zia, and she became the country's first female Prime Minister — and the second in the Muslim world. Her first term (1991–1996) remains widely regarded as her most substantive. She presided over the transition from a presidential to a parliamentary system, restored key democratic institutions, and initiated economic reforms aimed at liberalising markets and revitalising the private sector. Her government expanded rural electrification, promoted education — especially for girls — and fostered the country's nascent export-oriented garment industry, laying the foundation for what would later become the backbone of the economy. Internationally, she positioned Bangladesh as a responsible regional actor. Her administration navigated multiple crises, including natural disasters and political confrontations. Her refusal to accept the opposition's demands for a caretaker government eventually led to a nationwide agitation and the dissolution of Parliament in 1995. The February 1996 election — boycotted by all major opposition parties — was widely seen as farcical. However, once the Caretaker Government Bill was passed, she resigned peacefully. In a political environment often marked by zero-sum hostility, this is a legacy often overlooked but deeply significant. Return to office and years of turbulence Khaleda Zia returned to power in 2001 with a commanding majority, leading a four-party alliance that included Jamaat-e-Islami. Her second term unfolded in a deeply polarised political climate. The country confronted rising militancy, governance challenges, and spiralling confrontation between the major parties. Her government is credited with a number of major infrastructure and macroeconomic initiatives. Power generation increased, remittances surged, and Bangladesh secured record foreign exchange reserves. She lived, above all, by a simple moral principle: a person does what she must — in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles, dangers, and pressures. This, too, is the basis of all human morality. And it is in this unyielding sense of duty that her life must be read. Major projects — including roads, bridges, and telecommunications expansion — received momentum. Bangladesh received international praise for maintaining growth in the face of global recessionary winds, and Khaleda Zia's administration continued the expansion of primary education and rural services. Bangladesh was being dubbed as one of the emerging economic powers. The years of ordeal In 2007, during the military-backed caretaker government, Khaleda Zia and her political rival, Sheikh Hasina, were both arrested in a sweeping anti-corruption drive. What followed was a long cycle of legal battles, restrictions, and political marginalisation. Yet even then, her presence remained central to BNP's identity and the broader pro-democracy movement. She repeatedly refused to leave the country or agree to any backdoor deals with the shadow powers. The years after 2009 were perhaps the most challenging of her life. From 2009 to 2024, repeated attempts were made to humiliate Khaleda Zia at every step. Malicious rumours were spread about her. She was forcibly evicted from her home — one that held her husband's memories. She was subjected to solitary imprisonment between 2018 and 2020. Khaleda Zia was kept alone in a prison cell where the conditions were appalling. Her medical care remained shrouded in ambiguity and obstruction. During the Covid-19 pandemic, she was granted bail — largely to prevent her from dying in jail. In 2021, when she lay in the ICU and urgently needed treatment abroad, Sheikh Hasina dismissively remarked, \"I have allowed her to stay at home, I have allowed her treatment — what more does she want?\" She understood what fate awaited her. She accepted it. She lost one son; another was driven into exile abroad. Had she wished, she could have negotiated, sought personal guarantees, accepted safe passage, or left the country altogether. But she chose the harder path — because she believed her life belonged to Bangladesh. Yet even from her sickbed, she remained a symbol for tens of thousands who believed that Bangladesh's democratic future remained tied to her resilience. An indispensable figure Khaleda Zia's life cannot be understood without acknowledging the extraordinary struggle she had to endure for the country. During the harsh fascist rule, she was the steadfast guardian of national sovereignty, the moral counterweight to autocracy, and the final barrier against one-party rule. She shaped Bangladesh's democratic journey more than almost any other leader of her generation. Khaleda Zia's legacy is also deeply tied to the advancement of female education in Bangladesh. During her first term as Prime Minister in the 1990s, the government launched and expanded programmes that dramatically increased girls' enrolment in secondary schools, including the Female Secondary School Assistance Programme (FSSAP), stipends for rural girls, and tuition waivers for female students. These initiatives not only reduced dropout rates but also altered long-standing social attitudes, enabling girls from poor and marginalised families to continue their studies. By the end of her tenure, Bangladesh had achieved one of the most significant turnarounds in female secondary enrolment in the developing world — an achievement widely acknowledged by international agencies. She was the face of the anti-Ershad movement, the steward of the country's return to parliamentary democracy, and the architect of two democratic transfers of power. And even in her years of persecution under Sheikh Hasina, she came to embody the pro-democratic struggle. She truly earned her moniker — the uncompromising leader. Khaleda Zia leaves behind a complicated, contested, but profoundly influential legacy. She broke gender barriers long before they became talking points. She led her party for more than 40 years. She became the anchor of an opposition that, despite fragmentation and repression, survived largely because of her symbolic weight. Her passing leaves a void not only within her party but within the broader fabric of Bangladesh's political imagination. For millions, she represented resilience; for others, a reminder of the lost possibilities of democratic cooperation. Her journey will remain a central chapter in Bangladesh's modern history. She is survived by her son Tarique Rahman, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren. But beyond family, she leaves behind a political legacy that will continue to shape Bangladesh for years to come. And now, her work done, the battle fought, she has earned her eternal peace. May she rest in peace.

{"title": "WHO ‘concerned’ about pneumonia cases in Turkmenistan", "body": "The World Health Organization said Wednesday it was \"concerned\" about reports of pneumonia in Turkmenistan, a closed Central Asian country that has yet to declare any coronavirus cases. At a press conference after a delayed, 10-day mission in Turkmenistan, WHO's Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood recommended the government adopt measures including contact tracing \"as if COVID-19 were already circulating\". \"We are aware of and concerned of reports of acute respiratory disease or pneumonia,\" Smallwood said. She credited the government's \"recent activation of stronger measures\" as part of efforts to prevent the potential spread of the virus in the country. Smallwood added that authorities in the reclusive country of around six million people had conducted 60,000 coronavirus tests, citing official figures. \"The actions taken in Turkmenistan will have impact for the people in the country, but also throughout Central Asia, Europe and the world,\" Smallwood warned. State television on Wednesday evening showed strongman President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov wearing a mask for the first time as he was pictured fishing while on holiday. Berdymukhamedov then gave four large fish that he caught to a children's summer camp, where they were turned into fish soup, the report showed. Law enforcement on Monday began apprehending citizens for not wearing masks after the health ministry warned of \"high concentrations of dust\" and \"pathogens\" in the air. Police had previously been seen discouraging citizens from wearing masks and face coverings were absent at mass government events overseen by Berdymukhamedov in recent months — some of which attracted thousands of people. Speculation has been building that the authoritarian government in ex-Soviet Turkmenistan is preparing to acknowledge that the coronavirus has entered the country, even though health offices have not reported any infections. At a government press conference earlier on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Rashid Mederov appeared to suggest viruses could reach the country via dust storms. \"We do not exclude the influence of natural factors on the distribution of hazardous substances, including viruses. Especially dust and salt storms from the bottom of the Aral Sea,\" Meredov said, referring to a mostly dry inland lake in neighbouring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. That lake's devastation is the cause of regular ecological problems in the region. Turkmenistan ordered this week the suspension of passenger trains from Thursday. Meredov said Wednesday that buses between regions had been stopped and citizens from outside the capital would take university entrance exams remotely. Ashgabat's largest bazaar and a key supermarket chain were also shuttered earlier this week. The WHO had tried to visit the isolated, oil-rich country in the spring, but the mission was held up by travel logistics, the foreign ministry said. Last month the foreign ministry dismissed as \"fake news\" a US embassy health alert warning Americans over potential coronavirus cases in the country.

{"title": "Testing falls, so does detection", "body": "When the Covid-19 infection rate in the country is apparently on the rise, the scope of testing has decreased. During the 24 hours till 8 am on Friday, 14,650 samples were tested, which was the lowest number of single-day tests done in the last 12 days. At that time, 3,114 Covid-19 positive patients were identified, which is the lowest number of cases detected in a single day in the last 17 days. According to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), labs across the country tested more than 15,000 samples (15,965) for the first time on June 10. Since then, the number of tests has fluctuated between 15,000 and 18,000 per day. On June 26, the highest 18,498 samples were tested in a single day. However, the reported number of samples tested per day suddenly dropped below 15,000 on Friday. Dr Rizwanul Karim, joint secretary general of DGHS Covid-19 Control Room, told The Business Standard that the number of tests has reduced due to the imposition of testing fee at the government institutions and a change in the discharge criteria from the hospitals. At present, people who do not have any symptoms are not being tested. Dr Rizwanul said, \"According to the World Health Organisation's new discharge criteria, a patient can now be discharged from the hospital if he does not show any symptoms such as fever and cough for three consecutive days without taking any medication. A second test is not required for him, but he will stay at home in isolation for 14 days.\" \"Asymptomatic patients will be considered free of Covid-19 ten days after they test positive for the virus. There is no need for the second test. So, the number of tests has decreased,\" Dr Rizwanul Karim added. Death toll close to 2,000 Some 42 people have died from coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, Dr Nasima Sultana, additional director general of DGHS, said during a virtual briefing. The death toll now stands at 1,968 and the death rate at 1.26 percent. And the number of total infections stood at 156,391. \"Some 32 of the deceased patients were men and 10 were women. Of them, 18 were from Dhaka, 10 were from Chattogram, three each were from Rajshahi and Khulna, four were from Rangpur, three from Sylhet and one from Barishal,\" said Professor Dr Nasima Sultana. \"Some 31 patients died at different hospitals, and 11 died at their respective homes,\" Dr Nasima Sultana added.

{"title": "Implementing NEIR without reform will monopolise mobile market, hurt consumers: Traders", "body": "The country's mobile phone market will become monopolised if the National Equipment Identity Register (NEIR) system is implemented without reforms, mobile phone traders warned, saying the move would ultimately hurt ordinary consumers. The market will effectively fall under the control of a few companies, which will reduce competition and cause phone prices to rise abnormally, the traders said at a press conference held at the Bashundara City Shopping Complex Auditorium in Dhaka today (6 January). Speaking at the conference, Mobile Business Community Bangladesh Acting General Secretary Md Faisal Azad said, \"We are not opposing the NEIR system, rather we demand an effective and secure system in the interest of national security.\" He warned that it would be difficult for students and youth to buy quality smartphones if NEIR is implemented without reform, reducing access to digital services. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel \"Issues related to data security, market competition and consumer interests must be reformed before implementation,\" he added. Traders alleged that earlier assurances from authorities regarding NEIR have not been honoured. They said that according to the new system, more than two crore mobile phones, which came as gifts from overseas from expatriates to family members, will become unusable, since NEIR registration process is lengthy and complicated. It will also hurt the used mobile phone market as changing ownership of phones will become difficult, especially for low-income people and those from rural areas, curtailing the freedom of consumers, they added. They further alleged that communicating with Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) over the matter did not bring about any effective discussions. The traders warned that if competition decreases, the tendency for new phone models to enter the market will decline, and even if prices rise, there will be no effective mechanism to control them. At the same time, complexities may also arise in recovering lost or stolen phones, they said.

{"title": "Apple says Uighurs targeted in iPhone attack, disputes Google findings", "body": "Apple Inc on Friday confirmed that China's Uighurs, a mostly Muslim minority group considered a security threat by Beijing, had been the target of attacks due to iPhone security flaws, but disputed rival Alphabet Inc's description of the effort to track users of the smartphone in real-time. Google Project Zero researchers said last week that five security flaws led to a \"sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years.\" The researchers did not specify the communities, but CNN, TechCrunch and other news organizations reported that the attacks had been aimed at monitoring Uighurs. Reuters recently reported that China hacked Asian telecommunications companies to spy on Uighur travellers. Apple said on Friday the attack \"was narrowly focused\" and affected \"fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community\" rather than the \"en masse\" hack of iPhone users described by Google researchers. Apple also said it fixed the issue in February, within 10 days of being notified by Google. Apple said evidence suggested that the website attacks lasted only two months, rather than the two years that Google researchers had suggested. \"Google's post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of \"mass exploitation\" to \"monitor the private activities of entire populations in real-time,\" stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised,\" Apple said in a newsroom post. \"This was never the case.\" In a statement, Google said it stood by its findings and would continue to work with Apple and other companies to find and fix flaws. \"Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies,\" Google said in a statement. \"We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities.\" Google and Apple are rivals in the smartphone market, where their iOS and Android operating systems vie for users.

{"title": "India's Reliance seen emerging as bigger threat for US firms like Amazon, Walmart", "body": "A $20 billion fund raising spree may take India's Reliance closer to its dream of becoming a digital giant, further threatening the ambitious plans US companies like Amazon, Walmart and Zoom have for India. Stake sales in Reliance's digital unit Jio Platforms attracted not just private equity and sovereign wealth funds but also Google and Facebook, a strong endorsement for an enterprise that until a few years ago focussed largely on oil refining. Some industry watchers equate Reliance's digital plans - which extend from online shopping and cloud computing to telecom and digital payments - to China's Alibaba and Tencent, companies Reliance itself calls \"global peers\". Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses. With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in four years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India. On Wednesday, billionaire chairman Mukesh Ambani said Reliance will expand e-commerce platform JioMart - which connects small retailers with consumers - to offer not just groceries but also electronics and fashion goods. \"Jio Platforms not only has the backend infrastructure and development capabilities but also an ever expanding captive consumer base,\" said Mayank Vishnoi of Singapore-based financial advisory firm Resfeber International. \"The addition of new digital products targeting various sectors will pose threats to many large dominant players. Having strategic partners like Facebook and Google validates that Reliance gameplan is real.\" The recent stake sales gave Reliance a foreign partner for JioMart, which was launched this year. Facebook's WhatsApp, which counts India as its top market with 400 million plus users, will work closely in connecting small retailers to JioMart. \"We will cover many more cities, serve many more customers across India, and expand to many more categories,\" said Ambani. Asked about the potential impact on foreign businesses eyeing India, one local industry executive who advises US multinationals said: \"Amazon and Walmart should be scared.\" To be sure, Reliance will face stiff competition from Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart, as both companies have deep pockets and an already well-established warehousing and logistics supply chain in the country. JioMart currently delivers groceries in only 200 cities, while Amazon and Flipkart deliver a wide range of goods across the country. Walmart, Flipkart and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reliance also has a retail footprint of around 11,000 stores across 6,700 cities that offer a wide array of products. It has also partnered with over 45 top international brands including Tiffany & Co, Burberry and Jimmy Choo. Senior leadership at Flipkart has started keeping close tabs on Reliance, and there is a fear the Indian company will have an added advantage from the regulatory perspective, two sources close to the company told Reuters. The Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically. Amazon and Walmart have had regulatory troubles and face far tighter government oversight in India, where the prime minister has been promoting self reliance. On Wednesday, the company said it will develop education and healthcare solutions via its JioMeet video conferencing tool that saw 5 million users within days of its launch this month. JioMeet has a starkly similar design to its rival, US based Zoom Video Communications. Zoom said this month it had plans for a significant investment in India. Asked about Reliance, Zoom said it had experienced intense competition in the past but we \"know what it takes\" to become a platform of choice. \"This threat is real,\" one US tech executive in India said about Reliance. \"As of now, it's not changing the game, but that view can change in a year from now.\" Reliance JIO / Rising", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/tech/indias-reliance-seen-emerging-bigger-threat-us-firms-amazon-walmart-107089", "date": "2020-07-16T15:15:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 16 July, 2020, 03:15 pm Last modified: 16 July, 2020, 03:19 pm", "category": "tech", "language": "en", "token_count": 609, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:30:17.498394"}
{"title": "Going beyond growth: How Bangladesh can tackle poverty and inequality through job creation", "body": "I have always known Bangladesh as an example of resilience and poverty reduction. The country is globally recognised for its success in reducing poverty, backed by economic growth despite daunting challenges. In a recent visit to a village in Khulna in Bangladesh's coastal region, I met with a group of mothers who earn a living from planting and guarding saplings on the very polders that protect their communities from cyclones and tidal surges. I saw firsthand their hard work and determination to provide better education and opportunities for their children. This is but one example of the resilient and determined spirit that underpins Bangladesh's story of overcoming adversity. Between 2010 and 2022, 9 million people were lifted out of extreme poverty, and 25 million people from moderate poverty. Living standards improved, as did access to essential services like electricity, sanitation, and education. Rural areas have emerged as increasingly important drivers of this progress, benefiting from improved connectivity and increased agricultural employment. However, these achievements need unpacking and a deeper analysis as significant challenges loom large. The pace of poverty reduction has slowed since 2016, and economic growth has become less effective at reducing poverty, and income inequality has risen. Job creation stalled in the manufacturing sector, particularly affecting women and youth. Progress is being held back by infrastructure and service quality gaps. High enrolment hasn't translated into learning gains, and congestion is choking off agglomeration benefits. Accelerating poverty reduction will require ensuring economic growth benefits more people, notably women and youth, and improving the quality of jobs. The Bangladesh Poverty and Equity Assessment: Navigating the Road to Prosperity, launched last week, examines these patterns in detail. Bangladesh's progress is real—but it has been slowing and becoming less inclusive After 2016, the benefits of economic growth did not reach everyone equally. While overall spending in the country has gone up, most of the gains were enjoyed by richer households. Inequality in consumption remained stable nationally, but income inequality increased, rising from 51 to 54 Gini points. The poorest families have seen very little improvement in what they can afford. And since 2022, rising inflation and job losses have pushed vulnerable households into poverty and reduced real income for the poorest. Microsimulation-based estimates suggest that poverty increased from 18.7% in 2022 to 21.2% in 2025. Some 62 million Bangladeshis—roughly one third of the population—are vulnerable to falling back into poverty. Though social assistance programs more than doubled between 2016 and 2022, half of the poorest families did not receive any social assistance benefits, while 35% of the richest did in 2022. Social protection coverage in urban areas increased from 16 to 34.5% of households between 2010 and 2022, but leakage to better-off groups persisted. On top of this, electricity, fuel, and fertiliser subsidies favoured wealthier households. In 2022, these subsidies accounted for 22% of the poorest households' disposable income, yet the richest urban households alone captured nearly half of total electricity subsidy spending. Current growth trends may undermine future poverty gains Between 2010 and 2016, Bangladesh created about 1.1 million jobs annually, driven mainly by rapid industrial expansion. But, from 2016 to 2022, an agricultural resurgence accounted for nearly two-thirds of new employment – generating most of the 1.5 million new jobs created each year. This made rural areas—not cities—the engine of poverty reduction—a shift that reverses the typical development path where countries move away from agriculture. Youth unemployment also remained high, reaching 28% for tertiary-educated women and 25% for men. Women bore the heaviest burden. In urban areas, educated young women face unemployment rates of 18%. Female labour force participation in urban areas dropped 10 percentage points to 24% between 2010 and 2022, while in rural areas it increased by 15 percentage points to 51%. Climate risks compound these challenges. Even under optimistic scenarios, climate impacts could cut agricultural GDP by one-third and displace 13.3 million people by 2050. Toward a policy agenda for job creation The fastest path to reducing poverty and inequality is through job creation, particularly for youth, women, and vulnerable populations. A business-as-usual approach will not be enough. Comprehensive action across four interconnected priorities is needed: Together, these can restore the pro-poor growth that lifted millions from poverty—this time building the resilience needed to sustain it. A new chapter of shared prosperity Bangladesh has inspired through its success at reducing poverty at scale, although the pace slowed after 2016. Recent setbacks—rising poverty, deteriorating job quality, deepening vulnerability—underscore the urgency of a new approach. Bangladesh stands at a crossroads. Its decades-long development journey demonstrates what is possible, but inequalities will persist when economic growth does not translate into more and better-paying jobs for those who need them most. With strategic investments in infrastructure and human capital, paired with timely and ambitious reforms, Bangladesh can build a resilient economy where opportunity is widely shared. With that, I am confident that the mothers I met in the coastal region will see their own lives improve and their children grow up with equal opportunities for shared prosperity.

{"title": "Malaysia suspends access to Musk's Grok AI", "body": "Malaysia suspended access to Elon Musk's chatbot Grok over AI-generated pornographic content, the country's tech regulator said on Sunday. The decision follows global backlash after it emerged that Grok's image creation feature allowed users to sexualise pictures of women and children using simple text prompts. On Saturday Indonesia became the first country to deny all access to the tool, which has been restricted to paying subscribers elsewhere. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said in a statement it had \"directed a temporary restriction on access to the Grok artificial intelligence for users in Malaysia\" with immediate effect. When an AFP reporter in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur fed Grok prompts on Sunday, there was no response. \"This action follows repeated misuse of Grok to generate obscene, sexually explicit, indecent, grossly offensive and non-consensual manipulated images,\" the regulator said. The statement cited \"content involving women and minors, despite prior regulatory engagement and formal notices\" issued to Musk's X Corp. and xAI startup which developed Grok. The AI tool is integrated into social media platform X. The Malaysian regulator said it deemed the platform's safeguards inadequate, adding that access would resume only after the required changes are verified. X Corp. had \"failed to address the inherent risks posed by the design and operation of the AI tool\", relying \"primarily on user-initiated reporting mechanisms\", the regulator said. European officials and tech campaigners on Friday slammed Grok after its controversial image creation feature was restricted to paying subscribers, saying the change failed to address concerns about sexualised deepfakes. Grok had appeared to deflect the criticism with a new monetisation policy, posting on X on Thursday that image generation and editing were now \"limited to paying subscribers\", alongside a link to a premium subscription.

{"title": "KKR release Mustafizur as Shah Rukh Khan faces backlash from India's BJP, religious leaders", "body": "Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), co-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, have officially confirmed that Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman has been released from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL), scheduled to be held from March to May this year. KKR had secured Mustafizur's services for Rs9.20 crore after an intense bidding war with Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals at the players' mini-auction held last month. The franchise shared the update through a press statement today (3 January), stating that the decision was taken following instructions from the IPL governing body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). \"Kolkata Knight Riders confirms that BCCI/IPL, as the regulator of IPL, has instructed it to release Mustafizur Rahman from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season,\" the statement said. BCCI asks KKR to release Mustafizur Rahman from IPL 2026 squad \"The release has been carried out following due process and consultations, upon the instruction of the Board of Control of Cricket in India,\" it added. According to the statement, the BCCI will allow KKR to sign a replacement player for the 30-year-old left-arm pacer in line with IPL regulations, with further details to be communicated in due course. The issue had earlier triggered sharp reactions from Hindu religious leaders and politicians in India, many of whom targeted KKR owner Shah Rukh Khan after the franchise acquired Mustafizur amid tensions between India and Bangladesh. Yesterday, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and two Hindu spiritual leaders criticised Khan over KKR's decision to sign the Bangladeshi pacer. Today, BJP leader Sangeet Singh Som and other religious figures welcomed the BCCI's instruction to KKR to release Mustafizur from the squad. The developments come amid heightened tensions between India and Bangladesh following the fall of the Awami League government in 2024 and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's subsequent departure to India. Over the past few months, both countries have summoned each other's envoys over a range of contentious issues. Earlier today, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia told the media that the board asked KKR to release Mustafizur from the squad amid growing strain in bilateral ties between the two countries. Pressure had been mounting on the BCCI over Mustafizur's participation in the IPL, amid allegations of attacks on minorities in Bangladesh and India's expressed concern over the safety of minorities there. Last year, the cricket boards of India and Bangladesh postponed a white-ball bilateral series. On Friday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said the series will be played in Bangladesh in September this year, though there has been no commitment from the BCCI on the schedule yet. The Indian board remains non-committal and is unlikely to agree to the tour if the political situation does not improve. Mustafizur has featured in eight IPL editions since 2016, missing the tournament only in 2019 and 2020. He has previously played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. The upcoming edition was set to be his first season with three-time IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders.

Last month, Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma, founder of the Tipra Motha Party and royal scion of India's northeastern state of Tripura, also criticised the IPL and the BCCI over what he described as skewed recruitment priorities, referring to Mustafizur's acquisition. Debbarma argued that expensive foreign signings reduce opportunities for domestic cricketers. \"The release has been carried out following due process and consultations, upon the instruction of the Board of Control of Cricket in India,\" it added.

The hidden handle design, which functions through a key fob or mobile phone or by manually pressing it, has drawn scrutiny in both the United States and China over potential safety risks. Last year, the U.S. auto safety agency opened a defect probe into Tesla Model 3 sedan's emergency door release controls. Tesla, which did not comment on the investigation at the time, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday (3 February). China's industry ministry said on Monday that under its new safety technical requirements, every car door should be equipped with both exterior and interior handles. Mechanical release designs will be mandatory, with innovations such as electrical handles optional. China's new policy sets out rules for where handles must be located on the outside of a car and how they should function to ensure that they can be opened in the event of an accident. It also requires interior handles to be clearly visible. New vehicle models must align their door handle design with the new regulation from 1 January 2027 while approved models will come under the rules by 1 January 2029, the ministry said. Chinese state media reported in October that the driver of a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra sedan died in an accident after passers-by were unable to open the door to pull him out of the burning vehicle.

{"title": "Brad Pitt ponders retiring from acting", "body": "American actor Brad Pitt, who is looking forward to a life which is less focussed on acting, opened up about his film career and revealed that he is planning to make fewer movies. The actor, who rose to fame with the 1991 road movie Thelma and Louise, made an acclaimed return to the big screen with this year's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. His space drama Ad Astra is set to hit the theatres soon. But back-to-back major movies does not mean he's looking to work more at this stage in his career. It's actually the opposite for the star, reported People. \"It'll be fewer and farther in between for me, just because I have other things I want to do now,\" the 55-year-old actor said in a new interview with The New York Times. \"When you feel like you've finally got your arms around something, then it's time to go get your arms around something else,\" he added. Pitt previously spoke to People at the Los Angeles premiere of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, where he opened up about whether he had ever considered retiring, given director of the film Quentin Tarantino's vocal stance on it. Tarantino has often said he's retiring after 10 films, meaning he has one more left after Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. \"No, I don't know. I don't know. I enjoy doing other things,\" Pitt said of whether he has thought about retiring from acting. \"I think that one day I'll just wake up and organically it'll be done. Maybe I won't wake up and that's why it'll be done,\" he added at that time. Pitt also opened up to GQ Australia earlier this year about his interest in the movie industry as he gets older. \"I'm behind the camera on the producing side and I enjoy that a lot,\" he said about his recent projects with production company Plan B. \"But I keep doing less and less. I really believe that overall it's a younger man's game - not that there aren't substantial parts for older characters - I just feel, the game itself, it'll move on naturally. There will be a natural selection to it all,\" he added. He continued to the outlet, \"But I'm curious to see what the future of [film] is, what shape it takes. I really appreciate the streaming services because we're seeing more and more quality projects being made. We're seeing more writers and directors and actors getting a shot.

The unannounced arrival of a US government aircraft in the capital of Tierra del Fuego province fueled suspicions that President Javier Milei, a close ally of counterpart Donald Trump, is seeking to establish a joint naval base with the United States in the area. The US embassy in Buenos Aires confirmed the plane was carrying a bipartisan delegation from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce but did not name the members. According to local media, the Congress members traveled to the city in Patagonia region on a US Air Force Boeing C-40 Clipper. The embassy said they met with government officials and key stakeholders to discuss environmental degradation, permits for mine and waste management, the processing of critical minerals, public health and medical safety. Emiliano Fossatto, legal secretary of Tierra del Fuego province, which is governed by the left-wing opposition, told Radio 10 that the visit generated substantial \"uncertainty\" and that there had been no prior or subsequent communication with local authorities. \"The geolocation of the port of Ushuaia is significant; it's the gateway to Antarctica... a commercial and tourist waterway, so there may certainly be other motives\" behind the visit, Fossatto added. Senator Cristina Lopez, also an opponent of Milei, on X demanded explanations from the government over the delegation's arrival. \"Tierra del Fuego is not a foreign military base,\" she declared. Milei, in power since December 2023, has already received two heads of the US Southern Command in Ushuaia: Laura Richardson in 2024 and Alvin Holsey last year. Both visited the Integrated Naval Base project, which Argentina has been building since 2022. Milei's government has denied that Washington is involved in the conception of the base.

{"title": "World population in 2100 could be 2 billion below UN projections", "body": "Earth will be home to 8.8 billion souls in 2100, two billion fewer than current UN projections, according to a major study published Wednesday that foresees new global power alignments shaped by declining fertility rates and greying populations. By century's end, 183 of 195 countries — barring an influx of immigrants — will have fallen below the replacement threshold needed to maintain population levels, an international team of researchers reported in The Lancet. More than 20 countries — including Japan, Spain, Italy, Thailand, Portugal, South Korea and Poland — will see their numbers diminish by at least half. China's will fall nearly that much, from 1.4 billion people today to 730 million in 80 years. Sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, will triple in size to some three billion people, with Nigeria alone expanding to almost 800 million in 2100, second only to India's 1.1 billion. \"These forecasts suggest good news for the environment, with less stress on food production systems and lower carbon emissions, as well as significant economic opportunity for parts of sub-Saharan Africa,\" lead author Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, told AFP. \"However, most countries outside of Africa will see shrinking workforces and inverting population pyramids, which will have profound negative consequences for the economy.\" For high-income countries in this category, the best solutions for sustaining population levels and economic growth will be flexible immigration policies and social support for families who want children, the study concluded. \"However, in the face of declining population there is a very real danger that some countries might consider policies that restrict access to reproductive health services, with potentially devastating consequences,\" Murray cautioned. – 866 million people over 80 – \"It is imperative that women's freedom and rights are at the top of every government's development agenda.\" Social services and healthcare systems will need to be overhauled to accommodate much older populations. As fertility falls and life expectancy increases worldwide, the number of children under five is forecast to decline by more than 40 percent, from 681 million in 2017 to 401 million in 2100, the study found. At the other end of the spectrum, 2.37 billion people — more than a quarter of the global population — will be over 65 years old by then. Those over 80 will balloon from about 140 million today to 866 million. Sharp declines in the number and proportion of the working-age population will also pose huge challenges in many countries. \"Societies will struggle to grow with fewer workers and taxpayers,\" noted Stein Emil Vollset, a professor at the IHME. The number of people of working age in China, for example, will plummet from about 950 million today to just over 350 million by the end of the century — a 62 percent drop. The decline in India is projected to be less steep, from 762 to 578 million. In Nigeria, by contrast, the active labour force will expand from 86 million today to more than 450 million in 2100. These tectonic shifts will also reshuffle the pecking order in terms of economic clout, the researchers forecast. – A new multipolar world – By 2050, China's gross domestic product will overtake that of the United States, but fall back into second place by 2100, they predict. India's GDP will rise to take the number three spot, while Japan, Germany, France and the UK will stay among the world's 10 largest economies. Brazil is projected to fall in ranking from eighth today to 13th, and Russia from the number 10 spot to 14th. Historical powers Italy and Spain, meanwhile, decline from the top 15 to 25th and 28th, respectively. Indonesia could become the 12th largest economy globally, while Nigeria — currently 28th — is projected to crack the top 10. \"By the end of the century, the world will be multipolar, with India, Nigeria, China and the United States the dominant powers,\" said Richard Horton, describing the study as outlining \"radical shifts in geopolitical power.\" Until now, the United Nations — which forecasts 8.5, 9.7 and 10.9 billion people in 2030, 2050 and 2100, respectively — has virtually had a monopoly in projecting global population. The difference between the UN and IHME figures hinges crucially on fertility rates. The so-called \"replacement rate\" for a stable population is 2.1 births per woman. UN calculations assume that countries with low fertility today will see those rates increase, on average, to about 1.8 children per woman over time, said Murray. \"Our analysis suggests that as women become more educated and have access to reproductive health services, they choose to have less than 1.5 children on average,\" he explained by email. \"Continued global population growth through the century is no longer the most likely trajectory for the world's population.\" Founded in 2007 and supported by the Bill and & Melinda Gates Foundation, the IHME had become a global reference for health statistics, especially its annual Global Burden of Disease reports.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/world-population-2100-could-be-2-billion-below-un-projections-106384", "date": "2020-07-15T10:50:00+06:00", "author": "BSS/AFP 15 July, 2020, 10:50 am Last modified: 15 July, 2020, 10:56 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 830, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:30:41.654237"}

The win brought to a close a year in which the 24-year-old had to bounce back from a three-month ban, which chopped out a large chunk of his season despite the World Anti-Doping Agency accepting that the Italian was accidentally contaminated with banned substance clostebol in March 2024. \"I was thinking about a lot and at the same time not a lot. There was a lot of tension because if I lost that point we go into a tie-break and then it becomes a different match,\" added Sinner. \"But in that moment I was probably more relieved about the end of the season. I had a similar feeling last year but it was different. \"This year it was a more powerful feeling for a variety of reasons. It was a really emotional moment.\" Sinner's win was his second over Alcaraz this year and a big moment after he lost the year-end world number one spot to the Spaniard, who won eight tournaments this year and took his Grand Slam tally to six. Alcaraz was left to rue missed opportunities at key moments of a typically tight match between the two best players in the world, with his backhand failing him when he had chances to strike. \"Right now I have some points and some shots on my mind. For example, the backhand volley that I missed. I missed a few of the backhand volleys... which I'm really disappointed in,\" said Alcaraz. \"I would say that was the key because it was a really important moment that I didn't finish the point with the backhand volley... I think that was a really important shot that I didn't do well today.\" Jannik Sinner / Carlos Alcaraz / ATP Finals", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/sinner-wins-alcaraz-battle-retain-atp-finals-title-1287881", "date": "2025-11-17T13:55:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 17 November, 2025, 01:55 pm Last modified: 17 November, 2025, 04:40 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 473, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:30:48.451050"}

{"title": "City deserve an apology says defiant Guardiola", "body": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his team deserved an apology, after their two year UEFA ban from European football was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) — a verdict he called a \"good day for football\". Guardiola said the club's reputation had been damaged by the furore around allegations that they broke Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules and fired back at comments from managers Jose Mourinho and Juergen Klopp. \"Jose and all the managers should know that we were damaged. We should be apologised (to). Because, like I said many times, if we did something wrong, we will accept absolutely the decisions by UEFA and CAS because we did something wrong,\" he said in a news conference on Tuesday. \"We have the right to defend ourselves when we believe what we have done is correct, is right. Three independent judges said this,\" he added. Liverpool manager Klopp had described the CAS verdict on Monday as \"not a good day for football\" but Guardiola disagreed. \"Yesterday was a good day for football because we play with the same rules of FFP as all the clubs in Europe. All of them. (If) we break this FFP, we will be banned,\" he said. \"We were damaged. The people say that we cheated and lying many, many times. The presumption of innocence was not there and after, when it happened and it was right, of course we are incredibly happy because we can defend what we have done on the pitch.\" Guardiola also took aim at Spanish league president Javier Tebas, a long standing critic of City, who had questioned whether CAS was the right court for deciding such matters. \"He is another one, this guy Senor Tebas must be so jealous for the Premier League, the English football,\" he said. \"He is incredible legal expert from what I see, so next time we will ask in which court, which judges we have to go. He has to be a little bit worried or concerned about La Liga, (he should) focus on there. \"Normally these kind of people, when the sentence is good for him its perfect, like happened many times in Spain right now, but when the sentence is against, the problem is for the other ones,\" added Guardiola. \"We will be in the Champions League next season, Senor Tebas, because what we did, we did it properly.\" Pep Guardiola / manchester city / uefa", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/city-deserve-apology-says-defiant-guardiola-106240", "date": "2020-07-14T20:40:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 14 July, 2020, 08:40 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 08:47 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 406, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:30:54.906038"}

{"title": "China’s new XR chip aims to outpace Apple in the race for spatial computing", "body": "GravityXR's unveiling of a next generation mixed reality chip has stirred fresh excitement in China's fast growing spatial computing sector. The young company, founded by former Apple engineer and Stanford graduate Wang Chaohao, introduced the Jizhi G-X100 last week. According to the South China Morning Post, it is the country's first all in one mixed reality chip built on an advanced 5 nanometre process. Wang demonstrated the chip at GravityXR's lab in Ningbo. The G-X100 can deliver photon to photon latency of just 9 milliseconds. Apple's Vision Pro sits at 12 milliseconds. The difference may seem small, but in extended reality, such margins often decide whether a headset feels natural or causes strain. Yongjiang Lab, the provincial government backed incubator that supported GravityXR early on, called the chip a major breakthrough. Its researchers noted that the G-X100 addresses a core problem in spatial computing. The chip is fast and energy efficient. It can also help cut the weight of AI glasses to below 100 grams, a key step toward making them practical for everyday use. Industry forecasts show a market ready for change. Counterpoint Research expects global XR display shipments to rise 6% this year, while AR glasses could see 42% growth. GravityXR also revealed two supporting chips. One is tailored for high definition video capture in lightweight wearables. The other focuses on low power spatial and three dimensional rendering. The start-up has already secured backing from major investors and counts Meta Platforms, Goertek and robotics firm Agibot among its clients.

{"title": "US pandemic aid saved 51m jobs, but wealthy also benefited", "body": "A high-profile pandemic aid program protected about 51.1 million US jobs, the Trump administration said on Monday. The administration revealed how $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash was injected into small businesses as well as into the pockets of the rich and famous. The job retention data comes amid positive reports that the US services sector rebounded in June to nearly pre-crisis levels, but is tainted by concerns about whether the employment scheme truly benefited the most needy. The data on the small business Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has been released after initial resistance and seems to confirm worries among Democrats and watchdog groups that in addition to mom-and-pop shops, the funds went to well-heeled and politically-connected companies – some of which were approved for between $5 million and $10 million. Those include several firms that lobby on public policy, such as Wiley Rein LLP and APCO Worldwide, as well as prominent law firms like Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, which has represented President Donald Trump, and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, reports Reuters. Kasowitz Benson Torres said the funding helped the law firm preserve hundreds of jobs at full salary at a time when federal courts and its offices were shut down. The gallery of well-connected names extended deeply into the world of America's privileged and super famous. Sidwell Friends School, an exclusive private school which educated former President Barack Obama's daughters, was approved for between $5 million and $10 million, as was Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, which – with tuition exceeding $50,000 per year – is attended by the children of hedge fund managers and celebrities. Newsmax Media Inc, the media company run by Trump donor Christopher Ruddy, got the nod for between $2 million and $5 million. So did billionaire rapper Kanye West's Yeezy LLC clothing company. Newsmax said in a statement it was eligible for the program and did receive a loan, but declined to elaborate. Aside from Kasowitz Benson Torres and Newsmax, the other companies and schools did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, whose stated mission is to curb government spending, was also approved for a loan of between $150,000 and $350,000. \"The initial data is revealing many recipients that are appropriately raising eyebrows, which was one of the many reasons we wanted it public,\" said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight. Launched in April, the unprecedented program - which has been extended until August 8 - allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply for a forgivable government-backed loan from a lender. The data shows loans that have been approved, but it does not say how much was disbursed, nor which loans have been forgiven so far. The loans were largely dished out on a good-faith basis, with borrowers certifying their eligibility and the accuracy of the data they provided, meaning the figures on how many jobs were retained has not been thoroughly vetted. While the data does not say exactly how much money each borrower received, they are placed in one of five bands: $150,000-350,000; $350,000-1 million; $1-2 million; $2-5 million; and $5-10 million. More than 4,800 loans were issued in the top band, while the overall average loan size was $107,000, the data shows. Loans that appear to breach the letter or spirit of the rules may not be forgiven, and the Treasury plans to conduct a full review of loans of more than $2 million. The Department of Justice has already brought charges against several PPP borrowers for fraudulently seeking loans, while several federal and state regulators are also probing misuse of the funds. Despite some eyebrow-raising recipients, the funds reached a wide swathe of businesses: more than $67 billion for the healthcare and social assistance sector, $64 billion-plus for construction businesses, $54 billion for manufacturing and, at the smaller end, more than $7 billion for religious organizations, the data showed. Senior administration officials hailed the program as a \"wild success,\" with the data showing it supported about 84 percent of all small business employees. US service sector rebounds US services industry activity rebounded sharply in June, but a resurgence in novel coronavirus cases that has forced some restaurants and bars to close again threatens the emerging recovery. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its non-manufacturing activity index jumped to a reading of 57.1 last month, the highest since February, from 45.4 in May. It has bounced back from a reading of 41.8 in April, which was the lowest since March 2009. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index increasing to a reading of 48.9 in June. The report followed the ISM's manufacturing survey last week showing factory activity rebounding to a 14-month high in June. The upbeat surveys, however, have been overshadowed by raging Covid-19 cases in large parts of the country, including the densely populated California, Florida and Texas. The flare-up in cases that started in late June has prompted several states to scale back or pause reopenings, hitting restaurants and bars hard. The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry increased to a reading of 61.6 in June from 41.9 in the prior month. There was an increase in export orders, and order backlogs swelled. The survey's index of services industry employment rose to a reading of 43.1 last month from 31.8 in May. Though this measure has pulled off 30.0 in April, a level last seen in 1997, it was at odds with a report last Friday showing nonfarm payrolls surging by a record 4.8 million jobs in June. The services sector accounted for 4.263 million of the jobs.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/global-economy/us-pandemic-aid-saved-51m-jobs-wealthy-also-benefited-103165", "date": "2020-07-07T21:45:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 07 July, 2020, 09:45 pm Last modified: 07 July, 2020, 09:54 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 961, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:31:01.384863"}

{"title": "American Airlines sending 25,000 furlough notices as US demand sags", "body": "American Airlines (AAL.O) said on Wednesday it is sending 25,000 notices of potential furloughs to frontline workers and warned that demand for air travel is slowing again as COVID-19 cases increase and states re-establish quarantine restrictions. The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act requires companies to provide 60 days' notice of potential layoffs or furloughs. In a memo to employees released on Wednesday, American said the notices are tied to the overstaffing it expects in October when US government payroll assistance expires. American, with more than 130,000 employees in 2019, had already warned that furloughs would be hard to avoid as pandemic-hit revenue remains more sluggish than the airline had hoped. Among different work groups, warnings are being sent to 2,500 pilots or about 18% of the total, nearly 10,000 flight attendants or 37% of the total, and 3,200 mechanics or 22% of the total. Overall, American expects to be overstaffed by about 20,000 in the fall, but hopes to reduce the actual number of furloughs through enhanced leave and early-departure programs it has rolled out alongside unions, Chief Executive Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said in the memo. They noted, however, that if Congress passes another round of payroll support through March 31, the need for involuntary furloughs at that time would be \"much less throughout the industry\" because \"there would most certainly be more demand for air travel.\" Unions representing aviation workers have asked lawmakers for another $32 billion in payroll aid to keep hundreds of thousands of workers employed for another six months past October. Airlines are not opposed to the idea but so far have not actively lobbied for it. Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said this week it believed it could avoid furloughs after about 17,000 employees signed up for early-departure deals. By encouraging more senior workers to leave, US airlines could trim their labor costs - their main expense - during the recovery, giving them more pricing power. Airline union contracts require airlines to furlough junior workers first. United Airlines (UAL.O) has sent 36,000 furlough notices, representing about 45% of workers, and Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) has also warned that job losses will be hard to avoid. After boosting summer flying following some signs of pent-up leisure demand in May and June, some airlines are now scaling back their schedules due to a surge in COVID-19 cases across the country. The US outbreak has prompted several countries to impose travel restrictions on Americans. The European Union excluded the United States from its \"safe\" travel list. Both Canada and Mexico want to extend the ban on non-essential travel at US borders. Even within the United States, Americans from 22 states are required to self-quarantine for 14 days if they enter New York or New Jersey, two states that have managed to curb infections.

{"title": "Imran Khan to join Xi Jinping to shore up Nepal’s PM Oli against India", "body": "Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has decided to extend his support to Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli who is finding himself increasingly isolated within the ruling Nepal Communist Party after blaming India for a rebellion in his party, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. PM Oli had on Sunday accused his detractors of trying to push him out of power, accusing India and politicians in Nepal of being involved in a conspiracy to topple him for publishing the country's new map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory. This accusation, however, appeared on Tuesday to have backfired on PM Oli after rival leaders such as Pushpa Kamal Dahal \"Prachanda\" demanded that he quit his leadership role in the party and government. They had earlier given him an option to retain one of the two posts. Imran Khan's outreach to PM Oli comes at a time when he is struggling to stay in power. Officials told HT that Islamabad had sent a formal communication to the Nepalese foreign ministry to fix a time for Imran Khan's phone call to PM Oli. Imran Khan has proposed a 12 noon phone call on Thursday (12.45 pm Nepal Time, 12.30 pm IST). Diplomatic sources said it is obvious that the flavour of the conversation is going to be India. Imran Khan's Pakistan has accused India of engineering the terrorist attack at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi while PM Oli has been accusing India of destablising his government. The phone call comes at a time Xi Jinping's China is engaged in a standoff with India over Ladakh. The two prime ministers also owe a huge debt to China for projects that critics say, largely serve Beijing's interests. \"China is their common link,\" a Kathmandu watcher said. On the domestic front, PM Oli's move to come out with a redraw his country's political map and whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments was an attempt to consolidate his support within the party. PM Oli tried to use it to the hilt this weekend, imputing motives to his rivals who want to see his back. Prachanda and Oli are co-chairs of Nepal's communist party. Oli is, however, seen to lean a little too heavily towards China and has managed to hold on to the PM's post due to Beijing's intervention in the past. PM Oli's hard push to redraw the Himalayan nation's political map to create a dispute with New Delhi was also timed to serve China's interests.

{"title": "2013 Shapla Chattar killings: ICT sets 5 April for probe report against Hasina, 24 others", "body": "The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has directed its investigation agency and prosecution to complete their probe and submit a report within two months against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 24 others in a case involving crimes against humanity and mass killings during a Hefazat-e-Islam rally at Shapla Chattar in 2013. A two-member bench of International Crimes Tribunal-1, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, issued the order today (5 February), setting 5 April as the deadline for submitting the investigation report. Earlier, 5 February had been fixed for the submission of the report. However, Prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim sought an additional two months to complete the investigation. Following political changes in the country on 5 August 2024 and the subsequent reconstitution of the tribunal, Hefazat-e-Islam leader Azizul Haque filed a complaint with the chief prosecutor over the 5 May 2013 incident. He lodged the complaint on behalf of Hefazat leaders Junaid Al Habib and Maulana Mamunul Haque. Earlier in the day, 5 arrested accused were produced before the tribunal. They are former state minister for home affairs Shamsul Haque Tuku, former army officer Major General Ziaul Ahsan, former former inspector general of police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Haque, former deputy inspector general (DIG) Molla Nazrul Islam, and Shahriar Kabir, president of the advisory council of the Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee.

{"title": "Mexico to kick off 2026 World Cup against South Africa, US get dream draw", "body": "The 2026 World Cup will kick off on 11 June with joint-hosts Mexico playing South Africa at the Azteca Stadium - iconic venue of the 1970 and 1986 finals - followed by South Korea against a playoff winner after the complex draw was made on Friday. Mexico's co-hosts the United States and Canada will join the biggest-ever World Cup party the following day. The US, courtesy of their top seeding, got a dream draw and will play Paraguay, Australia and a playoff winner. Canada, also a top seed despite a world ranking of 27th, have it tougher against a playoff winner - possibly Italy - Switzerland and Qatar. The draw for the expanded 48-team tournament, with six berths still to be filled via a series of playoffs, was hugely complicated due to various geographical sub-clauses. Former England defender and MC Rio Ferdinand routinely returned balls to the metaphorical pot after \"computer said no\". Defending champions Argentina were grouped with Algeria, Austria and debutants Jordan, while five-times winners Brazil will play Morocco - semi-finalists in 2022 - Haiti and Scotland. The Scots are appearing in the finals for the first time since 1998, when they lost to Brazil in the opening game, while Haiti's only previous appearance came in 1974. France's first game will be versus Senegal in a repeat of one of the biggest tournament upsets, when the Africans stunned the then-holders in their first game of the 2002 tournament. Norway and one of the playoff winners complete their group. England will start against Croatia, who beat them in the 2018 semi-finals, and also face Panama, who they thrashed 6-1 in the group stage in the same tournament, and Ghana. Debutants Curacao, with a population of 150,000 making them by far the smallest country ever to reach the finals, face Germany, Ecuador and the Ivory Coast. World number-one-ranked Spain have a dream draw alongside first-timers Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay. The Netherlands are with Japan, Tunisia and a playoff winner, Belgium have Egypt, Iran and New Zealand, while Portugal face debutants Uzbekistan, Colombia and a playoff winner. The teams outside the hosts' groups will have to wait until Saturday to find out the venues and kickoff times for their games after FIFA attempts to optimise them relating to the various worldwide TV markets. A newly introduced seeding system ensured that the current top four in the world - Spain, Argentina, France and England - cannot meet until the semi-final stage if they win their groups, but that has not ruled out a host of potential blockbuster clashes along the way. France could face tough route to final France, runners-up in 2022, might like the look of their group but, if results go to form, once they reach the last 16 they can expect a potential run of Germany, the Netherlands and Spain to reach the final. England's pathway to the showpiece match has a very Latin - and difficult - look with Mexico, Brazil, who they have never beaten at the World Cup, and Argentina in the way of a first final appearance since their sole triumph in 1966. Mexico have a favourable group but will be looking beyond that in the hope of at least matching their performance as hosts in 1986 when they reached the quarter-finals. Since then they suffered a remarkable seven consecutive last-16 exits and then failed to get out of their group in 2022. \"There are no small opponents. We must not get complacent, we have to work hard,\" said Mexico coach Javier Aguirre. \"We'll be repeating our opening match from 15 years ago and we'll have to be ready.\" The US have a winnable group and their Argentine coach Mauricio Pochettino sounded upbeat. \"We need to be strong in our belief, keep improving, thinking big of course and to go and to win the World Cup,\" he said. \"But before that we need to play and be motivated with these guys that are going to be really tough.\" Remarkably, despite playing each other 106 times, Brazil and Argentina have met in the World Cup knockout stage only once, when the Argentines won 1-0 in the 1990 Round of 16, but they could be on course for a seismic semi-final showdown next year.

{"title": "Global population likely to reach 8.5 billion in 2030: UN", "body": "The United Nations on World Population Day on Saturday showed in its world population trend that the number of global population stands at about 7.7 billion. \"It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world population to grow to 1 billion but in just another 200 years or so, the global population grew sevenfold,\" the UN data shows. According to the global population trend by the UN, in 2011, the global population reached 7 billion mark, and today it stands at about 7.7 billion. The global population is expected to grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 10.9 billion in 2100, the UN predicts. This dramatic growth has been driven largely by increasing numbers of people surviving to reproductive age, and has been accompanied by major changes in fertility rates, increasing urbanization and accelerating migration. These trends will have far-reaching implications for generations to come. The recent past has seen enormous changes in fertility rates and life expectancy. According to the Global Population Trend by the UN, in the early 1970s, women had on average 4.5 children each; by 2015, total fertility for the world had fallen to below 2.5 children per woman. Meanwhile, average global life spans have risen, from 64.6 years in the early 1990s to 72.6 years in 2019. In addition, the world is seeing high levels of urbanization and accelerating migration. The year 2007 was the first year in which more people lived in urban areas than in rural areas, and by 2050 about 66 percent of the world population will be living in cities. Megatrends & far-reaching implications They affect economic development, employment, income distribution, poverty and social protections. They also affect efforts to ensure universal access to health care, education, housing, sanitation, water, food and energy.

{"title": "The globalisation of the war on Asian scam networks", "body": "A trial got underway in Seoul last week for 46 South Koreans, mostly men in their 20s, accused of participating in online scam operations in Cambodia. Since mid-October, South Korea has repatriated 107 nationals from Cambodia, where officials estimate upwards of 1,000 of its citizens are working either \"voluntarily or involuntarily\" in scam compounds. The repatriation effort follows public outrage over the death of a South Korean college student who was reportedly lured to Cambodia and forced to work in a scam centre. The 22-year-old man's body was discovered with injuries consistent with torture, suggesting that he may have been beaten to death. An autopsy revealed he \"died as a result of severe torture, with multiple bruises and injuries across his body,\" according to a Cambodian court statement. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said, \"The government's greatest responsibility is to safeguard the lives and safety of our people. \"We must protect the victims and swiftly repatriate those involved in these incidents back to Korea.\" South Korea recently joined the US, UK and Singapore in imposing sanctions on Cambodia's Prince Holding Group, a multinational network whose founder is accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia — charges the company has rejected. \"What we have seen recently is that, like South Korea, there has been a push towards following the money and putting sanctions and freezing people's money,\" said Brian Hanley, Asia-Pacific director for the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA), a global non-profit fighting online fraud. \"And we think this has started to make a dent.\" Billions lost to Southeast Asia scam networks Southeast Asia has become a major hub for digital scam operations. The United Nations estimated in 2023 that over 200,000 people have been trafficked into countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia under the guise of lucrative job offers. There, they work in massive scam centres that are part of a multibillion-dollar cyber fraud industry that runs online scamming schemes. These large scam operations are concentrated in remote conflict zones of Southeast Asia, particularly along Thailand's borders with Cambodia and Myanmar. Recent clashes between Thai and Cambodian forces have included strikes on suspected scam compounds in Cambodia. In Myanmar, such centres have proliferated and are reportedly financing both sides of the country's ongoing civil war. Scam centre workers are typically citizens of Asian countries who are often victims of human trafficking. The scams primarily target people in Western, English-speaking nations. \"We're talking about human trafficking and slavery, so obviously this is a major human rights issue,\" said Hanley. \"But it is also a national security issue, not just for the region but for the whole world.\" In its State of the Scams 2025 report, GASA estimates that $442 billion (€375.4 billion) has been lost to scams worldwide in the 12 months ending October 2025. That figure could be higher, as many people do not report their losses to online scams. GASA also found that 57% of adults worldwide have had a scam experience in the last 12 months. Examples of scams include online shopping, investment and romance scams, which fraudsters refer to as \"pig butchering,\" a term referring to \"fattening\" victims by gaining their trust, often through fictitious romantic relationships. Once trust is established, scammers convince victims to transfer funds into fake cryptocurrency investment platforms, which are then laundered through accounts across Asia, making recovery extremely difficult. Why the US is a top target for scammer networks The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimates that the scam industry in Southeast Asia defrauds Americans of $9 billion to $10 billion (€7.7 billion to €8.5 billion) per year. The GASA report says that $64.8 billion was stolen from Americans in the year ending in October 2025, with each victim losing an average of $1,087. It added that the average American now encounters a scam attempt every single day. In response to rising instances of cyber fraud, US authorities established the Scam Center Strike Force in November. It is an interagency task force focused on investigating, dismantling, and prosecuting scam centres and those who finance them. \"My office will not stand by as these Chinese organised crime enterprises empty out the bank accounts of hardworking Americans,\" said US Attorney Jeanine Pirro when launching the task force. The US partnered with the UK in 2025 to sanction individuals and entities that operate illegal scam centres across Southeast Asia. Australia and Singapore also made strides in enacting legislation to protect their citizens from scams and also cooperate with the US on law enforcement operations and sanctions. For Jacob Sims, a visiting fellow at the Asia Center at Harvard University who has been tracking transnational crime in Cambodia and greater Southeast Asia, the issue of scams has gained significant political traction in the US over the past year. \"A year ago today in [Washington, DC], there was one sanction,\" said Sims. \"And today, a large number of the prominent names and entities have been sanctioned, and there are a dozen bills in Congress.\" However, these actions have also been hampered by cuts to USAID programs in Southeast Asia that monitored human trafficking along the Thai-Myanmar border and in Cambodia, which were eradicated under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). \"The response thus far, as much momentum as there clearly is, does not yet constitute a truly strategic response and is not yet commensurate to the threat or sufficient to meaningfully disrupt it,\" said Sims. The role of China in scam centres Many of the massive scam centres across Southeast Asia are said to be run by Chinese criminal networks. China has taken steps to shut down scam centres in Cambodia and Myanmar — but only those targeting Chinese people. A report submitted to the US Congress in July found few links between these criminal networks and the Chinese government or members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but stated that the actions of these organisations often further fuel these regional conflicts through corruption and crime. Even with the recent announcements of sanctions and criminal investigations, countries like South Korea and even the US appear reluctant to criticise the governments of China or Cambodia and instead target the criminals and their networks directly. According to Sims, as long as Phnom Penh performs just enough cooperation to preserve the illusion that it remains strategically \"in play,\" Western capitals have proven reliably willing to tolerate industrial-scale scams targeting their own citizens. \"Many governments hesitate to confront Cambodia directly because they still view it as a pivotal chess piece in a China-versus-the-West geopolitical game,\" he said.

{"title": "How to set your travel budget", "body": "Are you a frequent traveller? If you spot a great travel deal or receive an alert from the various travel portals you are listed on, do you tend to opt for it immediately? Are you able to travel without worrying about money? Here's how you can make your plans guilt-free: Start With Major Transportation Cost Start your research to get an estimate for what the travel will cost. If you're going from one continent to the other, look at the airfares. If you're going for a shorter distance, it's worth looking at train or bus fares. Check various travel aggregators and put alerts for drop-in airfares at least 90 days before an international trip. Budget For Other Transportation You are likely to need transportation once you arrive at your destination. Public transportation is a great option in most cases because it's inexpensive and it gives you a more local perspective. Also, factor in taxis if you think you might need one from the airport or within the city. Do you have more than one city on your itinerary? Bus, train and boat prices are typically easy to find online. Check The Rate Of Your Accommodation Decide what type of accommodation you prefer – hotels, hostels, guest houses or apartment rentals. Make sure you read the reviews and check out the prices in the area where you plan to stay. Be sure to multiply by the number of nights you will be there. Decide How Much You Will Spend On Food If you're travelling to Western Europe, Australia or New Zealand, the United States or Canada, eating out will cost you about $8-$10 ( ₹530- ₹716) for lunch and $12-$15 ( ₹850- ₹1,000) for dinner. If you want to tighten up on your food budget, look for hotels or guesthouses that include breakfast. Consider apartment rentals where you will have access to a kitchen. Even if you buy groceries and cook just a few times and always eat breakfast in the apartment, you will save money on your trip budget. Budget Plan For Activities Will you be using any tour guides on your vacation? Are there entrance fees for museums, parks, ruins or other attractions? Do you plan on doing something more expensive such as scuba diving or a hot-air balloon ride? Add up these travel costs too, and make sure you know which activities are inclusive and which ones are not. Do you like to shop when you travel? Plan accordingly for your fancies. How To Save For Your Travel Plans? For many millennials, travelling is more important than other financial goals such as buying a car, saving for a house or even investing for retirement. Some create a separate travel fund for holidays and put aside an amount, say ₹7500, every month. Systematic saving can enable you to fund holidays without depleting regular savings. The important point to consider is that if 'vacationing' is listed as a high-priority goal and savings are allocated towards this, you should also invest for goals such as retirement. Liquid or ultra-short debt funds are most suitable for travel goals within three to 12 months, as they do not attract exit load or volatility. For travel plans between three-five years, you can consider hybrid equity funds which have the possibility of higher returns with some volatility. The objective is not to earn high returns but to keep the money aside for a specific purpose. With an adequate pool of money at your disposal, you can clinch a good deal, instead of racking up debt or making a costlier last-minute booking.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/feature/explore/how-set-your-travel-budget-10595", "date": "2019-09-07T11:50:00+06:00", "author": "LiveMint 07 September, 2019, 11:50 am Last modified: 27 July, 2020, 06:01 pm", "category": "feature", "language": "en", "token_count": 596, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:31:29.759274"}
{"title": "US House passes bill to sanction Chinese banks over Hong Kong", "body": "The US House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday that would penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement a national security law that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a \"brutal, sweeping crackdown\" on Hong Kong. The measure passed by unanimous consent, reflecting concern in Washington over China's enactment of a security law seen as ending the autonomy that allowed the former British colony to thrive as an international financial center. The US Senate passed similar legislation last week, but under congressional rules the bill must return to the Senate and be passed there before being sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto. Earlier, Pelosi made an unusual appearance at a committee hearing on the situation in Hong Kong to say the security law marked the death of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle. \"The law is a brutal, sweeping crackdown against the people of Hong Kong, intended to destroy the freedoms they were promised,\" Pelosi said at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the security law was an affront to all nations and Washington would continue to implement Trump's directive to end the territory's special status.

{"title": "Govt approves import of 1 lakh tonne rice from India, Pakistan", "body": "The government has approved several proposals, including imports of rice, edible oil and lentils to strengthen food security and stabilise prices ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. The approvals were given at a meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase, today (23 December) at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at the Secretariat, with Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed presiding. The meeting recommended two proposals from the Ministry of Food to procure a total of 100,000 tonnes of rice. Of this, 50,000 tonnes of non-basmati parboiled rice will be imported from India through the international open tender method at an estimated cost of Tk217.53 crore, while another 50,000 tonnes of white rice will be imported from Pakistan under a government-to-government arrangement at around Tk241.52 crore. Officials said the rice imports would help maintain adequate public food stocks and curb market volatility during Ramadan when demand for essentials rises sharply. The Directorate General of Food will implement the procurement to ensure the timely arrival of consignments and strengthen buffer stocks. To keep edible oil prices stable, the meeting also approved the procurement of 4.75 crore litres of edible oil. This includes 1 crore litres of refined rice bran oil from local sources and 3.75 crore litres of soybean oil from international sources through direct purchase methods. The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh is expected to distribute the oil through subsidised sales across the country. In addition, the committee approved the procurement of 10,000 tonnes of lentils through the national open tender method at an estimated cost of Tk72.20 crore.

{"title": "To formalise the informal economy, Bangladesh must simplify business processes", "body": "Starting a business in Bangladesh remains a difficult and often discouraging journey. A significant number of entrepreneurial ideas fail at the ideation stage, long before they have a chance to develop into viable ventures. At the same time, the job market is shrinking, prompting many young people to dream of becoming entrepreneurs rather than spending years searching for suitable employment. But unfortunately, most struggle to sustain their initiatives due to complex regulatory procedures, bureaucratic non-cooperation, and the absence of a central advisory body to guide and encourage new entrepreneurs. In many countries, Entrepreneurship Development Programs (EDPs) have played a transformative role in nurturing new businesses. For example, in India, institutions like the National Institute for Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development (NIESBUD) have helped thousands of young entrepreneurs acquire practical skills, access finance, and receive mentorship, enabling many to establish successful ventures. While not all initiatives succeed, with proper dedication, some young entrepreneurs have even achieved global recognition. Similarly, Malaysia's SME Corp initiatives provide one-stop support systems, including training, incubators, and regulatory guidance, enabling small firms to scale quickly. Rwanda's YouthConnekt program also combines entrepreneurial training with access to funding and digital tools, significantly improving the survival rates of youth-led businesses. In Bangladesh, a number of institutions work to support entrepreneurs, such as BIDA, SME Foundation, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), City Corporations, Bangladesh Bank, and various NGOs. However, their responsibilities often overlap, requiring entrepreneurs to register with multiple organisations. The services to be provided are not clearly defined, resulting in the need for numerous licenses, approvals, permissions, and no-objection certificates — sometimes 15–30 regulatory requirements for a single entrepreneur. Multiple agencies, such as RJSC, Upazila and Union Parishads, DOE, BSTI, NBR, and others, each have their own processes and documentation. The lack of coordination among them leads to duplication, delays, higher costs, and confusion for entrepreneurs. Even in agriculture-related enterprises, ministries like Livestock, Fisheries, Women's Affairs, and Social Welfare act as sponsoring organisations providing registration for different purposes, but without clarity on the supportive measures or monitoring they provide for business sustainability. Due to these unclear pathways, most enterprises remain informal, avoiding the costs, procedures, and time-consuming hassles of formal registration. As a result, they often remain unsustainable and unable to benefit from the policy incentives announced by the government specifically for small and new entrepreneurs. Bangladesh's EDP initiatives have not delivered the expected outcomes. Challenges include fragmented programs run by multiple agencies, a shortage of skilled trainers, inadequate market-linkage support, and minimal follow-up after training. As a result, young entrepreneurs often feel lost after initial training, with no structured pathway for mentoring, financing, or navigating regulatory requirements. A more coordinated, demand-driven, and institutionally supported EDP framework along with a truly functional one-stop advisory mechanism could significantly strengthen Bangladesh's entrepreneurial ecosystem. Empowering young innovators is no longer optional; it is essential for economic diversification, job creation, and long-term competitiveness. While a few start-ups, mostly in the tech sector, are performing well, regulatory constraints and limited financial support remain significant barriers. Very recently, Bangladesh Bank announced a financial scheme to support both new and informal entrepreneurs, and this information should be widely publicised. Under the new CMSME refinancing policy, an entrepreneur will be considered \"new\" for four years after receiving their first credit. Informal entrepreneurs are identified as those using the Unified Business Identification Number (UBID), Digital Business Identification (DBID), or Personal Retail Account (PRA), as per Clause 1.9 of the circular. A credit limit of Tk 5 lakh has been set for these entrepreneurs. Cottage and micro entrepreneurs can also access this fund at the initial stage. Among the initial regulatory requirements, the trade license remains the most essential document for starting a business in Bangladesh. Banks typically will not provide financial support without it. However, the monitoring system for trade license holders is unclear, and in many cases, issuing authorities do not maintain an updated database of active licenses. Despite its importance, obtaining a trade license is widely recognised as a cumbersome process. Applicants often lack clear information about the time, cost, or steps required to secure this primary approval. Although Citizen Charters specify service timelines — such as 45 days for a factory license — actual approvals frequently take much longer due to administrative bottlenecks, reliance on manual and undocumented paperwork, and delays that often result in missed deadlines. Policies and reform measures aimed at improving the ease of doing business are often inconsistently implemented at the operational level. Limited accountability and weak coordination among implementing agencies contribute to persistent gaps between policy intentions and actual practice. Tax policies in Bangladesh are stringent, with confusing tax slabs and poorly defined HS codes that create additional complications. Frequent changes in tax rules and unclear interpretations further discourage new entrepreneurs. Obtaining utility connections — such as electricity, gas, and water — is another challenge, often involving long waiting periods and unofficial costs. Constraints in industrial land and infrastructure across many regions also increase setup expenses. A more coordinated, demand-driven, and institutionally supported EDP framework along with a truly functional one-stop advisory mechanism could significantly strengthen Bangladesh's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Empowering young innovators is no longer optional; it is essential for economic diversification, job creation, and long-term competitiveness. While a few start-ups, mostly in the tech sector, are performing well, regulatory constraints and limited financial support remain significant barriers. According to a study by BUILD, starting a manufacturing business in Bangladesh typically requires around 23 different licenses. Online systems, such as BIDA's One Stop Service portal, exist but remain only partially functional, often requiring physical follow-ups. Limited data integration among agencies further renders the process incomplete. On the demand side, entrepreneurs — especially small and new entrants — frequently lack clear information on procedures, required documents, and costs. The absence of dedicated help desks or transparent guidelines compounds these difficulties. Because of this complexity, many businesses choose to remain informal, which undermines transparency and discourages honest investors. Weak monitoring and the absence of performance evaluation have led to inefficiency among the agencies tasked with providing support services. Access to affordable finance is limited, and banks and financial institutions — often risk-averse — are constrained in supporting startups, venture capital, and angel investments, despite the sector's immense potential. In Bangladesh, over 84% of workers and 86% of private businesses operate informally, resulting in poor worker protections and reduced enterprise competitiveness. A recent ILO validation workshop on informality in Bangladesh highlighted that globally, more than two billion people work informally. In the Asia-Pacific region, approximately 66% of total employment — around 1.3 billion workers — is informal, and more than eight in ten enterprises in the region operate informally (2024). Without the formalisation of enterprises, employment formalisation is not possible. A survey conducted in Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, and Khulna, with a total sample size of 384, sought to understand the state of informality in Bangladesh. The findings revealed that only 47% of respondents were fully registered, and just 9.6% of surveyed workers had written contracts. The most significant barrier to employment formalisation was a complex registration process, followed by a lack of benefits. Comparisons with countries such as India, Nepal, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam show that various good practices have been adopted to address informality. Examples include India's UDYAM MSME Registration Portal, the Philippines' eGovPH Super-App, and Colombia's PILA (Planilla Integrada de Liquidación de Aportes), all designed to create a more business-friendly environment for SMEs. The transition from informality to formalisation must pass through specific stages and phases, guided by an understanding of the current level of formality. It is also important to assess the contribution of the informal economy to GDP and to determine whether a low Tax-to-GDP ratio is one of the factors driving informality. At the post-LDC graduation stage, Bangladesh needs a fully digital, simplified business registration and licensing system accessible through a single platform. The goal is to reduce informality and strengthen the country's presence in global supply chains. Small and new entrepreneurs who often lack experience in starting a venture require clear guidance, streamlined procedures, and user-friendly services. Such support will encourage them to pursue entrepreneurship with confidence, gain proper recognition, and acquire the knowledge necessary for long-term sustainability.

{"title": "Biman’s lease blunder", "body": "Biman Bangladesh Airlines leased two aircraft from EgyptAir in 2014 to fly them for five years, but in reality, it could put them in use for only a year, causing the national flag carrier a huge loss. And not only that, it had to finally return one aircraft in July this year by paying the Egyptian airlines a penalty of Tk35 crore. Biman wants but cannot return the other plane too because the aircraft could not be made airworthy – a precondition that the plane must be returned in its original condition. Both aircraft remained grounded because of engine defects since 2017. Biman had to waste about Tk1,300 crore on the two Boeing 777-200ERs – as lease amount and on repairs and replacement of engines. Industry insiders now question the deal of Biman to lease such old aircraft, and more so because the money it had spent on the two Boeings could easily be used to snap up two brand new planes if another Tk700 crore was spent. Biman purchased a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner for around Tk1,000 crore which was added to the fleet in July this year. The price of each of the EgyptAir aircrafts would be almost half of that. The waste on these age-old planes ultimately hit the bottom line of Biman that suffered a loss of Tk201 crore in 2017-18. The company was making profits for the previous three years in a row. Since then, Biman was in the process of returning the aircrafts to the lessor to stop further bleeding, one of which has been completed. The other aircraft is now under maintenance by Vietnam Airlines Engineering Company (VAECO), a maintenance and engineering subsidiary of Vietnam Airlines. It is likely to be returned to EgyptAir this month after a test flight. \"Aviation ministry initiated return of the aircraft to save Biman from further losses,\" Md Mohibul Haque, secretary of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, told The Business Standard. One was returned but the other could not be because of Biman's non-cooperation, he said. Action was taken against two Biman officials for creating barrier to returning the leased aircraft, he said. \"The parliamentary standing committee on aviation ministry has initiated an investigation to find out the persons responsible for the lease,\" he said. In the latest development, the Board of Biman has taken punitive actions against two officials for their alleged involvement in delaying the return of the aircrafts. According to a Biman report, of the total amount the company spent on the two Boeings, around Tk700 crore was paid to EgyptAir for rent until February 2019, around Tk300 crore for the lease of four engines from EgyptAir, around Tk280 crore to the US-based United Airlines for engine repair, and around Tk7 crore to VAECO. How it all started Between 2013 and 2014, two old Biman aircraft were removed from the fleet, resulting in a shortage. It then leased the aircraft from EgyptAir to fill the shortage. However, the aircraft did not help Biman increase its fleet capacity. Rather, they became an extra burden due to inefficient dealing with the lessor, creating huge trouble for the national flag carrier. For instance, the age of the aircraft and its engine condition are the major factors to consider while taking out a lease. But Biman compromised on both factors. The aircraft it leased were 18 years old. The spare parts of such old aircrafts are not readily available in the market. Also, it took Pratt and Whitney engines for the aircraft, and their spare parts are also unavailable. An aircraft that has been leased is required to be returned in its previous condition according to the lease agreement, but Biman paid compensation for returning one as its spare parts were not available. Because Biman's manpower was familiar with only General Electric (GE) Aviation engine, the company had to invest extra money to train the workers to operate Pratt and Whitney engines, according to a Biman review report on the lease of the aircraft. Despite having the two aircraft grounded for two years, their return was being delayed due to unavailability of the necessary parts of such old aircrafts, according to the report. The analysis made before the lease showed that the aircraft were not financially viable. But then managing director of Biman, Kevin John Steel, defended the lease, saying that growing the fleet capacity and operation will reduce overhead costs and increase profit. Lease process Any Bangladeshi airline can take out two types of lease. One is a dry lease, which is taken for more than a year. The other, wet lease, is taken for a maximum of one year. Wet lease is taken out on a temporary basis to operate Hajj flights or during special occasions. In case of wet lease, the provider of the plane will bear all costs of the aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance while the user of the plane will pay only the hourly rent. For dry lease, the user will bear all costs and pay monthly rent to the supplier. How Biman was harassed by EgyptAir In March 2014, one Boeing 777-200ER (registration No. S2-AHL) was leased from EgyptAir and a month later, another similar aircraft (registration No. S2-AHK) joined Biman's fleet. Both aircrafts provided uninterrupted service for a year until February 2015 when one engine of an aircraft was affected by sulfidation. Sulfidation is a chemical reaction that occurs at high-temperature ranges. Sulfur contained in the aircraft's fuel combines with salt and other airborne contaminants in the intake air to create a corrosive mixture that attacks metal components. Sulfidation could lead to major engine damage if proper maintenance is not done. Biman did a check-up and found that all four engines of both planes had some problems. It decided to keep one of the aircrafts grounded and sent the engines to United Airlines for repair at intervals. The other one was also grounded later. While repairing, United Airlines found that most of the engine parts are irreparable and need to be replaced. Even the manufacturer of the engine, Pratt and Whitney, could not provide the necessary parts. On May 5, 2017, Pratt and Whitney wrote to the Biman managing director, apologising for its inability to provide spare parts. When Biman contacted EgyptAir, it agreed to bear a portion of the parts replacement costs. Meanwhile, Biman was incurring huge losses because of the grounded aircraft. It then leased four more engines from EgyptAir to keep the aircraft operational. Two of the engines were leased in November 2015 and faults were detected again within nine months, in August 2016. Biman had to repair those engines as per the terms of the lease. For this, Biman had to spend around Tk11 crore. The two other engines were also found faulty within a year and Biman decided to return those to EgyptAir. As part of the returning process, Biman requested the lessor to relax the return conditions. But EgyptAir did not grant the request. Rather, it warned that Biman would have to bear the total repair cost – which it said might be up to Tk350 crore – if the condition of the engines was found to have deteriorated beyond the limit. Biman then hurriedly repaired the two engines and returned them to EgyptAir in July 2017. A month later, Biman went for early termination of the EgyptAir lease agreement. Captain Ishrat Ahmed, director of flight operation of Biman, led the team that inspected the two aircraft before the lease was finalised and labelled them satisfactory. Shafiqul Alam Siddique, then head of engineer of Biman, led the team that accepted the delivery of both aircraft in 2014.

{"title": "ADB to lend $142m for improving rural road network, transport connectivity", "body": "The government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed two agreements for $142 million in concessional loans to be used for improving the rural road network and transport connectivity. Fatima Yasmin, secretary of the Economic Relations Division (ERD), and Manmohan Parkash, country director of the regional lending agency, remotely signed the loan agreement on behalf of their respective sides on Tuesday. The ongoing rural road network improvement project will get another $100 million for further expansion. Manmohan Parkash said the project will contribute to the government's efforts to achieve faster socio-economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic ends. He said the expanded project will benefit around 92 million inhabitants in 34 districts with access to better health services, education, employment opportunities, markets and other government services. \"In addition to generating 1.73 million person-days of employment through infrastructure spending, the additional financing will also widen opportunities for women and children to get easier and safer access to education, emergency health services, and other essential social services in any weather condition,\" he added. This additional financing will scale up the current road network under the Rural Connectivity Improvement Project from 1,700km to 2,630km of rural roads. It will build upon the $200 million financial package approved in 2018 to upgrade rural roads in 34 districts to all-weather standards with climate resilience and safety features. The project supports the government's 7th Five-Year Plan to increase the percentage of the country's rural roads classified as good from 43 percent in 2016 to 80 percent in 2020. ADB said the overall project will continue to strengthen governance and institutional capacity in rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads with the use of a geographic information system to optimise monitoring of road conditions. Inadequate rural transport and poor market infrastructure are critical challenges to Bangladesh's rural development, the ADB said, adding that the situation is further worsened by recurrent flooding and disasters that paralyse agricultural value chains. Less than half of the rural population has access to roads made for all weathers, which make up less than a third of the total length of rural roads in the country. The ADB is also providing $42 million in concessional loans to prepare road and railway sector projects for promoting multimodal transport connectivity in Bangladesh. Parkash said Bangladesh needs to boost connectivity between different transport modes, strengthen multimodal and arterial transport corridors, as well as construct bypass and connecting roads to promote domestic and international trade. He added that given the impact of Covid-19, improving transport connectivity is critical for ensuring a robust local and global supply chain. Highlighting the opportunities that such projects would offer for the private sector, the ADB country director noted that multimodal transport can accelerate economic activities, including international trade. \"It will also help accelerate economic activities by reducing transportation costs and time, and increasing competitiveness and efficiency,\" he said. This project is supported by a project readiness financing (PRF) loan, which is an innovative financing instrument introduced in 2018. \"Through this project, we are supporting the government's initiative to prepare the transport sector's complex projects very well so that they are implemented quickly and efficiently,\" Parkash added. The total cost of the facility is $57.2 million, of which the government will provide $15.2 million. The PRF is due for completion at the end of 2024. The Transport Connectivity Improvement Preparatory Facility project will help with feasibility studies; detailed design; risk assessment for gender, labour, and other social issues; environmental impact assessments; climate risk and vulnerability assessments; environmental management plans; resettlement plans; and risk mitigation plans for ensuing projects. The PRF will support project preparation in road and rail connectivity of ports, land ports, and border crossing points. It will also support road and rail connectivity of intermodal transhipment facilities, including inland container depots and inland container terminals, and the strengthening of corridors. Sector-wide improvements including safety, traffic management and maintenance will also be supported by the PRF.

{"title": "Shoigu says Russia supports China's position on Taiwan", "body": "Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that Moscow continues to support Beijing over Taiwan, state news agency TASS reported on Sunday. China and Russia have forged close ties in recent years and declared a \"no limits\" strategic partnership days before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not renounced using force to bring it under its control. Beijing has offered Taiwan a \"one country, two systems\" model, similar to Hong Kong, though no major political party in Taiwan supports this. Russia has repeatedly said it opposes Taiwan's independence in any form and considers the island an inseparable part of China. \"We see that China's ill-wishers continue to destabilise the situation in the Taiwan Strait. For our part, I want to reaffirm our consistent and unwavering support for Beijing on the Taiwan issue,\" Shoigu said, according to TASS news agency. \"We proceed from the fact that the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China,\" he added. Shoigu, a former Russian defence minister, arrived in China earlier on Sunday. The Russian Security Council said Shoigu and Wang Yi would meet to discuss security issues. Wang said China and Russia have an \"obligation\" to practise multilateralism and to advocate for an equal and orderly multipolar world, according to a readout from the Chinese foreign ministry. China's top diplomat called on both countries to maintain close communication on major issues related to bilateral relations and increase mutual support for each other's core interests. China is willing to work with Russia to strengthen strategic communication, deepen strategic coordination and enhance bilateral ties this year, Wang said. The trip coincides with talks between Russia, Ukraine and US officials aimed at ending the almost four-year-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Shoigu also met Wang in December in Moscow.

They also said it would be difficult to reach the goal by 2030 if all the universities in the country do not work properly. The online seminar titled \"Role of Universities in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals\" was organised by the Innovation Creation and Entrepreneurship Centre of Dhaka University on Wednesday to mark the 99th founding anniversary of the university. At the programme Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University Professor Akhtaruzzaman said the planners who work for developing the universities must have a good mindset and management skills. \"We need a big budget for overall development including research and innovation at the universities. But we are not getting that. In this situation how will we contribute in nation building activities?\" he asked. \"Yes, we have responsibilities to gain the SDGs and we have started work in this regard. We are going to revise our curriculum,\" he added. Professor Dr Shamsul Alam, member of the General Economic Division of the Planning Commission, said sustainable development is essential for our existence and prosperity. \"Dhaka University contributed in building the nation, bringing independence and making us prosper. So, we believe that we will achieve the SDGs under the leadership of the university,\" he said. \"Universities including Dhaka University have a responsibility to make their graduates skilled for the future world. The graduates must have knowledge about SDGs and other plans,\" he opined. Dr Alam further said the industries now import skilled manpower from India, Sri Lanka and other countries. But our universities failed to produce such qualified graduates. \"We have to think more about why we failed here,\" he said. Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue Professor Dr Mustafizur Rahman said university graduates are now implementing a plan to achieve SDGs in rural areas, and they are doing it with high skill. \"The work for SDGs will be better if we can connect the implementers with the universities,\" he said. President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Shams Mahmud said innovation and research are two basic pillars of achieving SDGs. Only universities can perform it perfectly. Khurshid Alam, assistant residential representative of the United Nations Development Programme, said the Dhaka University changed the nation, and the responsibility to achieve the SDGs is now on its shoulder. \"Research is the best way to find out the way to implement the tools for achieving SDGs. The Dhaka University can contribute here,\" he said.

{"title": "Textile giants' profits slump on falling yarn prices, rising costs", "body": "Infographic: TBS Bangladesh's leading textile companies reported a noticeable slowdown in business during the October–December quarter of FY26, as falling yarn prices, weak global demand and rising production costs combined to erode both revenue and profitability across the sector. Financial statements show that most giant spinners and textile manufacturers posted year-on-year declines in revenue during the quarter. Malek Spinning's revenue fell 6% to Tk673 crore, while Square Textiles saw a sharper 14% drop to Tk580 crore. Envoy Textiles' turnover declined by 10% to Tk412 crore, Shasha Denims' revenue slipped 4% to Tk328 crore, Matin Spinning recorded a 2% fall to Tk215 crore, and Fareast Knitting's revenue dropped 7% to Tk201 crore. The pressure on the top line was reflected more severely in profits, highlighting how declining yarn prices compressed margins yarn. Malek Spinning's profit dropped 37% to Tk31.85 crore, while Square Textiles suffered one of the steepest falls, with profit plunging 93% to Tk2.77 crore. Shasha Denims' profit declined 65% to Tk3.95 crore, Matin Spinning's fell 36% to Tk9.91 crore, and Fareast Knitting saw profit collapse by 99% to just Tk0.10 crore. Envoy Textiles stood out as an exception, posting a marginal 1% increase in profit to Tk35 crore despite lower revenue. Company disclosures indicate that the sharp fall in yarn prices was a key driver behind the weaker performance. Square Textiles said its net profit declined significantly due to a notable drop in yarn prices alongside higher finance costs. With selling prices falling faster than input costs, mills struggled to protect their margins even when production volumes remained stable. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Malek Spinning also cited margin pressure in its quarterly statement, noting that the cost of goods sold rose in the second quarter as sales prices declined compared to raw material prices, while factory overheads increased. The company added that export demand weakened during the period, contributing to lower sales and gross profit, which ultimately dragged down net earnings. Envoy Textiles painted a mixed picture. While its fabric exports increased by 12% during the quarter, cotton yarn exports plunged by 65%, weighing on overall revenue. Speaking to The Business Standard, company secretary Saiful Islam Chowdhury said the firm has gradually shifted away from exporting yarn as more output is consumed internally. Yarn exports, which once accounted for around 40% of total production, have now fallen to about 20%, reflecting changes in business strategy amid volatile prices. Shasha Denims attributed its profit decline mainly to a sharp rise in the cost of goods sold combined with lower selling prices, which significantly compressed gross margins. The company said earnings were partially supported by consistent profit contributions from associate companies, preventing an even steeper fall in net profit. Matin Spinning's results also underscored the impact of weaker yarn prices. The company said revenue declined despite higher sales volume because the average selling price per kilogram dropped from $3.68 to $3.47. Although cost efficiencies helped improve its gross profit margin, the lower price environment still weighed on overall performance. Industry insiders say the challenges facing textile mills go beyond price fluctuations. Production costs have risen by around 30% over the past two years due to higher gas prices, wage hikes and irregular gas supply, making it difficult for mills to compete with imported yarn. According to data from the National Board of Revenue, cotton yarn imports surged 39% in 2024 to $2.28 billion, while fabric imports by knitwear factories jumped 38% to $2.59 billion, intensifying competition for local producers. Mill owners also point to reduced government incentives for using local yarn, with cash incentives cut sharply and long delays in disbursement further discouraging garment exporters from sourcing domestically. At the same time, higher gas tariffs, stricter bank loan conditions and allegations of illegal yarn imports have added to the sector's woes. While the government is considering higher tariffs on yarn imports to protect local spinners, industry leaders warn that without addressing structural cost pressures and restoring competitiveness, falling yarn prices will continue to squeeze revenues and profits in the months ahead. Bangladesh's leading textile companies reported a noticeable slowdown in business during the October–December quarter of FY26, as falling yarn prices, weak global demand and rising production costs combined to erode both revenue and profitability across the sector. Financial statements show that most giant spinners and textile manufacturers posted year-on-year declines in revenue during the quarter. Malek Spinning's revenue fell 6% to Tk673 crore, while Square Textiles saw a sharper 14% drop to Tk580 crore. Envoy Textiles' turnover declined by 10% to Tk412 crore, Shasha Denims' revenue slipped 4% to Tk328 crore, Matin Spinning recorded a 2% fall to Tk215 crore, and Fareast Knitting's revenue dropped 7% to Tk201 crore. The pressure on the top line was reflected more severely in profits, highlighting how declining yarn prices compressed margins yarn. Malek Spinning's profit dropped 37% to Tk31.85 crore, while Square Textiles suffered one of the steepest falls, with profit plunging 93% to Tk2.77 crore. Shasha Denims' profit declined 65% to Tk3.95 crore, Matin Spinning's fell 36% to Tk9.91 crore, and Fareast Knitting saw profit collapse by 99% to just Tk0.10 crore. Envoy Textiles stood out as an exception, posting a marginal 1% increase in profit to Tk35 crore despite lower revenue. Company disclosures indicate that the sharp fall in yarn prices was a key driver behind the weaker performance. Square Textiles said its net profit declined significantly due to a notable drop in yarn prices alongside higher finance costs. With selling prices falling faster than input costs, mills struggled to protect their margins even when production volumes remained stable. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Malek Spinning also cited margin pressure in its quarterly statement, noting that the cost of goods sold rose in the second quarter as sales prices declined compared to raw material prices, while factory overheads increased. The company added that export demand weakened during the period, contributing to lower sales and gross profit, which ultimately dragged down net earnings. Envoy Textiles painted a mixed picture. While its fabric exports increased by 12% during the quarter, cotton yarn exports plunged by 65%, weighing on overall revenue. Speaking to The Business Standard, company secretary Saiful Islam Chowdhury said the firm has gradually shifted away from exporting yarn as more output is consumed internally. Yarn exports, which once accounted for around 40% of total production, have now fallen to about 20%, reflecting changes in business strategy amid volatile prices. Shasha Denims attributed its profit decline mainly to a sharp rise in the cost of goods sold combined with lower selling prices, which significantly compressed gross margins. The company said earnings were partially supported by consistent profit contributions from associate companies, preventing an even steeper fall in net profit. Matin Spinning's results also underscored the impact of weaker yarn prices. The company said revenue declined despite higher sales volume because the average selling price per kilogram dropped from $3.68 to $3.47. Although cost efficiencies helped improve its gross profit margin, the lower price environment still weighed on overall performance. Industry insiders say the challenges facing textile mills go beyond price fluctuations. Production costs have risen by around 30% over the past two years due to higher gas prices, wage hikes and irregular gas supply, making it difficult for mills to compete with imported yarn. According to data from the National Board of Revenue, cotton yarn imports surged 39% in 2024 to $2.28 billion, while fabric imports by knitwear factories jumped 38% to $2.59 billion, intensifying competition for local producers. Mill owners also point to reduced government incentives for using local yarn, with cash incentives cut sharply and long delays in disbursement further discouraging garment exporters from sourcing domestically.

The incident took place around noon in Gangannandapur union where at least 10 people were reportedly injured. However, Jhikargacha Police Station Officer-in-Charge Dewan Mohammad Shahjalal Alam told The Business Standard that the incident involved only a minor scuffle between the two groups. \"Police visited the spot. The situation is now under control and the matter is being investigated,\" he added. According to local Jamaat leaders, 10-12 women Jamaat activists were campaigning in Shrichandrapur village when several BNP activists obstructed them and used abusive language. Later, leaders and activists of Jamaat's youth wings went to the area to calm the situation, but an argument broke out between the two sides. Jamaat leaders alleged that BNP activists then attacked them with pipes, bamboo sticks and iron rods, leaving at least 10 Jamaat and Islami Chhatra Shibir activists injured. Former Jhikargacha upazila Shibir secretary Mustakim Hasan claimed that BNP activists had been gathering in the area earlier. \"When Jamaat's women activists went there to seek votes, they were attacked. Several people, including me, were injured,\" he said. BNP, however, denied the allegations and claimed that Jamaat activists initiated the violence. BNP leaders alleged that Jamaat supporters arrived wearing outfits resembling bulletproof jackets and attacked BNP activists, triggering the clash. BNP candidate for Jashore-2 constituency, Sabira Nazmul Munni, said Jamaat activists came prepared and carried out the attack first. \"Our activists were assaulted, and only then did the situation turn violent,\" she alleged.

The British company, which makes engines for the Boeing 787 and Airbus 350, said flying hours fell 75 percent in April, May and June, and it had only seen a marginal improvement since. Chief Executive Warren East said Rolls had started reviewing options for strengthening its balance sheet, and it had 8.1 billion pounds at hand even after the first-half outflow. \"The Covid-19 pandemic has created a shock across the entire civil aviation industry,\" East told reporters on Thursday. \"Across the first half of this year, widebody engine flying hours, which we get paid for under our servicing contract, were half of what they were last year.\" Rolls has announced at least 9,000 job cuts, mainly in its civil aviation business, which has born the brunt of the coronavirus impact. Its defence business had been resilient, East said, while power systems had been impacted in part. East said sites could be cut as well as jobs. He said the restructuring would drive a recovery in free cash inflow to at least 750 million pounds in 2022. Its shares, which are down 58 percent since the start of the year, were down 8 percent at 265 pence at 0821 GMT. Analysts at JP Morgan, who have argued that Rolls needs to issue 6 billion pounds of equity to ensure its future, said the trading update was \"materially worse\" than its expectations. \"If there is a second wave of Covid-19 or a slower than hoped for recovery then it is very possible, in our view, that the UK government will need to step in to save Rolls-Royce,\" they said. The first-half outflow included a 1.1 billion pound fall in engine flying hours receipts and deliveries and a 1.1 billion pound hit from the voluntary end of invoice factoring, which it used to align cash receipts with deliveries, Rolls said.

European football's governing body added in a statement that the same arrangements would apply to the outstanding second-leg matches in the Europa League round of 16 ties. Uefa also said that all matches in European club competition would be played without spectators until further notice, a measure it described as prudent. The Champions League ties still to be completed are Manchester City v Real Madrid, Bayern Munich v Chelsea, Juventus v Olympique Lyonnais and Barcelona v Napoli. The matches are due to be played on Aug 7-8. City lead Real 2-1, Bayern are 3-0 up against Chelsea, Juve trail Lyon 1-0 while Barca and Napoli are level at 1-1. Uefa said the decision on the fixture arrangements was \"consistent with the principle of sporting fairness\" and took into account the fact that all four home teams are currently playing domestic matches in their own stadiums. However, Uefa added that it would monitor the situation and move matches to Portugal if \"new events occur that would make it impossible to play one or more matches at the original venues.\" The final stages of the Champions League, from the quarter-finals onwards, will be played as a mini-tournament in Portugal and the Europa League in Germany, with the draws to be made on Friday.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 20th league goal of the season looked like handing the hosts a fourth successive win to maintain their late push for a top-four finish. Visiting keeper Kasper Schmeichel made several fine saves to keep Leicester in the game after Aubameyang's 21st-minute goal, but the visitors came back strongly in the second half. Arsenal had Nketiah sent off in the 75th minute for a reckless tackle on James Justin — a decision made after referee Chris Kavanagh viewed a pitch-side monitor. Leicester then levelled in the 84th minute as Premier League top scorer Vardy found space at the far post to tap home Demarai Gray's low cross for his 22nd goal of the season. Vardy had an anxious wait as the decision was checked by VAR for a possible offside but the goal stood and the Foxes looked favourites to grab a late winner and claim their first league win at Arsenal since 1973. They had to make do with a point, however, although that will be a relief for manager Brendan Rodgers whose side had earlier been leapfrogged in the table by Chelsea. Leicester, who have won only twice in 10 league games, are four points above fifth-placed Manchester United who have a game in hand. Arsenal would have closed the gap on Leicester to six points had they managed to hold on but remained nine back in seventh spot with four games remaining. \"We should have been three or four nil up in the first half,\" Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. \"We lost two points, we lost Eddie and we will see now for how many games. But we go to Spurs (on Sunday) now and try to win three points.\" Leicester began the game in sprightly fashion but were rocked when Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka played a sliderule pass across the greasy surface for Aubameyang to slot home. The hosts were rampant for a while and Schmeichel made crucial saves to deny Alexandre Lacazette, Hector Bellerin and Saka as Leicester wobbled. Arsenal were less of a threat after the break, however, and Vardy scuffed one effort when he should have scored. Nketiah's red card paved the way for more late pressure and Arsenal finally cracked as Vardy struck. \"I think this is a really, really important point for us to keep the momentum going,\" Rodgers said. \"My only disappointment is that we didn't go on and win the game.\" Arsenal / Leicester / English Premier League / Jamie Vardy", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/vardys-late-strike-earns-leicester-point-arsenal-103396", "date": "2020-07-08T12:45:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 08 July, 2020, 12:45 pm Last modified: 08 July, 2020, 12:52 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 451, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:32:14.270787"}

The court cleared Kim, who is the wife of ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol who was ousted from office last year, on charges of stock price manipulation and violating the political funds act. The ruling, which can be appealed by the former first lady or prosecutors, comes amid a series of trials following investigations into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law in 2024 and related scandals involving the once-powerful couple. Prosecutors had demanded 15 years in jail and fines of 2.9 billion won ($2 million) over accusations that include accepting luxury Chanel bags and a diamond necklace from South Korea's Unification Church in return for political favours. The court found there was not sufficient evidence to conclude Kim was guilty of manipulating stock prices and violating political funding laws, by receiving opinion polls from a power broker in return for influencing the choice of poll candidates. Kim had denied all the charges. Her lawyer said the team would review the ruling and decide whether to appeal the bribery conviction. Kim walked into the courtroom at the Seoul Central District Court clad in a dark suit and wearing a face mask, and sat quietly as the lead judge of a three-justice bench delivered the verdict. The Unification Church said the gifts were delivered to her without expecting anything. Its leader Han Hak-ja, who is also on trial, has denied that she directed it to bribe Kim. Yoon, who was ousted from power last April, also faces eight trials on charges including insurrection, after his failed bid to impose martial law in December 2024.

Its first phase is targeted to open on December 16, 2021 – the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence. According to engineers of the project, when the government declared general holidays in late March amid the pandemic, Japanese consultants and staff involved in the project, left Bangladesh immediately and monitored the work regularly from that country. Later, when the virus situation worsened, many local staff and workers also left the project sites as they were unwilling to work amid the pandemic. The authorities did not force them to work and the entire project gradually stalled. Sources said the authorities now want to resume the work, complying with health rules, although the situation is still not favourable. The engineers said a few project workers, who were suspected of having Covid-19, have been in quarantine and will go back to work once they recover. MRT Line-6 is an elevated metro rail system currently being built in Dhaka, under a fast-track priority initiative of the government. The project is jointly financed by the government and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica). The project was already delayed by a 2016 terror attack on Holey Artisan café in Gulshan – killing 22 people including seven Japanese nationals. Work on the Line 6 project was disrupted for six months following the attack. Uncertainty is now looming large over the planned launch of Line-6's 11.7-kilometre segment at the end of next year. If the pandemic lingers, the uncertainty may further increase. Yet, the government seems determined to launch the project according to the stipulated schedule and has vowed to put forward its greatest efforts to recover the losses. Md Nazrul Islam, DMTCL board chairman and secretary of the Road Transport and Highways Division, told The Business Standard that, considering the current situation, the government is planning its future course of action. When asked if the launch of the project may be delayed, he replied in the affirmative. \"[But] if the current situation improves and we can resume full-fledged work in August, we expect to complete the Uttara-Agargaon 11.7-km segment by the end of 2021. We will assess the work in upcoming January.\" \"There has already been significant progress on the project. The bogies of the rails are being manufactured in Japan. A bogie has already been brought to Dhaka from Japan. A few more sets have been ordered. We hope the work will end in due time there,\" he added. He further said all experts, consultants and employees on the project are concerned about the project deadline and dedicated to complete the project's first phase by the end of next year. The project is divided into eight construction packages which will cost around Tk22,000 crore. Of the amount, Jica will provide Tk16,500 crore. Once implemented, MRT Line 6 will run from Uttara to Motijheel – serving 16 stations along the way. Trains for the metro rail will have the capacity to transport 60,000 passengers per hour from Uttara to Motijheel. The stations of the metro rail will be at: Uttara North, Central Uttara, Uttara South, Pallabi, Mirpur 11, Mirpur 10, Kazipara, Shewrapara, Agargaon, Bijoy Sharani, Farmgate, Karwan Bazar, Shahbag, Dhaka University, the Secretariat, and Motijheel. It will take 35 minutes to reach Motijheel from Uttara. The station will be as high as a three-storey building and will be accessible by escalators and lifts. Ticket counters and other facilities will be available on the second floor. The authorities said 12 trains will run on the routes. MRT Line 6 is a part of the 20-year-long Strategic Transport Plan (STP) chalked out by the government. To implement the STP, Bangladesh's government invited Jica to conduct a primary survey and feasibility study on the transport system of Dhaka back in 2009-2010. In 2012, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved the MRT Line 6 project. A loan agreement between Bangladesh's government and Jica was signed in January 2013. In order to plan, conduct surveys, design, finance, construct, maintain and operate metro rails in Dhaka, DMTCL was established on June 3, 2013. The general consultant commenced work in February 2014. The Metro Rail Act was approved in Parliament in January 2015.

{"title": "Distance learning: Huawei to provide tech supports for students", "body": "In order to facilitate distance learning, the Huawei Bangladesh has partnered with Bijoy Digital to provide digital solutions for school going students. The project named 'Bridging the Digital Education Divide to Reduce the Gap' under this partnership, will provide Huawei smart devices, Bijoy Digital App and connectivity for students (pre-school level to fourth grade) studying at T&T High schools across the country. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation is patronising the project, said a media statement issued on Wednesday. The initiative was announced through a virtual ceremony on Wednesday. Mustafa Jabbar, minister for posts, telecommunications and information technology, joined the programme as the chief guest. Among others, Md Nur-Ur-Rahman, secretary to the same ministry, Dr Md. Rafiqul Matin, managing director, Bangladesh Telecommunication Company Limited, Beatrice Kaldun, head of office and Unesco Representative in Bangladesh, Jasmine Jui, CEO at Bijoy Digital, Halima Begum, head teacher, T&T Boys High School, Banani, and and Zhang Zhengjun, CEO of Huawei Technologies (Bangladesh) Limited, joined the event. According to the media release, since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, all the schools in the country have been shut down to maintain social distancing, and it leads millions of children to be out of the education system. Though many schools have restarted their operations through distance learning a higher percentage of the student population do not have access to digital technology. Thus, digital technology with complimentary access to devices can transform the education sector and increase the rate of literacy across the nation even during the pandemic, the press release read. Initially, the project will start with T&T Boys High School in Banani and then move forward to other schools in two years. Huawei, in this regard, will provide Huawei Tab (Huawei MediaPad T3 10) to students and teachers to T&T Boys High School, Banani in Dhaka to empower the process of digital education. Bijay Digital will enable students to follow the national curriculum of Bangladesh in a digital innovative way. All the tabs will have pre-installed Bijay Digital apps. By February 2021, the entities will ensure to provide the digital solutions for two other schools and will finish the project in August 2022. Minister Mustafa Jabbar said, \"Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, educational institutions in the country remain closed to prevent further spread of the virus. But the government has been relentlessly working to find and apply alternate ways to ensure the continuity of learning.\" \"I find so much confidence when I see Huawei is realising the facts in the education sector and collaborating with local and UN organisations, took the initiative to distribute digital solutions to the students who do not have access to study,\" he added.

{"title": "General insurance sector share prices soar amid earning decline", "body": "Investors in the stock market witnessed a sudden 4.2 percent return on general insurance sector shares last week while the earnings of 60 percent of the companies decreased in the first quarter of the current financial year. In the last week, general insurance held 9.7 percent of total turnover at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). The market capitalisation of general insurance is only Tk4,652 crore or 1.8 percent of total market capital at the DSE. The price earnings ratio stood at 11.7 while the DSE price earnings ratio was 15.85. A top official of a leading brokerage house, on condition of anonymity, said that most of the general insurance companies have low capital. \"So, the investors can easily manipulate their share price. Otherwise there is no reason to increase their share price on the floor price mechanism,\" he said. General insurance business mostly depends on letters of credit for export-import. However, amid the pandemic, export-import businesses are under pressure, he added. Among the 35 general insurance companies listed on the DSE, 17 companies declared dividends to their shareholders for the 2019 financial year, and 15 of them published a first quarter earnings report this year. Out of the enlisted companies, only Prime Insurance failed to pay a dividend to its shareholders and two companies - named Peoples Insurance Company Limited and Paramount Insurance Company Ltd paid dividends below 10 percent. Dividends of 56 percent of companies remain unchanged, while 78 percent of companies posted moderate growth last year. The highest 25 percent cash dividend was paid by Reliance Insurance and their earnings also grew by 18 percent for the 2019 financial year. In the first quarter of the current year, it posted a 21 percent growth in its earnings. Meanwhile, 15 companies in the general insurance sector published their first quarter reports of the current financial year. Out of the 60 percent companies, profit declined due to the worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus, while two companies named Prime Insurance and Paramount Insurance posted losses. United Insurance has published its half yearly report of this year. The company posted a 59 percent fall in profit during the period. In the countrywide general holiday period, the company's profit declined by 74 percent. Sheikh Kabir Hossain, president of Bangladesh Insurance Association told The Business Standard that they were facing tough times due to an economic slowdown in the pandemic period. Seeking anonymity, a senior official of a leading insurance company said that in the last year insurance regulators had strictly banned unethical commission business in this sector and fixed the operational expense limit. In this regard many companies lost their businesses, but this loss was for a short time. This regulatory movement will play a positive role in the future, he added. A market insider said that to convince consumers to buy an insurance policy, the industry was reliant on agents who persistently contact potential clients. \"These agents have to be paid a portion of the first year's premium as well as a smaller percentage of future premiums collected from the customer. To encourage these agents, insurers may offer commissions up to 70 percent. These practises are badly affecting claims settlement,\" he added. According to LightCastle Partners, as most companies are concentrated in urban areas, there is a large market in rural areas that is not being accessed. A lack of enabling regulations, infrastructure, and market data limits the quality of insurance products, as well as their coverage. This is evident as even though Motor Third Party Liability insurance is compulsory, it only has a penetration of 70 percent, says the consulting firm. Insurers earn returns on the assets they invest with funds raised from premiums collected. Policy mandates that 30 percent of the funds be invested in government securities and the remainder can be invested in shares, fixed assets and fixed deposits.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/stock/general-insurance-sector-share-prices-soar-amid-earning-decline-105778", "date": "2020-07-13T21:55:00+06:00", "author": "Ahsan Habib Tuhin 13 July, 2020, 09:55 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 09:10 am", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 641, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:32:31.210795"}
{"title": "Nadal and Williams headline party for all ages at U.S. Open", "body": "There will be something for every age at the U.S. Open this weekend with golden oldies Rafa Nadal and Serena Williams looking for more U.S. Open Grand Slam glory and Daniil Medvedev and teenager Bianca Andreescu poised to usher in a new era. Nadal booked his place in a fifth U.S. Open final in familiar fashion on Saturday, out-muscling big-hitting Italian Matteo Berrettini 7-6(6) 6-4 6-1 to set up an intriguing Sunday showdown against Russian villain Medvedev, who seems to have as many weapons in his tennis arsenal as personalities. With Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic having been shown the Flushing Meadows exit, Nadal is the last member of the Big Three still standing so it will be up to the Spaniard to extend the old guard’s run of 11 consecutive Grand Slam wins. A fourth U.S. Open title would also give the 33-year-old Spaniard 19 Grand Slams moving him to within one of matching Federer’s record of 20. “I just focus on trying to be 100% ready for it,” said Nadal, who will be contesting his 27th Grand Slam final. “When I arrived here, my goal was to produce a chance to compete for the big thing again. Here I am. “I give myself another chance, as I did in Wimbledon, as I did in Australia, as I did in Roland Garros. “You win, you lose. That’s part of all the sport. “I would love to be the one who achieve more Grand Slams, but I still sleep very well without being the one who have more Grand Slams.” In Medvedev, who will be appearing in his fourth consecutive final, Nadal will face the hottest player in the men’s game and perhaps one of the most complex. The 23-year-old Russian, who admits to sometimes being unable to control his inner-demons when on court, has embraced the role of U.S. Open villain, smashing racquets and giving the crowd the middle finger. But in a Jekyll and Hyde type switch Medvedev on Saturday turned into a soft-spoken apologist. “I will not say that I’m a kind person or a good person, I can only say I’m a really calm person in life,” said Medvedev, who has picked up $19,000 in fines for his antics. “I actually have no idea why the demons go out when I play tennis. “I’m not proud of what I did. I’m working to never do it again.” As unpredictable as Medvedev can be, Nadal is a man of routine from the exact placing of water bottles to a twitchy pre-serve ritual. Opponents and fans both know what they will get from the Spaniard each and every time he steps on court - relentless effort and refusal to surrender. Medvedev will certainly be needing a better effort than the one he showed at the Rogers Cup final in Montreal in August when the Spaniard swept past him 6-3 6-0. “Talking about Rafa, it’s tough to find words,” said Medvedev. “He’s one of the greatest champions in the history of our sport. He’s just a machine, a beast on the court.” The same could be said about Williams who has shown devastating form in getting to her 10th U.S. Open final. Before Nadal and Medvedev take centre stage on Sunday the women will have their day on Saturday with 37-year-old Williams needing a win over 19-year-old sensation Andreescu to snatch a record equalling 24th career Grand Slam singles title.

{"title": "Women at the frontline: Investing in gender-responsive climate action for Bangladesh", "body": "When Cyclone Amphan struck Bangladesh's south-western coast in May 2020, it destroyed more than 55,000 homes in Satkhira and Khulna. Nearly half a million people were left homeless — most of them women and children. They gathered along flooded embankments in search of relief. Many walked long distances for safe drinking water, cared for the sick in overcrowded shelters, and lost their only sources of income as shrimp ponds and fields filled with saline water. For women in coastal Bangladesh, climate change is not a distant threat but an everyday struggle. Bangladesh now faces a triple challenge. The combined effects of climate change, persistent gender inequality, and underinvestment are hampering progress in health, education, and women's empowerment. The Climate Change and Gender Action Plan (ccGAP), developed by the government and UN Women, is one of the key frameworks to address these issues. Its latest phase calls for climate resilience and development strategies centred on women's needs, voices, and experiences. The impacts of climate change on women are severe. Research since the 2000s shows that rising salinity in coastal water has increased pregnancy complications. Rural women spend hours collecting water and firewood, a burden made worse by erratic weather and water scarcity. These long journeys, often alone, also heighten their exposure to harassment and gender-based violence. During floods and cyclones, girls drop out of school at higher rates and many are forced into early marriage. UNICEF found that after Cyclone Amphan, around 25% of girls in severely affected areas left school, and child marriage rates rose as families lost livelihoods. Bangladesh still records one of the world's highest rates of gender-based violence — over 70% of ever-partnered women have experienced intimate partner abuse, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The situation is often worse in climate-vulnerable districts, where displacement and insecurity leave women more exposed. Although women have long been at the forefront of community resilience, their livelihoods remain fragile. More than 96% of employed women work in the informal sector, without job security or social protection. As salinity and erratic weather reduce crop yields, many rural women migrate to cities in search of work — often ending up in brickfields or domestic service under exploitative conditions. Female-headed households spend a greater share of their income on climate adaptation than male-headed ones, yet they have less access to credit, training, or land ownership. Their voices are still underrepresented in disaster management committees, water governance, and budget planning. Even when women are included, participation is often symbolic rather than substantive. Bangladesh has, however, made progress in gender budgeting. The gender budget now covers all 62 ministries and divisions, with Tk 260,766.6 crore — nearly one-third of the national budget — allocated to gender-related programmes in the current fiscal year. Through the Gender Financial Tracking Model, linked to the iBAS++ system, the government can monitor gender-related spending across ministries in real time. Yet recent trends show concerning reversals. This fiscal year, the share of gender-relevant allocation in the total budget fell to 33.01%, down from 34.11% last year. The overall gender budget declined by almost 9% compared to the previous year's revised allocation. Climate-focused social safety net allocations also dropped sharply — to just 6%, from 17% in the previous fiscal year's revised budget. The \"Enhancing Adaptive Capacity for Coastal Communities\" programme, vital for coastal women, saw a 46.8% cut. Similarly, initiatives supporting skills and enterprise development, such as ProGRESS, were reduced by more than 40%, while maternal and neonatal health programmes fell by 29%. Even grassroots women's entrepreneurship programmes faced a 25% funding reduction. Not all trends are negative. Some safety net programmes saw significant boosts — allocations for the Mother and Child Benefit Programme rose by almost 14%, and support for widows and deserted women increased by more than 23%. The Implementation of Mother and Child Benefit Support Programme received a remarkable 59% rise in funding. While these are welcome gains, they do little to offset the overall decline, and there is no guarantee that the most vulnerable women will actually benefit. Beyond budget figures, a deeper problem persists — data gaps and limited transparency in measuring impact. In recent gender budget reports, only a fraction of ministries provided clear evidence of how their spending benefits women. For FY2025–26, only 16 out of 62 ministries submitted detailed gender budgets, an improvement of just six from the previous year. Without robust, evidence-based monitoring, claims of positive outcomes remain unverified — undermining the credibility of the entire gender budgeting agenda. Evidence from global institutions underscores the economic case for action. The World Resources Institute estimates that every dollar invested in climate adaptation generates returns of two to ten dollars. The World Bank finds that increasing women's participation in the workforce could boost Bangladesh's GDP by up to 40%. Integrating gender at every stage of climate budgeting is therefore not only ethical but economically sound. This integration should go beyond health and education, extending to infrastructure, water management, and disaster planning — with real-time tracking of who benefits from each project. More investment is needed in safe water, sanitation, mobile health clinics, and women's health networks, particularly in disaster-prone areas. The ccGAP also calls for easier access to finance for women entrepreneurs through revolving funds and affordable loans. True progress will require meaningful participation by women in decision-making, alongside collaboration between government, civil society, and the private sector. Bangladesh can draw lessons from global models such as Sweden's Climate Investment Fund, Costa Rica's Payment for Ecosystem Services, and Kenya's Green Belt Movement. These examples demonstrate how inclusive, gender-responsive investments can transform vulnerability into resilience. Climate change, gender inequality, and investment shortfalls are not isolated issues — they are interconnected national challenges. The future depends on recognising this link and acting decisively. The time for half-measures is over. Bangladesh must ensure that women's knowledge, labour, and leadership are placed at the heart of every climate solution.

{"title": "ICC to ask Bangladesh to play in India, with venues to be changed: Indian media", "body": "Although the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has applied to move World Cup matches out of India, the chances of that request being implemented appear very slim. According to Indian media, the ICC is set to propose that Bangladesh play at two alternative venues within India, rather than in Sri Lanka. Citing security concerns for Bangladeshi nationals in India, the BCB had written twice to the ICC requesting that the upcoming T20 World Cup matches be shifted to Sri Lanka. However, the world cricket governing body believes that relocating venues from one country to another at the very last moment before the tournament begins would be logistically difficult. As an alternative, the ICC is considering hosting Bangladesh's matches in Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram. BCB president Aminul Islam has already made his stance clear, saying that alternative venues in India still mean playing in India. Under the current schedule, the group stage of the 10th T20 World Cup, set to begin on 7 February, will see Bangladesh play all four of their matches in India—three in Kolkata and the final one in Mumbai. Indian cricket portal Cricbuzz reported that while the BCB remains firm on playing in Sri Lanka, the ICC is exploring alternative venues within India. It is understood that the ICC and T20 World Cup co-host BCCI have already been in contact with the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA). NDTV has reported similar information. Yesterday, a meeting took place in Vadodara, Gujarat, between ICC chairman Jay Shah and BCCI officials. However, no media outlet has confirmed whether the decision to propose alternative venues was taken at that meeting. NDTV's report outlined the ICC's possible reasoning for suggesting other Indian venues. On Sunday, during the first ODI of the India–New Zealand series in Gujarat, Bangladeshi umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid Saikat officiated the match. The report suggested that, in response to the BCB's security concerns, the ICC may cite Saikat's example and advise Bangladesh to play their T20 World Cup matches in India. The BCB's security concerns in India stem from the incident on 3 January, when Mustafizur Rahman was withdrawn from the IPL following threats from extremists. Bangladesh questioned how the entire national team, along with journalists, sponsors and spectators travelling for the World Cup, could be kept safe if even one player's security could not be ensured, and therefore requested that matches be moved out of India. According to Cricbuzz, due to logistical challenges ahead of the World Cup starting in the first week of February, the likelihood of the ICC accepting Bangladesh's request appears very low. The ICC may communicate its decision to Bangladesh today, Monday. However, if the ICC proposes or decides on a venue change within India, the BCB is unlikely to accept it. Speaking in Sylhet last Saturday amid rumours of a move to Chennai, BCB president Aminul Islam said: \"Another venue in India is still India. As you know, we are not taking this World Cup decision alone. We will consult the government, and we are still where we were before.\" BCB / bcci / 2026 T-20 World Cup / Bangladesh Cricket Team", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/icc-ask-bangladesh-play-india-venues-be-changed-indian-media-reports-1332126", "date": "2026-01-12T12:00:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 12 January, 2026, 12:00 pm Last modified: 12 January, 2026, 12:40 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 523, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:32:39.795457"}

The decision was announced through an office order today (31 January), signed by the chief personnel officer of the CPA. According to the order, the employees were transferred \"in the interest of service and to ensure smooth port operations\" after allegations of involvement in activities that obstructed official duties. Ctg Port paralysed by strike over NCT deal as workers defy warnings The transferred officials are Mohammad Humayun Kabir, audit assistant of the Internal Audit and Inspection Department; Mohammad Ibrahim Hossain, first-grade engine driver of the Marine Department; Mohammad Anowarul Azim, senior accounts assistant of the Accounts and Finance Department; and Mohammad Faridur Rahman, SS Khalasi of the Mechanical Department, who was also attached to Chattogram Port Girls' High School.

However, defying the warnings workers and employees enforced daylong work abstention and staged protest in front of port gates effectively paralysing the port operations today, protesting authorities decision to lease NCT to Dubai based operator DP World in an unsolicited deal. The workers have also announced to observe a similar type of protest tomorrow. They also warned tougher programmes if the authority does not refrain from the NCT deal.

{"title": "Lower the treasury rates for a vibrant bond market: Arif Khan", "body": "Interest rates on government securities should be lowered so a vibrant bond market can be built in the country, said Arif Khan, a former commissioner of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission. Khan, who is managing director and chief executive officer of the IDLC Finance, was speaking at a virtual press meet by the Bangladesh Leasing and Finance Companies Association (BLFCA) on Tuesday. He discussed the problems that are not allowing financial institutions to accumulate long-term stable funds through bonds. The government is the most reliable borrower and debt securities issued by the government offer the lowest interest. Rates in government securities like treasury bonds and bills are used as the benchmarks for interest in financial markets all over the world, he added. In Bangladesh, treasury bonds with three- to five-year maturity are still offering 7.5 percent interest followed by some 100 basis points decline in recent days. In neighbouring India, the rate is around four percent. Now, if a private sector issuer, like a lender, offers bonds to investors, they demand an added interest and the issuer needs to pay at least eight to nine percent for mid-term bonds, while for long-term bonds, the cost of funds also reaches double-digit figures. The stable funding costs far more than funds collected from deposits, said Khan, who is also a former president of the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Bangladesh. Hence, in reality the interest rate is yet to be a win-win for both issuers and investors. The lack of an investor class with appetite for bonds is also a problem for the Bangladesh market, believes the former president of CFA Society Bangladesh. Across the world, including in India, institutional funds are the main investors in bonds. They have fixed-income mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance funds to flood the markets with money for bond issuers. Bangladesh should immediately start fixed-income mutual fund as that is the easiest among others, said Khan. He also pointed out some issues that make bond issuance a tough job for corporations. In Bangladesh, bond issuers need approval from the securities regulator, and also from the central bank, if the issuer is a bank or a financial institution. Both the regulators take time to check issues within the issuer, and also approve the interest rate. Even in India regulators do not ask for approval anymore, nor do they fix the interest rate, which is a result of issuer-investor negotiation. He mentioned an example where investors had agreed to subscribe to two-thirds of a corporate bond but later turned away only because of a delay in regulatory approval. \"The Indian regulator has now said to issuers, you do not have to take approval, rather comply with the criteria set in regulation and just keep us informed of the updates,\" said Arif Khan, the CEO of the largest non-bank financial institution of the country. The secondary market for bonds would offer yield curves and also liquidity that attracts investors. The cost of bond issuance, listing and trading in exchanges should be lowered, he added. Very importantly, corporate governance within issuer firms is a must for a healthy bond market that can solve a lot of structural problems in Bangladesh's financial system, said Khan. He is hopeful seeing the securities regulator's initiatives to build a vibrant bond market. The government was about to repeal tax incentives for zero coupon bond investors during this budget, and the BSEC chairman's effort restored it. Fiscal incentives are important to popularise the new types of securities on the markets, Arif Khan said. bond market / Arif Khan / treasury rates", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/lower-treasury-rates-vibrant-bond-market-arif-khan-106282", "date": "2020-07-14T21:50:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 14 July, 2020, 09:50 pm Last modified: 15 July, 2020, 10:08 am", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 599, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:32:44.115254"}
{"title": "Mustafiz's inclusion could increase Bangladesh team's security risk: ICC", "body": "Further uncertainty has emerged over Bangladesh's participation in the T20 World Cup. Citing potential security risks Bangladesh could face if the tournament is held in India, the ICC's security department has recently sent a letter to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), which has added to the doubts. Speaking at a press conference at the BFF Bhaban today, Youth and Sports Adviser Professor Asif Nazrul said the ICC's security letter mentioned three reasons why Bangladesh's security concerns could increase during the upcoming T20 World Cup in India. One of those reasons, he said, was the inclusion of left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman in the World Cup squad. According to the adviser, the letter stated that having Mustafizur in the team would heighten security risks. The adviser explained that the ICC security team had highlighted three specific issues in its letter that could increase security threats to the Bangladesh team in India. \"The letter says that Bangladesh's security concerns will increase if three things happen. First, if Mustafizur Rahman is included in the Bangladesh team. Second, if Bangladeshi supporters move around wearing the national jersey. And third, the closer Bangladesh's national election gets, the greater the security risk to the team,\" he said. Terming the ICC's stance \"bizarre\" and \"unjustified\", the adviser added, \"If the ICC expects us to build a team by leaving out our best bowler, stop supporters from wearing the national jersey, and delay an election just to play cricket, then there cannot be a more unrealistic expectation than this.\" Strongly criticising the current political and social situation in India, Asif Nazrul said, \"Given the aggressive communal atmosphere and the anti-Bangladesh environment prevailing in India right now—especially in the context of a sustained campaign over the last 16 months—it has become impossible to play cricket there. The Mustafizur issue and this ICC letter have proven that beyond any doubt.\" At the press conference, the adviser made it clear that the ICC should not be run under the influence of any single country. \"No one should have a monopoly over cricket. If the ICC is truly a global organisation and does not operate at India's behest, then Bangladesh must be given the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka. On this issue, we will not make any concessions,\" he said. He also added, \"I saw in the newspapers—I don't know whether it is true or not—that Pakistan has offered to host our tournaments. There is no problem with hosting in Pakistan, and there is no problem with hosting in the United Arab Emirates either.\" In conclusion, the adviser said, \"When there is no proper playing environment for one of our players, and when the national cricket board of India—a national authority—bows to these aggressive communal forces and says that he should not be allowed to play there, what greater proof does the ICC need? This clearly proves beyond any doubt that there is no playing environment for us there. There is no environment to play anywhere in India.\" BCB / icc / Mustafizur Rahman / 2026 T-20 World Cup / Bangladesh Cricket Team", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/icc-says-mustafizs-inclusion-could-increase-bangladesh-teams-security-risk-1332471", "date": "2026-01-12T16:55:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 12 January, 2026, 04:55 pm Last modified: 12 January, 2026, 05:36 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 511, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:32:46.318009"}
{"title": "Xiaomi Pad Mini: Big impressions in a small body", "body": "In the last few years, tablets have been growing larger and heavier with words like \"Pro\", \"Max\" and \"Ultra\" in their names. Xiaomi's new Pad Mini feels refreshingly compact in such a reality. The 8.8-inch device arrives as a worthy Android alternative to Apple's iPad mini, offering a balance of portability, power and price that few can match. Unveiled alongside the Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro smartphones, the Pad Mini has quickly drawn attention for its sleek design and solid performance. The aluminium body feels sturdy yet lightweight at 326 grams, making it comfortable to hold for long periods. Subtle bevels along the flat edges add to its ease of use, while the minimalist finish maintains Xiaomi's signature understated style. According to Android Central, the display is one of the Pad Mini's strongest features. Its 8.8-inch IPS LCD panel offers a 3K resolution and a smooth 165Hz refresh rate, which ensures crisp visuals and fluid scrolling. Colours appear vibrant and well-balanced, ideal for watching videos or reading e-books. Xiaomi's built-in reading mode, which can turn the screen monochrome, adds extra appeal for those who spend hours reading. Powering the tablet is MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ processor, the same chip used in Xiaomi's flagship 15T Pro. This gives the Pad Mini remarkable speed for its size. Whether streaming, browsing, or gaming, it runs effortlessly. A 7,500mAh battery supports more than 10 hours of screen time, and the inclusion of a 67W charger ensures quick refuelling. Small but versatile, the Pad Mini even includes two USB-C ports for added convenience. Paired with Xiaomi's Focus Pen and the sturdy Pad Mini Cover, it becomes both a creative tool and a functional smart home hub.

{"title": "Five must-have apps for students", "body": "It is no secret that student life is often hectic. Between lectures, deadlines, part-time jobs, and social commitments, many young people feel overwhelmed by the pressure to keep everything on track. But in today's world, help is just a tap away. The right apps can simplify life, sharpen focus, and help students make the most of their time. There are thousands of options available, and it can be difficult to know which ones are truly worth your storage space. Some promise productivity, others organisation, and many do a bit of both. This article highlights five outstanding apps that many students have found useful – apps that are practical, easy to use, and genuinely helpful for surviving and thriving at school, college, or university. NotebookLM – AI-powered clarity NotebookLM by Google is an assistant for students buried under readings. Unlike general chatbots, it works only with the files you upload, offering focused answers grounded only in your materials. Upload a paper or textbook chapter, and it becomes a sharp study partner – summarising key ideas, answering questions, and even generating study guides with quiz questions and glossaries. The interface is clean and intuitive. You can organise notebooks by course, and store up to 50 documents in one project. One standout feature is audio overviews – podcast-style summaries of your documents, available in English and Bangla. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel It is not perfect – nuanced arguments can sometimes get flattened – but for essays, exams, or dense theory classes, NotebookLM reduces friction. Free and surprisingly capable, it is the rare AI tool that actually saves time and strengthens understanding. Notion – the digital brain for organised minds Although mostly known as a note-taking app, Notion is more than that. It is a workspace that allows you to write, plan, manage tasks, and organise your studies – all in one place. Whether you want to take class notes, track deadlines, or build a study timetable, Notion helps keep everything together. One of the app's greatest strengths is its flexibility. You can create custom templates for assignments, keep a reading list, or even build a personal knowledge base for revision. It also supports collaborative work, which is useful for group projects. The interface takes a little time to get used to, but once you do, it becomes an essential tool in your academic life. Forest – grow trees, not distractions For students who struggle to stay away from their phones while studying, Forest offers a clever solution. The app encourages you to put your phone down by planting a virtual tree that grows while you work. If you leave the app before the time is up, the tree dies. This simple yet powerful concept helps many students stay focused for longer periods. Forest also allows you to track your focus habits over time, which can be motivating. For those who care about the environment, the app also partners with tree-planting organisations to plant real trees based on user activity. Staying focused has never felt this rewarding. Microsoft Lens – turn paper into digital notes Students often come across whiteboards, printed handouts, or textbooks that they want to keep for later. Microsoft Lens makes it easy. This app turns your phone into a smart scanner. You can take a photo of a document, and the app automatically crops, enhances, and saves it as a PDF, Word file, or image. What makes Microsoft Lens stand out is its accuracy and simplicity. It is especially useful for students who want to keep tidy digital copies of handwritten notes, lecture slides, or pages from borrowed books. The scanned files can be saved to OneDrive, shared via email, or inserted directly into documents. It is a quiet game-changer for organised students. Anki – smarter revision through spaced repetition If you have ever crammed for an exam only to forget everything a week later, you are not alone. Anki uses a study technique called spaced repetition to help you remember information for the long term. You create digital flashcards, and the app tests you just before you are likely to forget the content. This method has been shown to work well for memorising facts, definitions, foreign vocabulary, and formulas. Medical and language students in particular swear by Anki. While the design is not flashy, its effectiveness is hard to ignore. You can also download card decks shared by others, which saves time. In the end, no app can do your studying for you, but the right tools can make a big difference in how you manage your time, retain information, and stay motivated. These five apps have been chosen not because they are trendy, but because they genuinely help students deal with the challenges of academic life. Technology should support learning – not distract from it. Whether you are a higher secondary student or studying at university, these apps offer a thoughtful balance between discipline and care. After all, successful studying is not just about working harder – it is about working smarter, with tools that understand your needs.

The law minister was speaking as the chief guest at the inaugural function of the online training programme for lawyers on 'Skills Development in a Virtual Court System'. The Ministry of Law has organised this training program as most of the lawyers do not have the right idea regarding technical and information technology about the virtual court system. The Minister said that all offices around the world and in the country are moving towards digitalisation. If the judiciary does not move towards the virtual world, it will lag behind not only in the world but also in the country. \"We will face criticism and people will fail in placing their trust in us. Taking everything into consideration, the government has organised training on virtual courts,\" added the Law Minister.

{"title": "United stay fifth after Saints grab last-gasp leveller", "body": "Manchester United's Champions League qualification hopes suffered a blow after an equaliser deep in stoppage time from Michael Obafemi earned Southampton a 2-2 draw in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Monday. United, unbeaten in 18 games in all competitions, were poised to move up to third after Anthony Martial's 23rd-minute strike had put them 2-1 ahead. They had fallen behind to an early Stuart Armstrong goal before Marcus Rashford equalised. But on the day that second-placed Manchester City's two-year ban from European football was overturned on appeal, meaning only the top four will qualify for the Champions League as usual, United's late lapse left them fifth on 59 points. Leicester City are fourth, ahead of United on goal difference, with Chelsea third on 60 points. City and title winners Liverpool have already secured Champions League places for next season. Southampton took a shock lead in the 12th minute when Paul Pogba was robbed by Danny Ings just outside the area and Nathan Redmond's cross found Armstrong at the back post where the Scottish midfielder slotted home. Rashford then had the ball in the net, converting a low cross from Luke Shaw, but it was ruled out for offside although the United striker did not have to wait long to level. Pogba played the ball in to Martial who held off two Saints defenders before poking the ball to Rashford and the striker made no mistake with a left-foot finish in the 20th minute. Three minutes later United had the lead, Bruno Fernandes fed Martial on the left and the French international cut inside and smashed the ball home. However, the home side never got a real grip on the game in midfield against a Southampton side that moved the ball well and constantly pressed. United had to finish the game with 10 men after Brandon Williams went off injured, with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having no substitute opportunities, and they failed to hold on to the three points when Obafemi turned in a poorly defended corner at the back post. James Ward-Prowse's in-swinger was flicked on by Jan Bednarek and Obafemi got in front of Victor Lindelof to find the decisive touch. \"The second half was a bit of a slog, we were not good enough on the ball. We brought pressure on to ourselves but we felt we did enough to win the game,\" said United captain Harry Maguire. \"We have improved on defending set plays. We had a terrible record at the start of the season but have been really good on them. Can't get let him get a header in when we have four men around the goal so have to look at it. \"We are disappointed a the moment but we dust ourselves down tomorrow,\" he added. manchester united / Premier League", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sports/united-stay-fifth-after-saints-grab-last-gasp-leveller-106105", "date": "2020-07-14T15:50:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 14 July, 2020, 03:50 pm Last modified: 14 July, 2020, 03:59 pm", "category": "sports", "language": "en", "token_count": 468, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:33:01.378737"}

{"title": "Hold awareness campaigns on facilities for people with disabilities at polling centres: DRW, TIB", "body": "Disability Rights Watch (DRW) and Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) have urged the government and the Election Commission to run effective publicity campaigns on measures to ensure the voting rights of persons with disabilities ahead of the 13th National Parliamentary Election. Speakers at a press conference held at TIB's auditorium today (5 February) said that although decisions have been taken to allow persons with disabilities to use their own vehicles on polling day, allow visually impaired voters to cast ballots with the assistance of guides, and set up special booths on the ground floor for physically challenged voters, a lack of adequate publicity has left many disabled voters unaware of these facilities. TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said, \"The concept of a 'level playing field' in elections should not be limited to candidates alone but must also be ensured equally for voters. \"Ensuring an environment where persons with disabilities and marginalised voters can cast their votes according to their abilities is a moral and professional responsibility of the Election Commission, the administration, and the army,\" he added. He noted that while some countries have provisions for collecting votes from persons with disabilities at their homes, ensuring a safe and barrier-free environment for them is an urgent necessity in Bangladesh. He also cautioned that election manifestos should not remain mere paper documents or symbolic slogans. Recalling the active participation of persons with disabilities in the anti-discrimination movement, he said expectations from the new government include building an inclusive, discrimination-free, and accountable system of governance. He urged all political parties to take initiatives to protect the rights of persons with disabilities and called on the new government to formulate a specialised action plan for them. Describing the lack of accessibility in government buildings as a violation of fundamental rights, he symbolically suggested keeping lifts closed for a week so that officials could better understand the hardships faced by persons with disabilities. DRW Member Secretary Khandaker Zahurul Alam said, \"The Election Commission had assured us that there would be ground-floor booths for voters with disabilities, access with wheelchairs, and arrangements for interpreters. However, we do not see any visible campaign by the government regarding the implementation of these decisions.\" Speakers at the press conference said that due to a lack of information and publicity, concerns persist among persons with disabilities about whether they will be able to cast their votes smoothly at polling centres. Md Abdullah, a speech- and hearing-impaired youth worker, said, \"For persons with disabilities like us, the presence of assistants and interpreters makes it much easier to exercise our voting rights. But many lose interest in voting simply because they are unaware of these arrangements.\" The speakers also demanded the introduction of postal ballots for persons with disabilities in future local government and other elections, saying voting rights for persons with disabilities cannot be ensured without inclusive management of the electoral process. Country Director of Sightsavers Bangladesh Amrita Rejina Rozario said, \"A supportive environment must be ensured so that registered voters with disabilities can cast their votes without obstacles. \"Not only during elections, but also afterwards, there should be space in parliament to raise issues related to the rights of persons with disabilities,\" she added. The speakers further stressed the need for extensive publicity through the media, social media, local administration, and field-level officials regarding the facilities adopted by the Election Commission, saying this would increase confidence among voters with disabilities and boost their participation in the voting process. DRW President Mansur Ahmed Chowdhury said the assurances given regarding persons with disabilities must be implemented, noting that there has been no visible progress so far. \"The number of persons with disabilities is increasing, and surveys show around 15% of the country's population lives with disabilities,\" he added.

{"title": "Russia battles wildfires amid record warm weather", "body": "Wildfires raging in Siberia in record summer temperatures have decreased considerably over the past week, Russia's forest service said Saturday, as it battles blazes by cloud seeding and explosives. Freakishly warm weather across large swathes of Siberia since January, combined with low soil moisture, have contributed to a resurgence of wildfires that devastated the region last summer, the European Union's climate monitoring network said this week. Both the number and intensity of fires in Siberia and parts of Alaska have increased since mid-June, resulting in the highest carbon emissions for the month — 59 million tonnes of CO2 — since records began in 2003, it said. Russia's Aerial Forest Protection Service said it was trying to suppress 136 fires over 43,000 hectares (430 square kilometres) as of Saturday. Firefighters are using explosives to contain the fires and using cloud seeding with silver iodide to encourage rain, it said. However most of the fires have been deemed too remote and expensive to handle, with over 333,000 hectares currently ablaze in areas where all firefighting efforts have stopped, it said. This is considerably smaller than a week ago, when the service reported fires over a total of two million hectares. From mid-June, regions in Russia's far north, including beyond the Arctic circle, have registered unprecedented heat records. Russia's weather service expert Roman Vilfand had said anti-cyclones — which create abnormally clear skies with no clouds or rain — had increased in the northern hemisphere. In the Arctic, where the sun doesn't set in the summer, this means that sunlight is heating the Earth's surface around the clock, increasing risk of fires, he said. Fresh satellite images showed Saturday that the largest fires are still in Russia's vast Yakutia region, which is sparsely populated and borders the Arctic Ocean. The region announced a state of emergency on July 2 due to the wildfires, which the governor of Yakutia said were caused by \"dry thunderstorms.\" Greenpeace Russia's forest programme, which analyses satellite data, said Saturday that a total of 9.26 million hectares — greater than the size of Portugal — have been impacted by wildfires since the beginning of 2020. The organisation blames Russia's wildfire crisis on lack of funding of the forest service which now cannot ensure adequate fire prevention.

No airlines can bring passengers from Covid-19-hit country due to the risk of further Covid-19 spread. Passengers who came from Bangladesh cannot be brought on transit flights either. According to media report, foreign airlines already sent letters to travel agencies after getting the directives. \"Upon request of the Italian Health Ministry, all flights/passengers from Bangladesh with final destination to Italy are forbidden,\" read a Qatar Airways letter sent to one of their business partners.

{"title": "Extra chlorine to kill coronavirus in Ctg Wasa water raises health worries", "body": "The Chattogram Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) has almost doubled the use of chlorine in water since the last week of May to contain the spread of Covid-19. Currently, it is adding 0.5-1.0 milligrams of chlorine per litre of water, while it previously used 0.2 to 0.8 milligrams. Experts said the use of excessive amounts of chlorine could pose a health risk to people. They said drinking water with excessive amounts of chlorine, for a long time, could cause: breathing problems, congenital disabilities, colon cancer, bladder cancer, etc. According to the experts, adding an excessive amount of chlorine to water, without proper research is not appropriate. Maqsud Alam, chief engineer of Chattogram Wasa, admitted that extra chlorine is being added to the water. He said, \"The step has been taken to maintain the chlorine level at 0.2 milligrams for per litre of water at the customers' end.\" \"It does not matter how much chlorine we are adding at the plant, because chlorine is a volatile substance. It also melts in the air from the water while it runs through the pipes,\" said Maqsud Alam. \"The Covid-19 guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) permit the use of 0.5-milligrams of chlorine per litre of water. We have started to add more chlorine to the water treatment plants and reservoirs according to that guideline,\" he added. Recently, a research article published by the British weekly scientific journal Nature revealed that the novel coronavirus can spread through water. Quoting the study, carried out by Netherlands' KWR Watercycle Research Institute on samples collected from areas in Sweden, Netherlands and the USA, the article also stated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive in unclean or used water. Water – after being used in toilets or for washing one's hands and face – could allow the deadly virus to infect other people, the research said. Officials of Chattogram Wasa became alert after several reports surfaced of the novel coronavirus spreading via water in some European countries. The organisation delivers more than 35 crore litres of water through a 6,000-kilometre pipeline in the city. The officials fear that the pipeline could be a medium of spreading Covid-19. That is why they started adding extra chlorine to disinfect the water. According to Chattogram Wasa sources, it used to add 0.2-0.8 milligram chlorine per litre of water. However, this amount of chlorine did not reach the remote areas of the city like: Patenga, Halishahar, Pahartali, and Baklia. As a result, water in these areas contained different bacteria. After the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, Chattogram Wasa aimed to ensure there was 0.15-0.2 milligrams of chlorine per litre of water in these areas. For this, they are ensuring 0.8-1.0 milligrams of chlorine per litre of water at the water treatment plants and reservoirs. According to the Environment Conservation Rules 1997, 0.2 milligrams of chlorine is acceptable per litre of water. Any amount above this is harmful to human health. Speaking to The Business Standard, Dr Chowdhury Md Monirul Hasan, professor of the Department of Biochemistry under Chattogram University, said, \"I did not stumble across any information saying that the novel coronavirus can spread through water. All germs need carriers to spread.\" \"Germs that spread through coughs and sneezes will not spread through water. Besides, the pH level of the water prevents harmful germs from spreading. Meanwhile, Wasa should not have increased the use of chlorine in the water without prior studies,\" he added. He added that the extra chlorine will have negative long-term effects on the human body. Reiterating the opinion, Dr Asiful Hoque, chairman of the Water Resources Department of Chattogram Engineering and Technology University, said, \"Higher levels of chlorine in water causes long term effects on the body. It can cause different skin diseases and cancer.\" Chattogram Wasa collects 82 percent of its water from the Karnaphuli and Halda Rivers and 18 percent from deep tube wells. There are 73,000 residential and commercial users in the city. Milon Kumar Chakraborti, former chemist of Chattogram Wasa, said, \"Wasa generally adds chlorine in three steps. In the first step, it adds chlorine to the water while collecting it from the rivers. \"Later, it adds chlorine in the tank – after the water purification process and before running the water through the pipeline. In the third step, chlorine is added when the water reaches the Kalurghat booster, plus Batali Hill, Nasirabad, and Patenga reservoirs.\" Ctg Wasa / chlorine / health worries", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/health/extra-chlorine-kill-coronavirus-ctg-wasa-water-raises-health-worries-102265", "date": "2020-07-05T22:55:00+06:00", "author": "Abu Sayem 05 July, 2020, 10:55 pm Last modified: 06 July, 2020, 12:48 pm", "category": "bangladesh", "language": "en", "token_count": 741, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:33:52.476953"}
{"title": "96% of Covid-19 patients recover in Beacon pharma’s Favipira trial", "body": "Favipira double-blind trial A clinical trial of Beacon Pharmaceuticals' Favipira tablet, to treat Covid-19 patients, has yielded a 96 percent success rate. Associate Professor of the medicine department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital Syed Ghulam Mogni Mowla announced the trial results at a seminar at the Westin Hotel in the capital on Wednesday. Beacon Pharmaceutical arranged the seminar, while the Bangladesh Society of Medicine ran the trial. Favipiravir is the generic name of Favipira, which is known as Avigan in Japan. Beacon pharma brought it to Bangladesh in April. Favipira was trialled among 50 patients in four hospitals in Dhaka: the Kuwait Bangladesh Friendship Government Hospital, Dhaka Mahanagar General Hospital, Kurmitola General Hospital, and Mugda Medical College and Hospital. Syed Ghulam said 48 percent of patients recovered or tested negative for the virus four days after taking Favipira, and 96 percent did so after 10 days. For the placebo group, this rate was zero percent after four days, and 52 percent after 10 days. Those taking Favipira showed an improvement in their lungs three times higher than those in the placebo group. However, patients with complex conditions or pregnant women were not given the tablet. The medication did not result in any side effects to the patients' livers, kidneys or carbohydrates in the blood. Moreover, neither the experimental group nor the placebo group suffered any significant side effects. Speakers at the seminar said those who did not test positive for Covid-19 or do not have symptoms should not take Favipira. Only those who are reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive should take it. Real time RT-PCR is one of the most widely-used laboratory methods for detecting the novel coronavirus. Each Favipira tablet costs Tk400. Patients have to complete a course of seven to 10 days based on doctors' advice and the stage of the disease. Professor Dr ABM Abdullah, personal physician of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and former dean of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University's medicine department, told the seminar the trial of the tablet among 50 patients could not be described as final at this moment. He said the trial should be run among several thousand other patients – including those in hospitals outside Dhaka. However, Favipira can be used now in early stages as no medicine has yet been invented to treat novel coronavirus patients, Abdullah said. \"Asymptomatic patients routinely testing positive, however, should not be given this tablet,\" added the physician. Professor Dr Syed Modasser Ali, chairman of Bangladesh Medical Research Council, said patients have to take Favipira as per doctors' advice as there is no specific drug at this moment to treat them. However, they should not take it indiscriminately, he warned. \"This is not a preventive medicine. As long as there is no vaccine, there will be no preventive medication,\" said Modasser. He said it would take another two years for the vaccine to be available and people should follow health guidelines until then. Favipira was clinically trialled in Bangladesh to know if it was effective and safe. The double-blind trial, named Dhaka Trial, was carried out as per rules of the drug directorate and Bangladesh Medical Research Council.

Levi made the announcement on July 2 and Gap followed suit eight days later. Gap Inc, which owns brands including Old Navy, Gap, Athleta, and Banana Republic, said in a statement on Friday that it would work with vendors to compensate them – in full – for finished goods and goods in production that were cancelled or subject to pack and hold. The clothing retailer has extended payment terms on certain orders, but in the immediate term, it is providing low-cost financing to vendor partners, the statement added. Bangladeshi apparel suppliers expressed their gratitude to both retailers for acting as good business partners during the pandemic. \"Two US retailers announcing to take all goods sends a positive message; it will restore hope among suppliers,\" said Abdus Salam Murshedy, president of the Exporters Association of Bangladesh and former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). \"Many suppliers have been in business with these retailers for long, so we expect responsible behaviour from them,\" said Murshedy, who is also the managing director of Envoy Textiles Ltd, a major denim fabric supplier of Levi Strauss. Gap Inc is also working with its banking partners to increase the amount of funds available within the programme as it moves forward, the statement reads. Salam Murshedy said in most cases where Gap Inc deferred payments, buyers were usually paid within 45 to 65 days of shipment. But it will now take more time. Seeking anonymity, a Gap supplier said, \"Finally, Gap sourcing head Christophe has informed all suppliers that the discounts earlier enforced on all shipments will be paid back in February 2021.\" BGMEA data shows the fashion retailer has cancelled orders worth about $21.53 million, affecting 30 factories. According to its factory list updated on March 2020, the company has business with 45 Bangladeshi garment factories. \"Gap is issuing a purchase order (PO) for all those cancelled orders as well and taking them gradually. It has rented a new warehouse for storing all the cancelled goods,\" the supplier added. The statement by Gap noted that the number of cancelled purchase orders is \"lower than 3 percent of purchase orders by value for finished garments and garments in production.\" The retailer also said it is working with vendors to explore liquidation opportunities for these finished garments. \"We are working with our vendors and suppliers to utilise uncut raw materials for future seasons,\" Gap Inc added. Levi Strauss wants to pay full US retailer Levi Strauss & Co wants to take full responsibility – and pay in full – for all finished, ready-to-ship orders and in-progress orders, reads a statement. Levi's has cancelled orders worth about $5.29 million with nine garment factories; its annual business turnover is about $300 million in Bangladesh, said industry insiders. The company also plans to use raw materials already received by suppliers for product orders in later seasons, the statement added. The retailer also extended its payment terms adding, which it believes \"are consistent with industry practice.\" \"We have not asked for discounts on payments. Our sourcing leads are staying in close conversation with suppliers and we are factoring their circumstances into our decisions.\" The US denim giant said it has had a programme with the International Finance Corporation since 2014 to provide suppliers with access to loans at favourable market rates. \"The majority of our products are made by suppliers with access to the programme and more will soon have access,\" Levi Strauss said in its statement. \"As our stores and wholesale partners open back up, we are starting to see demand come back and production turning back on. In addition, we have shared, and will continue to update, health and safety guidelines related to Covid-19 with suppliers that remain open or that will soon re-open, as government regulations permit,\" the company further said. The Levi Strauss Foundation had announced in early April that it was granting $1 million to address health, food and safety net needs apparel workers facing in sourcing communities, with a focus on women. The clothing company has recently announced that it plans to axe approximately 700 people from its corporate workforce, which represents about 15 percent of its global non-retail, non-manufacturing headcount.

{"title": "Holding tax for Bscic factories may drop to 5% in cities, 2% elsewhere", "body": "The government is set to significantly reduce the holding tax on factories located in the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (Bscic) industrial estates, aiming to ease business operations after Bscic's call for a full tax waiver. At present, city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads collect holding tax at varying rates. City corporations charge 23% on the assessed annual value of industrial and commercial properties, while municipalities levy 3-7%, and union parishads 1-7%. According to sources, the holding tax for factories in Bscic industrial estates may now be capped at a maximum of 5% within city corporation areas and 2% at the municipal and union parishad levels – a significant relief for small industries. Bscic Chairman Md Saiful Islam told The Business Standard on 6 January that Bscic had formally sought a full exemption for all industrial establishments in Bscic estates. \"We sent a letter to the Local Government Division requesting exemption from holding tax for industries in Bscic estates,\" he said. Following the proposal, the Local Government Division held meetings on 4 December last year with city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads. While a complete waiver was not approved, officials agreed to substantially cut the tax burden. However, the exact rates are yet to be finalised by the respective local government authorities. A senior Bscic official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many industrial units in Bscic estates have not been paying holding tax for years, leading to trade licence suspensions and operational difficulties. \"In many areas, factories cannot renew trade licences due to disputes over holding tax, disrupting business and discouraging investment,\" the official said. The official also noted that Section 24 of the Bscic Act 2023 allows for exemption of industrial units in Bscic estates from holding tax. He referenced the 2020 exemption of industrial units under Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (Beza) from local taxes and fees, which prompted investors to demand similar treatment. According to Bscic data, there are 83 industrial estates across the country – 12 within city corporation areas, 27 in municipal areas and 44 in union parishad areas. These estates contain 13,139 industrial plots, of which 11,513 have been allocated to 6,295 industrial enterprises, including 887 fully export-oriented units. Excluding land and buildings, total investment in these enterprises stands at Tk58,000 crore. In the 2024–25 fiscal year, factories in Bscic estates produced goods worth Tk65,352 crore, with exports accounting for Tk30,947 crore. During the same period, the enterprises paid Tk4,424 crore in taxes and VAT to the government. However, a senior official of the Local Government Division said holding tax and trade licence fees remain critical revenue sources for local authorities, who also maintain roads, street lighting, and waste management for industrial areas. \"While full exemption is not feasible, Bscic industries contribute substantially to employment, production, and exports. The decision is to reduce holding tax as much as possible,\" the official said. The impact of non-payment has already been felt in areas such as the tannery industrial zone under Tetuljhora Union Parishad in Hemayetpur, Savar, where trade licence renewals and new licences were blocked due to unpaid holding tax. The Local Government Division has now instructed all city corporations, municipalities, and union parishads that payment of holding tax will no longer affect the issuance or renewal of trade licences. Any application for a trade licence must be processed in accordance with the rules. Bscic Chairman Md Saiful Islam hoped that, with this, industries in Bscic estates should no longer face obstacles in obtaining trade licences.

The match, held at Al Awwal Park, saw Karim Benzema open the scoring for Ittihad. On a night when his former Real Madrid teammate found the net, Al Nassr star Cristiano Ronaldo failed to score. It was not a good outing for Sadio Mane or Joao Felix either. Al Ittihad were reduced to ten men in the 49th minute when Ahmed Al-Zulaydan was shown a red card, but Ronaldo and Félix failed to capitalise on the advantage. Ronaldo managed five shots, only one of which was on target. Al Nassr's lone goal came from Angelo Gabriel, while Benzema and Houssem Aouar scored for Ittihad. Ronaldo made his debut for Al Nassr in January 2023. That year, the club won the Arab Club Champions Cup, though it is not recognised as an official FIFA tournament. Since joining, the Portuguese legend has played in 13 official competitions for Al Nassr but has yet to win a single trophy. The club has reached three finals during his time — losing all of them. Al Nassr finished runners-up in the Saudi Pro League in both the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons, and third last season. ? ???: Cristiano Ronaldo has now 'lost' 13 out of 13 OFFICIAL TITLES since arriving at Al-Nassr:❌ Saudi League 2022/23.❌ Saudi League 2023/24.❌ Saudi League 2024/25.❌ King's Cup 2022/23.❌ King's Cup 2023/24.❌ King's Cup 2024/25.❌ King's Cup 2025/26.❌ Saudi… pic.twitter.com/tUC7EFBQNT— The Touchline | ?

{"title": "Banks asked to report on progress of fund creation for stock investment", "body": "The securities regulator has asked all listed banks to inform it about the progress on forming a special fund for investing in the ailing stock market. The Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) on June 30 sent a letter to the managing directors of banks, seeking progress reports within seven working days. The banks will have to report to the regulator the status of their investment in stocks from February 10 to June 28, 2020, according to the instruction. In the letter, the BSEC said the government and the Bangladesh Bank have taken significant initiatives to improve the liquidity position, as well as sustainable development of the capital market, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sources said 14 banks have already created a combined Tk1,650 crore fund for the purpose. The banks have taken approval from their boards but are yet to invest. Earlier on February 10, the Bangladesh Bank in a circular asked the banks to form a special fund of Tk200 crore each to invest in the capital market for the next five years. This amount will not be calculated with the regulatory limit of 25 percent of their capital. The decision was taken to increase liquidity supply in the stock market through banks' investment. The banks were also given exemption from maintaining provisioning against the investment. The initiative has opened up an opportunity to bring fresh investment of Tk12,000 crore from all 59 banks in the country. The investment opportunity will remain open until January 13, 2025. This move comes after the prime minister's instruction to take long and short-term measures to boost the stock market. As of December last year, banks' individual exposure to the stock market was 11 percent on average, far lower than the regulatory limit of 25 percent, according to the Bangladesh Bank. Banks can build up the fund from their own source or take the money from the central bank through repo at 5 percent rate. They can lend this money to their subsidiaries, such as merchant banks and brokerage houses, at 7 percent interest rate. The tenure of these kinds of loans will end on February 9, 2025. Such loans will not be considered with the banks' advance deposit ratio. The central bank also imposed some conditions about which kind of shares banks can invest the money on. They are not allowed to purchase shares of their own company with this money. They can purchase shares not more than 2 percent of other banks and financial institutions and 10 percent of other companies. Furthermore, banks cannot purchase more than 10 percent units of a closed-end mutual fund and 15 percent of an open-end mutual fund. They can invest only in companies and mutual funds which have been making profits for the last three years. Earlier in September 2019, the central bank offered liquidity support to banks at only 6 percent interest to invest in shares. In 2010, the banks' overexposure contributed to a boom in price indices in the capital market. And the banks were allowed to invest 10 percent of their liabilities. Later, the government amended the Bank Company Act in 2013, limiting the banks' exposure to 25 percent.

{"title": "Stokes took cigarette break ahead of World Cup Super Over: New book", "body": "Star all-rounder Ben Stokes had sneaked off for a \"cigarette break\" in order to calm his nerves ahead of the Super Over during last year's epic World Cup final, an anecdote which finds mention in a new book on England's triumph. A year ago, England had claimed their maiden 50 over World Cup title after beating New Zealand by virtue of a contentious boundary count-back rule as scores were tied even after the Super Over. It was arguably one of the greatest finals in Cup history. On the first anniversary of that historic triumph, excerpts from a book called 'Morgan's Men: The Inside Story of England's Rise from Cricket World Cup Humiliation to Glory' has revealed the pressure that Stokes felt on that day at Lord's. \"Finding a quiet spot as the frenzy of the Super Over approached was hard in a ground packed out with 27,000 supporters and television cameras following the players from the middle, through the Long Room and up the stairs to the dressing room,\" authors Nick Hoult and Steve James wrote and the excerpt has been published by stuff.co.nz. \"But Ben Stokes had played at Lord's many times. He knows every nook and cranny. As Eoin Morgan tries to bring calm to the England dressing room and sort out their tactics, Stokes nips off for a moment of peace. \"He is covered in dirt and sweat. He has batted for two hours and 27 minutes of unbelievable tension. What does Stokes do? He goes to the back of the England dressing room, past the attendant's little office and into the showers. There he lights up a cigarette and has few minutes on his own.\" The 29-year-old Stokes was adjudged the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 84, plus eight runs in the Super Over, which helped England claim that momentous victory.

{"title": "Slain tech CEO posted video defending his company months before grisly death", "body": "Fahim Saleh, the tech CEO found decapitated and dismembered in his New York City apartment issued a passionate defense of his fledgling company just months before his grisly murder. He posted a YouTube clip in early February vowing to stand by his motorcycle ride-hailing app, Gokada, as it faced a crackdown from officials in its home base of Nigeria, New York Post reported. \"I'm never gonna give up, because that's the true attribute of an entrepreneur, never giving up,\" Saleh said in the five-minute monologue, which Gokada later shared on its Twitter account. \"Entrepreneurs are the ones that really change countries, that really change cities. They're the ones who bring the vision, they're the ones who bring the passion.\" The video was the last one Saleh's YouTube account published before police discovered his dismembered body in his Lower East Side home on Tuesday afternoon. Cops identified him as the victim of the grisly murder Wednesday morning. Saleh, who co-founded Gokada in December 2017, posted the video on Feb. 2, a day after the Nigerian city of Lagos banned the motorcycle taxis on which the company's business relied. Officials at the time pointed to \"scary\" numbers of fatal accidents as a reason for the ban, according to Reuters. But Gokada's drivers had a strong safety record with just 250 \"mostly minor\" accidents out of 350,000 rides they'd provided since September 2019, Saleh said in the video. He said he hoped to promote some of those drivers into higher positions within Gokada, which had received funding from Saleh's venture capital firm, Adventure Capital. \"Gokada is not just a business to me. It's a mission,\" Saleh said. \"And every part of that mission was always being safe, providing jobs. We do things that nobody else did in the market at the time.\" Gokada pressed on despite the ban — it launched a package delivery service in Lagos less than three weeks after the policy took effect and has kept it going through the coronavirus pandemic. \"Lagos, if you want amazing things to happen, support your entrepreneurs,\" Saleh said in the video. \"Support these great innovative businesses that are seeking to change Lagos — if not for Gokada, for the next Gokada, and for the one after that.\" The company announced Saleh's death on its Twitter account early Wednesday, calling him \"a great leader, inspiration and positive light for all of us.\" \"Fahim's vision and belief in us will be with us forever, and we will miss him dearly,\" Gokada said.

{"title": "Karachi mall inferno came after ignored warnings, delayed response", "body": "Muhammad Imran did not take the fire seriously at first, thinking it was another small spark at the Karachi mall that would be quickly extinguished by fellow shop owners. But smoke seeped through ducts and blackened the air in seconds. The lights went out soon after and phone flashlights turned useless, people could no longer see their own hands, he said. Imran, who has diabetes and has undergone heart surgery, managed only a few steps before nearly giving up. \"It felt like doomsday,\" he said. \"You couldn't see the person next to you.\" The blaze would rage for nearly two days and reduce Gul Plaza, a multi-storey complex of 1,200 family-run shops selling children's clothes, toys, crockery and household goods, to ash. At least 67 people were killed, with 15 still missing and feared dead, police official Asad Ali Raza said, in the 17 January blaze, the Pakistani port city's largest in over a decade. Imran's escape from the inferno, along with more than a dozen others who spoke to Reuters, was hampered by locked doors, poor ventilation, and crowded corridors. When they eventually got out, the survivors watched Gul Plaza crumble as rescue efforts faced delays and poor resources. Police said the fire appeared to have started at an artificial flower shop and may have been caused by children playing with matches. They added that all but three of the 16 exits were locked, which was routine practice after 10 pm. Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Gul Plaza, located on a major artery in Karachi's historic city centre and built in the early 1980s, had violated building regulatory standards for over a decade, with authorities warning the situation was dire in the last review two years ago. Gul Plaza's management did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Long paper trail Records from the provincial Sindh Building Control Authority showed court cases filed over Gul Plaza's lack of safety compliance in 1992, 2015 and 2021, as well as records of unauthorised construction. The files reviewed by Reuters do not detail the outcomes of those cases, including whether fines were imposed or whether violations were fully remedied. SBCA did not respond to queries on enforcement action taken. A 27 November 2023 survey by the fire department, covering more than 40 commercial buildings in the area, cited inadequate firefighting equipment, blocked escape routes, faulty alarms, poor emergency lighting and a lack of fire safety training for occupants and staff. A follow-up audit by the fire department in January 2024 placed Gul Plaza among buildings that failed to meet regulations, with inspectors marking key safety categories, including access to firefighting equipment, alarm systems and electrical wiring conditions, as \"unsatisfactory\". Separately, documents describing inspections by Karachi's Urban Search and Rescue teams in late 2023 and early 2024 that were reviewed by Reuters also showed Gul Plaza was among several markets and commercial buildings flagged for deficiencies in one or more fire safety categories. 'People were panicking' \"Young boys were crying. People were panicking,\" Imran said, when they were confronted by locked exits. Others smashed doors and locks as they moved through the darkness, holding hands and forming human chains to avoid getting lost. With no way down, they ran to the roof, where 70 people, including families and children, were trapped for nearly an hour, survivors said. The smoke was even worse there, funnelled upward by the building's design, making it impossible to see even the neighbouring buildings. Then the wind changed. A sudden gust pushed the smoke aside, revealing Rimpa Plaza next door. Young men crossed first, found a broken ladder and began ferrying people across one by one. \"I was the last to leave. I wanted to make sure everyone was safe,\" Imran said. An ambulance from the Edhi Foundation charity was waiting on the other side. Many survivors said the response by the fire brigade was delayed and inadequate. Imran and other shop owners said they had escaped from the building and watched Gul Plaza turn into a molten inferno as the first firefighters arrived. The first emergency call came at 10:26 p.m. from a teenager, with two fire vehicles reaching the site within 10 minutes and classifying the blaze as a Grade 3 fire, \"the highest category for an urban area\", said a provincial government spokesperson Sukhdev Assardas Hemnani. A citywide emergency was declared by 10:45 p.m., triggering the mobilisation of resources from across Karachi, he said. Shopkeepers said the first engine soon ran out of water and left to refill but Hemnani said those allegations were inaccurate. Firefighters used \"water, foam, chemicals and sand\", he said, adding the blaze was difficult to control because the building contained more than 50 gas cylinders and flammable material such as perfumes, generator fuel and car batteries. Many of the shops were stocked to the brim because of the holy month of Ramadan in February-March, Pakistan's biggest shopping season. The first fire truck was not delayed, Hemnani said, but later arrivals were slowed by heavy traffic on a busy Saturday night and a crowd of over 3,000 people that had gathered outside the mall. The fire department did not respond to requests for comment. 'No longer among us' Survivors said many of the missing were shop employees and traders who tried to help others escape — or went back inside looking for family members. Abdul Ghaffar, a toy store employee who had worked in Gul Plaza for two decades, said one of his cousins was among those still unaccounted for after helping others flee. His cousin's mobile phone voice message, in which he can be heard apologising to his family, was circulated widely on social media. \"He was helping people escape,\" Ghaffar said. \"That's how he died.\" Three other relatives remain missing, he said, with the family still waiting for identification through DNA testing. Several shopkeepers said the losses have scarred the market's tightly knit community. \"All of this keeps replaying in front of my eyes. People we saw daily are no longer among us. God was kind to us — our lives were saved — but I still cannot understand what kind of fire this was,\" said Imran.

{"title": "With inflation in India ticking higher it may be time for RBI to pause", "body": "With India's economic growth sputtering, the Reserve Bank of India was expected to maintain a rate-cutting cycle, but an uptick in near-term inflation could give the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee reason to pause for now. Having cut its key lending rate by an aggressive 115 basis points (bps) in 2020, on top of 135 bps cuts in 2019, the RBI so far has had little success in spurring credit growth amid varying degrees of lockdowns across India. Some economists and market insiders argue it may be prudent for the MPC, the policy committee, to hold its fire when it meets early next month. \"It's probably too early to administer a demand stimulus. The RBI still has room to cut rates, but we probably want to be more cautious of the timing,\" said Venkat Pasupuleti, portfolio manager at Dalton Investments. \"Maybe they should wait a quarter to see how things pan out once the lockdown situation is eased further.\" Market participants have factored in at least a 25 bps rate cut by the MPC on August 6 while analysts are predicting a total 50-75 bps cuts over the rest of the fiscal year that runs to March 31. The spike in the retail inflation rate above the RBI's mandated 2%-4% target range is another reason for the central bank to take a breather, analysts say. Annual retail inflation INCPIY=ECI rose to 6.09% in June, compared to 5.84% in March and sharply above a 5.30% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays, said the spike in both consumer and wholesale prices \"could lead to a tempering in enthusiasm for material front-loaded policy support from here on.\" Almost all economists however agreed the RBI cannot move away from its accommodative stance or call an end to the rate cutting cycle just yet. India's economy grew at 3.1% in the March quarter - an eight year low - and some economists have predicted a contraction of more than 20% in the June quarter and a contraction of up to 5% in the fiscal year. \"Even in the event of a pause, we think the RBI and MPC would want to hold out the promise of more cuts,\" said A. Prasanna, economist with ICICI Securities. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a recent speech the need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger, suggesting inflation concerns are unlikely to deter the downward trajectory for rates too soon. \"The August policy decision would boil down to a judgment call over whether RBI can maintain easy monetary and financial conditions without the aid of a token rate cut,\" Prasanna said.

{"title": "Italy pushes to end stalemate over single broadband network - source", "body": "Italy has told state-controlled utility Enel to reach a deal with Telecom Italia by the end of July on plans to create a single broadband network for the country, a person close to the matter told Reuters on Saturday. In an effort to close its digital gap with the rest of Europe, Italy has been pushing for a unified network combining Telecom Italia's (TIM) assets with those of Open Fiber, a wholesale-only operator owned by Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP). TIM, partly owned by CDP, has been in talks for months over a merger of its fibre network assets with those of Open Fiber, but differences over issues such as governance and regulation have created a deadlock. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri requested a memorandum of understanding be signed by the end of the month at a meeting with Enel chief Francesco Starace on Friday, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Rome has already been pushing Enel and TIM to join forces, but Gualtieri's deadline was the most concrete step to break the stalemate over the network expected to underpin the development of Italy's digital economy. The economy ministry and Enel both declined to comment. TIM was not immediately available for comment. TIM's insistence on retaining control of any combined entity with Open Fiber has also held up a deal. But pressure for agreement has increased as TIM has held talks with US private equity fund KKR about selling 40 percent of its secondary or last-mile copper and fibre network from the street cabinet to users' homes. With a binding offer expected before Aug. 4 that could see the US fund taking a significant position in Italian telecoms infrastructure, the Treasury wants to nail down guarantees from Enel over the broadband network plan. To balance KKR's presence, the government would be in favour of the CDP taking a stake in the secondary network but any such deal would not be in the public interest without guarantees from Enel on the broadband network plan, said the source on Saturday. Complicating the discussions is a separate offer from Australian fund giant Macquarie for all or part of Enel's 50 percent stake in Open Fiber that sources say values the wholesale operator at almost $8 billion.

{"title": "Legal clouds, labour fury trail interim govt's push on Ctg port deal", "body": "A high-stakes race to hand over Bangladesh's most profitable maritime asset to a foreign operator has ignited a firestorm of legal challenges, labour strikes, and allegations of massive financial undervaluation. Under the watch of an interim administration, the Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) is fast-tracking a 15-year concession for the New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT) to UAE-based DP World. While officials defend the move as a necessary leap towards global efficiency, critics argue the deal is being \"rammed through\" just days before national elections and in defiance of a sub judice court process. At the centre of the controversy is the New Mooring Container Terminal (NCT), a strategic facility that handles around 90% of Bangladesh's containerised cargo. The Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) has moved to lease out the terminal and its adjacent Overflow Container Yard to UAE-based global operator DP World for 15 years under a government-to-government arrangement. The move has raised concerns among economists and labour leaders over whether the interim government has the mandate to finalise a long-term international concession involving a strategic national asset. Critics have also questioned the valuation and single-bidder nature of the process, while officials argue the deal is necessary to expand capacity and improve efficiency at the country's main maritime gateway. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel The government has not publicly responded to questions about the interim administration's legal authority to sign long-term concessions. Timeline set before court verdict Documents reviewed by The Business Standard reveal that the CPA issued a 63-page RFP on 8 January, seeking proposals for the operation and maintenance of the NCT and its Overflow Container Yard. Crucially, this occurred three weeks before the Supreme Court's 29 January ruling, which upheld the legality of the leasing process. The deadline for clarification was 11 January, with pre-bid meetings held on 14 and 15 January. An addendum followed on 20 January, and the bid submission deadline has been fixed for 19 February 2026. Security tightened at Chattogram Port amid work stoppage on 1 February 2026.

Once they are completed, the concession agreement can be signed anytime this week before the election,\" the official said. Legal experts have questioned the propriety of proceeding while the matter was sub judice. Barrister Anwar Hossain, representing the petitioners, told TBS, \"When a matter is sub judice, you cannot proceed with it. If the CPA submitted the RFP and held meetings during the court hearing, they defied the court.\" He added that an application seeking a status quo on the verdict has already been filed. \"Even if the court sends the appeal to a full bench without issuing a status quo, the authority is not legally allowed to proceed with the agreement,\" he said. Labour strike disrupt port operations The proposed handover has triggered strong resistance from port workers. A two-day eight-hour work abstention from Saturday to Sunday, followed by another protest today (2 February), paralysed cargo handling and vessel movement at Chattogram Port. Workers today announced a further 24-hour strike from 8am tomorrow, which they say coincides with an initial target date for signing the concession agreement. Chattogram Port.

Labour leaders argue that NCT is a highly profitable facility and accuse authorities of undervaluing it. According to them, the current tariff generates around $161 per TEU at NCT. Even if operating costs are estimated at $56 per TEU, the port earns roughly $105 per container. \"The CPA and the Rate Negotiation Committee want to hand over NCT to DP World at $105 per TEU. A top government official is pressuring Chattogram Port to hand it over at just $42 per TEU,\" alleged Humayun Kabir, coordinator of the Bandar Rokkha Sangram Oikya Parishad. CPA documents reviewed by TBS do not publicly disclose the basis for the proposed per-TEU rate. Another protesting leader, Ibrahim Khokan, questioned the urgency of the decision. \"The country will have an elected government in just 10 days. Why doesn't the interim government leave such a strategic decision to the elected government?\" he said, alleging personal interests behind the rush to finalise the deal. Lease process Operational since 2007, NCT is one of the most critical facilities at Chattogram Port, Bangladesh's principal maritime gateway. The brownfield riverine terminal has an 820-metre quay wall, four container berths and extensive back-up facilities. The adjacent Overflow Container Yard, developed in 2015, provides additional container storage. According to the RFP, the government aims to expand port capacity and improve efficiency to support growing manufacturing and export sectors. DP World was selected as the potential partner, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) acting as transaction adviser. The concession includes a transition period of up to six months, followed by a 15-year operation and maintenance phase. At the end of the term, the facilities will revert to the CPA at no cost, except for any additional equipment installed by the operator. A feasibility study estimates the project cost at $205 million. Containers at Chattogram Port.

{"title": "India to recreate 'Operation Sindoor' at upcoming Republic Day parade", "body": "The Indian military is set to recreate its tri-services campaign against Pakistan from last May during the 77th Republic Day Parade in New Delhi on 26 January. The display, an annual exhibition of the country's military and diplomatic reach, will feature the specific aircraft formations and hardware used during the 88-hour conflict. Air Commodore Manish Sabharwal told the media during a briefing that the military aims to showcase all platforms used during the operation. A highlight of this year's flypast will be a special seven-aircraft formation consisting of two Rafales, two Su-30s, two MiG-29s, and a single Jaguar aircraft, all of which were active participants in \"Operation Sindoor\" between 7 and 10 May last year. Operation Sindoor was launched by the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Indian Army on 7 May last year following a 'militant attack' in Pahalgam, a popular tourist resort in Jammu and Kashmir, which left 26 people dead. India stated the offensive was aimed at dismantling what it claimed as 'militant infrastructure' across the border. Wing Commander Rajesh Deshwal noted that the tableau would move down Kartavya Path in formations mirroring a battle scenario, beginning with reconnaissance and followed by logistics and personnel in full battle gear. The tri-service tableau is being framed by Indian defence officials as an authoritative representation of a \"decisive transition\" to precision and integrated warfare. The display will open with the Indian Navy's maritime dominance, transitioning to the Army's M777 Ultra-Light Howitzer guns. The demonstration may also feature the Akash Air Defence System and loitering munitions, the latter of which was reportedly used to neutralise radar systems during the conflict. The sequence further illustrates the Rafale executing strikes with SCALP missiles and the SU-30 MKI launching BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles against hardened shelters. The display culminates with the S-400 system, which India claims executed the operation's longest-range engagement at 350km against an airborne early-warning platform. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will also use the parade to unveil several indigenous technologies. Chief among these is a hypersonic glide missile designed for coastal defence. The missile is reportedly capable of flying at low altitudes with high speed and manoeuvrability, making it difficult for ground and ship-based radars to detect. The parade will be witnessed by several foreign dignitaries, including European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who are attending as guests of honour.

{"title": "Police body camera footage emerges of George Floyd's death", "body": "New police body camera videos have been shown in which George Floyd is seen pleading with officers as they try to force him into their car, US media say. Reports are saying, Floyd told the Minneapolis officers he could not breathe, asking if he could lie on the ground instead, reports BBC. A district judge allowed news outlets to view the two videos, which show the clearest picture yet of Floyd's last moments in Minneapolis on 25 May. All four officers involved have since been fired and charged over his death. Derek Chauvin, who in a separate video filmed by eyewitnesses was seen kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes, has been charged with second-degree murder. The three other officers - Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao - have been charged with aiding and abetting murder. The death of Floyd, a 46-year-old unarmed African American, sparked huge protests across the US against police brutality and racism. In a separate development on Wednesday, Floyd's family sued Minneapolis and the four policemen for wrongful death. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said the suit was seeking monetary damages on behalf of Floyd's children and siblings. What did the videos show? The body camera recordings from Lane and Kueng form part of the ongoing case against all four police officers. Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill allowed news outlets to view the videos, which have so far not been made public. Previously, only transcripts were made public. The videos begin as Minneapolis police officers Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng are seen responding to a call over a fake banknote being used at a local market, according to CNN. It says that just seconds after speaking with a store employee, the officers were at the door of the car Floyd was in and, after an initial knock with a torch, Lane points a gun at Floyd and orders him to put his hands up. Floyd is seen sobbing and pleading with the officers, and is then pulled from the vehicle as the officers struggle to handcuff him. A big struggle ensues when Lane and Kueng attempt to put him in the police car. Eventually, Floyd falls out of the car, and it is at this point that the other two officers, Thao and Chauvin, appear in the videos, CNN reports. They all try to restrain the suspect, and Chauvin is later seen kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck. During this time Floyd is heard more than 20 times telling the officers that he cannot breathe.

He added that the process of returning depositors' money has also been designed strictly in accordance with Shariah Council guidelines. The governor clarified that the government is not only returning the principal amounts. \"Investment profits or interest that were recorded on paper up to 2024 will also be paid to depositors.\" \"If someone kept their money in these banks for a long period … say, 10 years … they will receive their full principal along with the returns that were shown for that period,\" he said. \"Even if those investments were mismanaged or did not actually take place due to failures of the previous management, the decision has been made to compensate depositors in full,\" he added. Mansur added that although Islamic banking principles generally require losses from genuine investments to be shared among partners, in this case the losses have not been passed on to depositors. Instead, the government has assumed responsibility for the losses. According to the governor, revised accounts for the 2024–25 fiscal year show significant financial losses at these banks, but neither past nor current losses have been imposed on depositors. \"There are some limitations under Islamic Shariah principles, which is why not all additional benefits could be provided. However, both the actual deposits and the profits recorded on paper have been paid,\" he said. The governor also mentioned that a small group of troublemakers attempted to create unrest at several branches, particularly Union Bank, but no major damage occurred. He urged ordinary depositors not to be influenced by such activities. Reassuring the public once again, Ahsan H Mansur said that after the appointment of new management, especially for deposits made after the first of this month, there are no restrictions on withdrawals.

{"title": "The battle for Sonadia: An island caught between profit and preservation", "body": "The mist often clings to the shoreline of Sonadia Island, a nine-square-kilometre sanctuary of mangrove and salt air tucked away in Kutubjom Union of Maheshkhali. For centuries, the island has been a quiet sentinel of the Bay of Bengal, expanding and breathing with the tides. In recent years, however, this small island became the centre of a tug-of-war between ambitious industrial development and the urgent need for ecological preservation. Today, Sonadia stands at a crossroads, having narrowly escaped a massive transformation, yet still bearing the deep scars of that attempt. The modern struggle for Sonadia began in 2016. The Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) launched an ambitious initiative to attract foreign tourists by developing three large tourism parks in the Teknaf and Maheshkhali upazilas, covering a total of 11,000 acres. While Sabrang Tourism Park was planned for 967 acres and Naf Tourism Park for 271 acres, the crown jewel was the proposed Sonadia Eco-Tourism Park, spanning a staggering 9,467 acres. For the construction of this project, the Cox's Bazar district administration allotted the land to BEZA in 2017 at a token amount of just Tk1,001. The vision was grand. An Indian firm, Mahindra Engineering, was commissioned to draft a master plan for what was envisioned as the country's largest and most sophisticated eco-tourism destination. However, the lease came with a strict legal caveat under the Environment Conservation Act of 1995, which prohibited any activity that could negatively affect the island's environment. Despite these conditions, the island remained under BEZA's control for eight years, during which development activities were initiated. The promise of a sustainable park quickly soured for environmentalists and lawyers. On 28 October 2024, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) filed a writ petition with the High Court, arguing that constructing such a park in an Ecologically Critical Area violated existing law. The legal battle reached a turning point on 26 November 2024, when a High Court bench issued an order suspending all activities for six months. Finally, on 17 March this year, the government officially cancelled the land settlement granted to BEZA. By 5 May 2025, a memorandum signed by Masud Kamal, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Land, formally returned the 9,467 acres — comprising 2,712 acres in Sonadia, 4,839 acres in Samudra Bilas, and 1,918 acres in Char Mokbul — to the Forest Department. To understand why the cancellation of the lease was met with such relief, one must examine Sonadia's unique biological system. The island is home to the only saline-water mangrove forest along Bangladesh's south-eastern coast. This green belt serves as a vital shield against natural disasters, acting as a buffer that absorbs the fury of the sea before it reaches the mainland. Sonadia's importance is not merely local; it is global. A 2019 survey conducted by the government's Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services identified three globally endangered bird species on the island, including the elusive spoon-billed sandpiper.

The island is home to the only saline-water mangrove forest along Bangladesh's south-eastern coast. This green belt serves as a vital shield against natural disasters, acting as a buffer that absorbs the fury of the sea before it reaches the mainland. Approximately 170 species of migratory birds use Sonadia as a critical stopover, while its surrounding waters host Irrawaddy dolphins, Indo-Pacific dolphins and finless porpoises. Moazzem Hossain, chairman of Save the Nature of Bangladesh, emphasises that Sonadia and the adjacent Hasher Char are the lifeblood of marine biodiversity. \"Every year, three species of marine turtles, including the green sea turtle, crawl onto these sands to lay more than 20,000 eggs. These turtles are ecological workers. \"They help control the breeding of harmful organisms that destroy fish eggs and fry, thereby maintaining the balance of fish production across the Bay of Bengal. Within the island's forest and surrounding waters, a symphony of life exists, consisting of 19 species of shrimp, 14 species of snails and oysters, and various species of crabs,\" he added. Commercially vital fish such as coral, boal, bata, tailla, datina, and kaun are found in abundance. For nearly 3,000 residents of Kutubjom union, these waters are both their grocery store and their bank, as most earn their livelihoods from marine fishing and dried fish processing. The island contains approximately 30 species of plants, including keora, keya, white bain, black bain, horgoja, and nonia. Environmental activists believe that the recent decision to protect this forest will safeguard the breeding grounds of marine turtles and prevent irreversible damage to the wider ecosystem. Declaring the 9,467 acres of forestland a protected area is also expected to curb illegal activities and improve disaster resilience. Beyond its biodiversity, Sonadia Island hosts substantial reserves of economically valuable heavy minerals, according to a recent study published in Discover Geoscience. The research estimates around 700,000 tonnes of minerals, dominated by garnet (51.52 %) and ilmenite (38.14%), with smaller quantities of magnetite, zircon, rutile, and trace monazite. These minerals are more concentrated in sand dunes than along the foreshore, with dunes alone containing over 276,000 tonnes of garnet and 215,000 tonnes of ilmenite. Garnet is widely used as an industrial abrasive, while ilmenite is a key source of titanium. Although modest compared to earlier regional estimates, experts say even limited commercial extraction could generate significant revenue. However, scholars warn that these minerals contain rare earth elements that are highly sought after globally. Mohammad Bodruddoza Mia, professor at the Department of Geology, University of Dhaka, cautions against rushing into foreign contracts. \"The government should strengthen its own public institutions to study and manage these resources carefully, while avoiding threats to the island's fragile ecosystem,\" he said. The scars of progress: Unauthorised destruction Despite the legal victory of returning the land to the Forest Department, the reality on the ground remains grim. Since 2017, under the shadow of BEZA's acquisition, the island's social and natural fabric has steadily unravelled. When the entire island came under BEZA's control, basic social services collapsed. Healthcare all but disappeared. For many residents, giving birth now feels like a crime. Saju Begum, a woman with basic health training, has become the island's sole refuge in the absence of doctors, distributing oral saline and painkillers to those in need. Education has fared no better. The only primary school is located far from many households, and teachers are frequently absent, leaving a generation of children — such as teenager Jainal — unable to study beyond the fifth grade. The environmental damage is even more visible. Following the lease, organised groups carried out widespread looting of the green belt, felling nearly 70% of the trees, including jhau and keora. Excavators were used to strip soil and flatten land, leading to the construction of shrimp enclosures across 3,000 acres, with another 2,000 acres currently being prepared for expansion. Perhaps the most pressing concern today is the surge in unauthorised tourism. Since St Martin's Island was closed, tourists have flocked to Sonadia, with roughly 1,000 visitors arriving each month. Several resorts — including Sandy Beach Resort, Camp Fire Sonadia, and Marina de Sonadia — have been built illegally by clearing jhau forests. These establishments run generators throughout the night, using red and blue lighting that conservationists warn disrupts the natural behaviour of nesting turtles. One resort owner, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted that they can already accommodate 100 guests and have confirmed bookings through December, despite the Department of Environment stating that no permission has ever been granted for such structures. Abdul Kaiyum, Manager of Nature Conservation Management, warns that if these disturbances are not removed, turtles may stop coming to the beach altogether. Cox's Bazar Deputy Commissioner Md A Mannan claimed that the administration is unaware of the issue. \"We have not received any such information. However, since you have mentioned it, we will look into the matter,\" he said. The Ministry of Land's decision to cancel the allotment is a crucial first step, but forest officials say they are currently unable to take full legal action because the decision has not yet been formally gazetted. Chattogram Regional Conservator of Forests Mollah Rezaul Karim explained, \"We have not yet taken possession of Sonadia's land.

{"title": "Eyes on the stars: UAE’s Mars probe a first for the Arab world", "body": "The oil-rich United Arab Emirates has built a nuclear power programme and sent a man to space, and now plans to join another elite club by sending a probe to Mars. Only the United States, India, the former Soviet Union, and the European Space Agency have successfully sent missions to orbit the Red Planet, while China is preparing to launch its first Mars rover later this month. The UAE — a collection of sheikhdoms better known for its skyscrapers, palm-shaped islands and mega attractions — is now pushing to join their ranks in what will be a first for the Arab world. It will mark the 50th anniversary of its unification with \"Hope\", an unmanned spacecraft expected to reach its target in February after being launched on July 15 from Japan's Tanegashima Space Centre. While the mission objective is to provide a comprehensive image of the weather dynamics in Mars' atmosphere and pave the way for scientific breakthroughs, the probe is a foundation for a much bigger goal — building a human settlement on Mars within the next 100 years. Dubai has hired architects to imagine what a Martian city might look like and recreate it in its desert as \"Science City\", at a cost of around 500 million dirhams (135 million dollars). And last September, Hazza al-Mansouri became the first Emirati in space, part of a three-member crew that blasted off on a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan, returning home after an eight-day mission in which he became the first Arab to visit the International Space Station. \"Our grandparents followed the stars during their voyages in order to build their glories. Today, our children look at them to build their future,\" said Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in a tweet on Tuesday. – Global standing – The young Gulf nation — whose influence extends to Yemen, the Horn of Africa and Libya — hopes to elevate its status as a key regional player, building on its success in establishing itself as a centre for tourism, banking and services despite an economic downturn in recent years. Despite criticism of its involvement in the conflict in Yemen, which has turned into a quagmire for the Saudi-led military coalition, the UAE has elevated its standing with moves like hosting the first papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula and becoming the first Arab country to green-light a nuclear power plant. And over the last few decades it has become a hub for young Arabs aspiring to build professional careers and raise families in a safe environment, in a region too often blighted by war and political crises. For a country charting a course beyond the oil industry that it was built on, exploration is part of a long-term strategy. \"UAE figured out that space is very important for our development and sustainability. It's a bridge to the future,\" Mohammed al-Ahbabi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, told AFP. Sarah al-Amiri, 33, the mission's deputy project manager and also the UAE Minister of State for Advanced Sciences, said the trip to Mars is \"a message of hope for the region, to set an example of what is possible if we take the talent of the youth and use them positively, this is what's possible\". \"We've worked on investing in our space sector for over 15 years… it's about ensuring that this talent is developed for the rest of the region,\" she told AFP from Tokyo. In the runup to the Mars mission, the UAE announced it was opening its doors to Arabs across the region to take part in a three-year space programme. \"They can come in and gain experience and be the vehicles of change for the entire region. We cannot go about saying that this region is volatile and remain passive about it,\" Amiri said. \"People want stability, want opportunities,\" she added. The Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC), which spearheaded the Mars project on which some 450 people worked, more than half of them Emirati, is abuzz with excitement. \"This mission is showcasing that this is something we don't normally dream about… but understanding that these opportunities are there,\" said Mohsen al-Awadhi, the lead missions systems engineer.", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/eyes-stars-uaes-mars-probe-first-arab-world-104335", "date": "2020-07-10T10:50:00+06:00", "author": "BSS/AFP 10 July, 2020, 10:50 am Last modified: 10 July, 2020, 10:54 am", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 699, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:34:48.978911"}
{"title": "Why judging Bangladesh by its IQ score is misleading", "body": "A recent global ranking by World Population Review placed Bangladesh 150th out of 198 countries, assigning it an average IQ score of 74.33. The ranking draws on compiled studies by British psychologist Richard Lynn and relies on proxy indicators such as International Cognitive Ability estimates and PISA-related data. What is notable, however, is not the score itself but the reaction it provoked. As the figures circulated on social media, they triggered widespread insecurity and heated debate. A particularly troubling response was the way some people referred to the ranking to distance themselves from Bangladeshi identity, mostly to belittle others. In some cases, the score was even cited as an explanation for political instability, as if a single number could account for complex political realities. These reactions reveal more about our relationship with foreign metrics than about intelligence itself. Why do statistically fragile and culturally loaded cognitive tests carry such psychological authority in unequal societies — where millions lack access to quality education, nutrition, or test familiarity? It's not about whether Bangladeshis are \"smart enough,\" the problem lies in how intelligence is misread as a fixed national trait rather than a policy outcome shaped by material conditions. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel To understand why such rankings mislead, it is worth recalling what IQ tests were designed to do. Intelligence testing emerged in the early twentieth century as an administrative tool, not a measure of innate ability. In 1905, French psychologist Alfred Binet developed the first intelligence test to identify schoolchildren who required additional educational support. Binet explicitly warned against treating test results as permanent judgments or indicators of biological worth. The concept of the intelligence quotient was later introduced by William Stern, making cognitive ability easier to quantify and compare. This numerical framing enabled the rapid expansion of IQ testing, particularly in the United States, where Lewis Terman adapted Binet's work into the Stanford–Binet test. During World War I, mass testing of army recruits normalised large-scale IQ assessment but also detached it from its original, limited purpose. The developers of these IQ tests have assumed a largely homogeneous environment. But societies are not homogeneous — certainly not all countries. Bangladesh, in particular, is a highly heterogeneous society. Dr Md Abdus Salam, Professor, Institute of Education and Research (IER), Dhaka University Over time, IQ tests became tools of classification and exclusion, frequently stripped of cultural and social context. They were never designed to compare nations, yet they are now routinely used to rank entire populations. In doing so, structural inequalities are converted into cognitive deficits, and policy failures are quietly reframed as intellectual shortcomings. The recent data on IQ was published by the World Population Review. But the World Population Review did not conduct any research itself; it merely compiled data. In this case, it relied on Richard Lynn's studies. Lynn passed away in 2023. Therefore, these studies are by no means recent. Moreover, Richard Lynn described himself as a \"scientific racist.\" He believed IQ was related to race, arguing that superior races have higher IQs. A Guardian article refers to Lynn as \"one of the most significant figures in the scientific racism movement\" and notes that his work has been widely criticised for bias and for being used to support racist ideology. Moreover, the broader scientific community does not treat the IQ of any nation as a stationary figure. They consider the overall conditions of a country — nutrition, education, environment, and so on. When these factors improve, a nation's average IQ also tends to rise. Dr Md Abdus Salam, a professor in the Institute of Education and Research (IER) at Dhaka University, believes such tests measure our policy failures far more than they measure actual intellectual capacity. \"The developers of these IQ tests have assumed a largely homogeneous environment. But societies are not homogeneous — certainly not all countries. Bangladesh, in particular, is a highly heterogeneous society,\" said Dr Salam. For example, you cannot simply implement Finland's curriculum in Bangladesh. Finland's education system is built on a set of criteria and contextual conditions that are very different. The same applies to IQ testing: basic education itself is a foundational criterion. In countries like the US or Japan, there is a certain level of homogeneity in basic education and related structural factors. In a developing society like Bangladesh, that homogeneity does not exist. As a result, wide variations in outcomes are inevitable — and entirely expected. \"When you try to apply the same test or the same scale across countries, policy conditions must also be comparable. Without that, the results are bound to be misleading,\" Dr Salam added. The disproportionate attention given to this statistically fragile and methodologically weak foreign metric reveals the lingering influence of colonial frameworks that still shape how we perceive knowledge and competence. Rather than fixating on externally imposed rankings, our focus should be on strengthening the structural conditions that foster human development: improving education, nutrition, healthcare, and social infrastructure. These are the levers that genuinely shape cognitive and societal outcomes. Measuring intelligence through foreign metrics tells us little about actual ability; investing in policies that expand opportunity, reduce inequality, and enhance living conditions will yield far more meaningful results.

{"title": "From Apollo to Artemis: Nasa’s bid to rekindle lunar exploration", "body": "For the first time in half a century, Nasa is preparing to send astronauts back to the Moon. The Artemis programme, named after Apollo's twin sister, aims to rekindle human presence beyond Earth's orbit. Its upcoming mission, Artemis II, is scheduled for no earlier than February 2026 and will carry four astronauts on a ten-day journey around the Moon and back. It will be the first crewed lunar mission since Apollo 17 in 1972. The mission's goal is not to land on the Moon, but to test every system that would make future landings possible. Riding atop the powerful Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the Orion spacecraft will carry Nasa astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, along with Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Their journey will take them farther from Earth than any human has ever travelled. Artemis II is a crucial test of technology for Nasa. It follows Artemis I, an uncrewed test flight in 2022 that orbited the Moon and successfully returned to Earth, though not without challenges. Engineers discovered that the heat shield of Orion's capsule had charred and peeled in chunks during re-entry. The issue has since been resolved, however. Artemis II will mark the first time Nasa's SLS rocket carries humans. The spacecraft will orbit Earth, test its systems, and then perform a translunar injection to send the crew toward the Moon. Over the following four days, the astronauts will experience deep space radiation and microgravity as they circle the far side of the Moon — beyond the reach of real-time communication with Earth. The mission's purpose is more than exploration. It will gather vital data about how space affects the human body. Nasa scientists will study how radiation and microgravity influence astronauts' blood, sleep, and coordination. Tiny lab-grown organoids made from their cells will travel with them to record how living tissue responds to deep space conditions. Artemis II will also test manual manoeuvres in space, as astronauts practise docking simulations essential for future missions. Every moment aboard Orion is designed to prepare for the next giant leap — Artemis III, the long-awaited return to the lunar surface. But even if Artemis II succeeds, Nasa's path ahead remains steep. Artemis III depends on SpaceX's Starship Human Landing System, which must demonstrate complex refuelling and vertical landing capabilities before it can ferry astronauts to the Moon. While SpaceX's test flights have made progress, several have ended in fiery explosions. Nasa has stated that Artemis III will launch no earlier than mid-2027, but few expect that timeline to hold. The Artemis programme is no secret to the world outside the US — China has declared its intention to land astronauts on the Moon by 2030 and has already tested a prototype lunar lander. This growing competition adds urgency and pressure to Nasa's efforts. Artemis is ambitious but costly. Each SLS launch is estimated to cost around two billion US dollars. This has sparked debates in Congress over the programme's sustainability and whether Nasa should rely more on commercial launch providers in the future. For now, the project remains funded, but political and financial uncertainties linger, thanks to Donald Trump's surprise budget cuts. Beyond national prestige, Nasa must also demonstrate scientific value. The agency aims to build a permanent presence through a planned lunar space station called Gateway, which will orbit the Moon and serve as a base for future missions. Scheduled to begin deployment in 2027, Gateway will host international crews and experiments, marking a shift from the Apollo era's short-term visits to a new phase of sustained exploration. Still, the Artemis effort faces a question as old as the space race itself: can technological ambition outpace the political clock? The Apollo missions succeeded under intense Cold War competition and unified national focus. Today, Nasa operates in a world where long-term projects must survive changing administrations, shifting budgets, and commercial dependencies. Artemis II will therefore serve as both a technical and symbolic test. If successful, it will reaffirm the US's capacity for deep space exploration and inspire renewed global interest in lunar science. If delayed or flawed, it could embolden rivals and erode confidence in Nasa's ability to lead humanity's return to the Moon. More than five decades ago, the Apollo astronauts captured the world's imagination with their images of Earth rising above a barren lunar horizon. Now, as Artemis prepares for flight, the same question echoes once more — can humanity, through Nasa, land a second term on the Moon?

The exposed information included photographs, signatures, national identity card (NID) details, office ID cards, and media-related documents submitted by journalists while applying through the EC's website, reports Prothom Alo. The applications also contained institution-related information, including lists of journalists approved by media organisations. Ahead of the election and an upcoming referendum, the EC revised the rules for issuing cards to journalists. For the first time, it made online application through pr.ecs.gov.bd mandatory for obtaining journalists' cards and vehicle stickers. However, following demands from journalists, the EC withdrew the decision on Thursday (29 January) and opted to issue cards manually. Before the decision was reversed, nearly 14,000 journalists had already applied for cards and stickers through the online system. Yesterday (31 January), after 4pm, the personal information of journalists who had applied became publicly accessible on the EC's website. By replacing \"user\" with \"admin\" in the website URL, complete applications and related information could be viewed. The website's homepage displayed a list of applicants, along with names, NID numbers, mobile phone numbers and options to open full applications. By late evening, the website was no longer accessible. At around 9pm, Election Commission Secretariat Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed told Prothom Alo that he was not aware of the issue. \"This is not within my knowledge. I was in the office until 2:30pm today [Saturday], and nothing was known about it then. Since the afternoon, a few people have called to ask about the matter. It would not be right to comment without knowing what information was leaked and how. I will find out after going to the office tomorrow,\" he said. Director of the Institute of Information Technology at Dhaka University, BM Mainul Hossain, told Prothom Alo that digital systems primarily operate on trust. Tanvir Hasan Joha, a prosecutor at the International Crimes Tribunal and an information technology expert, described the incident to Prothom Alo as direct evidence of irresponsibility by a state institution. \"How can a constitutional body launch a system that has no data protection, access control or even basic security testing? The most important question is whether the personal data of these 14,000 journalists has been copied or accessed by any third party,\" he said. He added that those who often speak publicly about journalists' data protection, digital security and personal privacy are, in reality, the ones handing over such information to the most insecure systems.

{"title": "How Bangladesh engineered a power crisis it can no longer afford", "body": "Bangladesh's power sector has always been ambitious. It wanted to grow fast, build big, and finally silence the old jokes about load-shedding. In one sense, it succeeded: the country now has more installed capacity than it knows what to do with. In another sense, it has created a financial crisis so large that even the most creative accounting cannot hide it. A comprehensive review by the government's National Review Committee (NRC) finds that the problem lies not in unavoidable market shocks or temporary crises, but in deep-seated governance and contractual failures. The report matters because it arrives at a moment when the costs of those failures have become impossible to ignore. The mess we are in The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is now the epicentre of this crisis and the channel through which it spreads to the national budget and the wider economy. Its annual losses have exploded from Tk5,468 crore in FY15 to Tk50,565 crore in FY25, nearly a tenfold increase in a decade. Over the same period, government subsidies rose from Tk8,978 crore to Tk59,600 crore. These are not the numbers of a sector that is merely struggling; they are the numbers of a sector that has lost its financial anchor. The core problem is brutally simple: BPDB buys electricity at prices far higher than what it sells it for. Bulk supply costs have reached Tk12.35 per kilowatt-hour, while the weighted average bulk tariff remains Tk6.63. Closing this gap would require tariffs to rise by roughly 86%, just for BPDB to break even. If that happened, Bangladesh's industrial electricity prices would leapfrog those of Vietnam, China, India, and Pakistan by 80–90%. In a world where competitiveness is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour, such a shock would not merely hurt industry, it would risk pushing manufacturing elsewhere. Electricity would remain available, but increasingly unaffordable for the very sectors expected to drive growth. Erroneous capacity The irony is that Bangladesh did not arrive here because it lacked capacity. It arrived here because it built too much of the wrong kind, at the wrong price, under the wrong contracts. Between 2009 and FY24, installed generation capacity increased more than fivefold. Yet system-wide utilisation has hovered around 40–50% in recent years. In other words, on a typical day, roughly half the system sits idle. As of FY24, installed capacity exceeds system requirements by 5,600–6,700 megawatts even after accounting for prudent reserve margins. Under conservative assumptions, excess capacity still exceeds 3,000 megawatts. Add to this the 2,100–2,800 megawatts that cannot be dispatched due to fuel shortages, grid constraints, or logistical failures, and total idle capacity reaches 7,700–9,500 megawatts. This idle capacity is not just a technical inefficiency, it is a fiscal liability. The annual carrying cost of stranded capacity, measured through capacity payments alone, is estimated at $0.9–1.5 billion. This excludes fuel pass-throughs, foreign-exchange adjustments, late-payment surcharges, and contingent liabilities. The true cost is higher. Bangladesh has built a power system where the bills arrive even when the electricity does not, a feature it shares with gas. If overcapacity is one half of the crisis, overpricing is the other. A decade of contracts awarded without competition, without due diligence, and without alignment to fuel availability has produced a cost structure that is fundamentally unsustainable. Across technologies, premiums are consistently and unusually high. Solar power purchase agreements show premiums of 70–80%, heavy fuel oil plants, 40–50%, unsolicited gas projects, around 45%. The Adani Godda import contract is a masterclass in cross-border generosity, paying roughly 50% more for the privilege of importing electricity that could have been generated domestically. Add it all up and Bangladesh has achieved something extraordinary: a power system where the only thing more inflated than tariffs is the confidence with which the PPAs were signed. For a country still climbing the lower-middle-income ladder, this represents a remarkable achievement in one domain, behaving like a petrostate without the petro. While citizens juggle rising living costs, the nation has quietly become a global pioneer in a new development model, committing to pay nearly $1–1.5 billion a year for electricity it does not even use. These are not isolated mistakes made in good faith. They reflect a system that rewarded overpricing, encouraged unsolicited proposals, and normalised contracts that shifted risk to the public while guaranteeing profits to private parties. The scale of rent Seen in this light, Bangladesh's experience starts to resemble something more deliberate. Bangladesh may still be a lower-middle-income country, but it embraced a first-world hobby under the past regime: overpaying for everything. And that, in its own absurd way, is a kind of economic miracle. Payments to power producers have increased eleven-fold since FY11, while actual electricity generation rose only four-fold. Capacity payments alone have increased nearly twenty-fold. Taken together, the NRC's findings point to a conclusion that is uncomfortable precisely because it is so orderly. The fiscal strain now visible in BPDB's accounts is not the result of miscalculation or bad luck. It is the cumulative outcome of repeated decisions that prioritised contractual certainty for investors over affordability, efficiency, or system coherence. Once locked into long-term agreements, these costs became automatic, renewed each month, indifferent to demand, fuel availability, or economic context. At that point, overpayment ceased to be an anomaly and became a feature. What began as emergency accommodation evolved into routine practice, and routine practice hardened into a model. The rent extraction machine The now-repealed Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy Supply (Special Provisions) Act enabled such contracts without competitive bidding. But the deeper issue is institutional, a political economy that incentivised rent extraction. This conclusion follows from basic institutional logic rather than speculation about individual intent. The contracts in question were repeatedly approved over many years, across multiple projects, technologies, and sponsors, despite producing outcomes that were consistently fiscally damaging, commercially unbalanced, and far outside reasonable benchmarks. Occasional mistakes are possible in any system. Persistent replication of the same one-sided features, high guaranteed returns, weak risk sharing, limited competition, and insulation from downside risk, points instead to incentives embedded in the decision-making environment. In such settings, rational actors respond predictably. Where large, durable rents are created through contract design, and where discretion is normalised and oversight weak, those rents tend to be contested, allocated, and shared through political financing, influence, revolving-door relationships, or informal patronage. The alternative explanation, that successive officials repeatedly approved contracts misaligned with the public interest without learning or correction, would require assuming a level of sustained institutional irrationality that strains credibility. The more parsimonious explanation, consistent with the NRC's findings and BPDB's balance sheet, is that the system evolved to reward decisions that generated excess profits, and that these profits did not remain confined to the formal contract holders. The NRC report makes this visible. What happens next will determine whether BPDB's losses continue to spill into the national budget and the wider economy, or whether this accounting clarity becomes the starting point for unwinding a system that has become too expensive for the country to afford.

In a blistering statement issued on Saturday (3 January), Asif Nazul condemned the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for ordering the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release the pacer, accusing the Indian board of \"surrendering to radical communal groups.\" Asif Nazrul revealed he has instructed the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to lodge a formal written explanation with the International Cricket Council (ICC). The directive includes a specific request to relocate Bangladesh's World Cup fixtures to co-host nation Sri Lanka due to safety concerns. \"I have told the board to inform (the ICC) that where a single contracted Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India, the entire Bangladesh cricket team cannot feel safe going there to play the World Cup,\" Nazrul stated. Raising the stakes further, the adviser announced he has requested the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to ban the telecast of the IPL within Bangladesh. \"We will not accept insults to Bangladesh cricket, cricketers, and the nation under any circumstances,\" Nazrul declared. \"The days of slavery are over!\" The controversy began earlier on Saturday when KKR released Mustafizur following a BCCI directive triggered by political pressure. BJP leader Sangeet Som had praised the move as a \"victory for Hindus,\" citing alleged violence against minorities in Bangladesh. While the decision drew support from India's ruling party, it faced sharp criticism from opposition figures.

{"title": "Money and job worries pose real risk to global recovery", "body": "The coronavirus pandemic is throwing the world into financial insecurity, posing a threat to the recession-hit global economy if it means consumers keep saving rather than spending. A new YouGov survey across 26 countries shows consumers everywhere are concerned about their jobs and household budgets. They're also cautious about spending or investing the money they do have. It suggests that signs of a rebound in some measures of activity -- cited by a number of policy makers as reason for optimism -- will take time to get people back in shops, airports or restaurants. Job security is a major concern for many, with more than 30% feeling less secure in their job than a month ago, while around half of respondents are still cutting back on non-essential expenditure. In a further sign of caution, Americans would be around three times more like to save rather than spend an unexpected cash windfall, rising to more than four times in the UK. The heightened job concern follows a brutal second quarter for employment, when the International Labour Organization estimated that damage to the labor market from virus lockdowns and other restrictions was equivalent to a loss of 400 million full-time jobs. Those worries remain even as lockdowns have eased considerably, according to YouGov's Economic Recovery Tracker, which is based on 27,681 respondents and was shared exclusively with Bloomberg. In most countries, the proportion of those worried about losing employment is within 10 percentage points of levels eight weeks ago. In the US, which has seen a renewed flare up of the virus, concerns are mounting again, with 23% feeling less secure about their job compared with 18% two weeks ago. That worry is translating into caution about money. Asked what they would do with an unexpected cash windfall equivalent to a month's income, respondents are far more likely to bank it. Thirty seven percent of American respondents said they'd save versus 13% who would spend. The UK ratio was even more stark: 58% to 13%. The story was similar across the world, with more than 40% choosing to save in Australia, India, France, Indonesia, Norway, and Canada. A small proportion would invest in the stock market, though every country bar one came in below 20%. All responses across Group of Seven nations were in the single digits. Meanwhile, in all countries, around 1-in-4 households have dug into savings to help them through the crisis, while more than 10% have taken on more debt. But with the fear of job loss, or a hit to income, people have favored cutting back on spending rather than stretching their finances too much. According to the poll, the proportion \"actively reducing non-essential expenses\" is far higher than those who've relied on savings to cover costs.

{"title": "How imported second-hand clothes keep Bangladesh warm", "body": "If you walk along Sadarghat's Northbrook Hall Road by the river, you will notice shops whose nameplates do not match their ware. These shops were once hubs for wholesale vegetable trading. Now they are stacked with used clothes brought from Chattogram, which have been imported from some Asian countries. Demand rises sharply when forecasted cold waves begin to bite into the lives of middle- and lower-income people. These clothes arrive in tightly packed bags, tied with flattened ropes and wrapped in square-shaped plastic packaging. Traders locally refer to these bags as \"bale\", while some call them \"guide.\" Wholesale traders open intact bales, while retailers come from different parts of Dhaka and inspect the opened bales, sorting through the garments. Some choose specific items, while others purchase entire bales. Tulsideb Saha came to buy some clothes for his footpath shop near Baitul Mukarram. He has been in this business since 1972. He stood sorting through an unroped bale. He then explained his buying strategy, \"About a month ago, I stocked two bales of clothes at my shop. Now I've come again to buy more. This time, I will not take one whole bale, I will buy 200 jackets and 100 sweaters instead.\" Temporary footpath shops, particularly in New Market, Motijheel, Baitul Mukarram, Gulistan, Paltan, and Mirpur, are filled with used winter clothing. Jackets, sweaters, cardigans, shirts, mufflers, caps, blankets, and comforters of various designs and qualities are being laid out or hung for display. However, the largest wholesale and retail markets for used clothing are in Chattogram. Since imported garments arrive through Chattogram Port, most of the clothes are first stored at Amin Market in the city's Khatunganj and in the Majhirghat area after being moved directly from the port. From there, wholesalers supply these clothes across the country based on demand. According to Abul Kalam, President of the Bangladesh Used Clothes Traders Welfare Association, \"From Khatunganj, Majhirghat, and Zohura Market, traders from across the country buy used clothing bales.\" Outside Dhaka and Chattogram, demand is particularly high among middle- and lower-income groups in colder regions, where winter conditions are harsher and affordable warm clothing is a necessity rather than a fashion choice. Retailers in Dhaka mostly source clothes from Sadarghat's North Brook Hall Road market and Mallik Tower near Banglabazar Mor. Some vendors also collect garments directly from Chattagram through trusted suppliers. An 80–100 kg bale of zipped jackets can cost between Tk18,000 and Tk35,000, depending on quality and country of origin, while bales of sweaters and other small garments cost Tk15,000–25,000. Blankets and comforters are priced at around Tk12,000–20,000 per bale. However, shirts and stylish jackets are mostly sold by the piece due to quality concerns. One hundred shirts can cost approximately Tk25,000, but when the quantity increases to 200 pieces or more, the total cost decreases by at least Tk10,000, meaning 200 shirts can be purchased for around Tk40,000. \"Products from South Korea and Japan are of better quality. Whether it's jackets or shirts, some clothes look almost new, which is why they cost more,\" Tulsideb said. This is also a seasonal business, involving everyone from footpath hawkers to small entrepreneurs. \"Someone can start this business with as little as Tk20,000 to Tk50,000, and the profit margin is quite good,\" said a wholesaler at the Khatunganj market. Hawkers adjust their products according to the season, like Rubel Hossain in Purana Paltan, who is selling blankets, comforters, and curtains on the footpath this season. \"Earlier this year, throughout the summer season, I was selling shirts, pants, and trousers. Now I am selling these winter items. When winter ends, I will switch to something else,\" he said. \"Business is not what it used to be. Three to five years ago, I used to sell at least 20 to 25 blankets a day. Now I cannot even sell 10,\" he added. Blankets and comforters are priced at around Tk12,000–20,000 per bale. However, shirts and stylish jackets are mostly sold by the piece due to quality concerns. One hundred shirts can cost approximately Tk25,000, but when the quantity increases to 200 pieces or more, the total cost decreases by at least Tk10,000, meaning 200 shirts can be purchased for around Tk40,000. Second-hand imports helping millions stay warm in winter During the evening rush hour, hawkers spread piles of used warm clothes, heavy jackets, sweaters, and cardigans on tarpaulins along the roadside in front of New Market in Chattogram. Passersby crowd around, seeking affordable winter wear, as vendors call out to attract buyers, offering warm garments suited to the needs of middle- and low-income customers. \"These clothes are good. Once they are washed and ironed, they look almost new. People like us cannot always afford to buy new clothes. An item that would cost Tk 800–1,000 new can be bought here for Tk 400–500, and often in even better condition,\" said Ruma Haque, a regular customer. Prices are flexible, and good bargaining can secure a full winter wardrobe for under Tk2,000. Imported second-hand clothes are displayed on the footpath near capital's Baitul Mokarram mosque. In Dhaka, the sales continue until 10–11 pm. According to the Hawkers' Association, at least 60 used-clothes vendors operate in front of the Baitul Mukarram mosque, while the number exceeds 100 in the New Market area. Vendors said sales typically remain slow at the start of winter but increase as the cold intensifies. Outside major cities, temporary stalls are set up in open market spaces in district and upazila towns as soon as winter begins, especially in colder regions. With demand rising during the season, the supply of winter clothing also remains high. \"In colder regions, particularly in the northern and southern parts of the country, local people depend heavily on imported used clothes,\" said Saimun Amin, a former Dhaka University student who leads a Rangpur-based organisation that has been raising funds and distributing winter clothing in the north for the past five years. Form a charity programme to import business After Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the country was devastated by war, leaving many families unable to afford warm clothing. At the time, Western NGOs, particularly England-based Oxfam, organised charity drives and sent warm clothes, blankets and other essential items to Bangladesh. Recalling the period after the war, Tulsideb Saha said he was 15 when the conflict ended and that life was especially difficult during the winter, until the government arranged relief clothing. Tulsideb Saha, who has been in the second-hand clothes business since 1972, is in front of his shop. He added that once supplies began arriving, they continued. Initially, clothes arrived from the US, Australia, England, Japan, and some European countries Today, Bangladesh mainly imports used clothes from Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China, and occasionally from Malaysia and Pakistan. According to the Office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, the government allows 3,000 traders to import used clothing, permitting Tk50,000 worth of imports per trader, which amounts to Tk15 crore annually. FBCCI member SM Jalil explains, \"We are allowed to import six types of garments: men's sweaters, zipper jackets/coats, cardigans, men's trousers, blankets, and shirts.\" With this amount, an estimated 500–700 containers of used clothing are imported, each carrying around 250–300 bales. The import season usually runs from April–May to October each year. Volumes were higher before the growth of the RMG industry during and after General Ershad's tenure. Mohammad Golam Mostafa, assistant controller at the Chief Controller's office, said, \"Importers operate through appointed agents who collect garments and facilitate the import process.\" \"No one can import goods simply by choice. Importers must follow prescribed procedures, and everything has to go through legal channels,\" he said. However, traders said the decades-old business has been shrinking since the Covid-19 pandemic due to import cuts, quotas and increased local garment production, even as demand continues to rise. Calling for a higher import cap, trader Kalam said raising the limit from Tk150 million to Tk300 million would benefit both consumers and traders, lower prices further, and make affordable winter clothing accessible to more people. An 80–100 kg bale of zipped jackets can cost between Tk18,000 and Tk35,000, depending on quality and country of origin, while bales of sweaters and other small garments cost Tk15,000–25,000.

Blankets and comforters are priced at around Tk12,000–20,000 per bale. However, shirts and stylish jackets are mostly sold by the piece due to quality concerns.

Second-hand imports helping millions stay warm in winter During the evening rush hour, hawkers spread piles of used warm clothes, heavy jackets, sweaters, and cardigans on tarpaulins along the roadside in front of New Market in Chattogram. Passersby crowd around, seeking affordable winter wear, as vendors call out to attract buyers, offering warm garments suited to the needs of middle- and low-income customers. \"These clothes are good. Once they are washed and ironed, they look almost new. People like us cannot always afford to buy new clothes. An item that would cost Tk 800–1,000 new can be bought here for Tk 400–500, and often in even better condition,\" said Ruma Haque, a regular customer. Prices are flexible, and good bargaining can secure a full winter wardrobe for under Tk2,000. In Dhaka, the sales continue until 10–11 pm. According to the Hawkers' Association, at least 60 used-clothes vendors operate in front of the Baitul Mukarram mosque, while the number exceeds 100 in the New Market area. Vendors said sales typically remain slow at the start of winter but increase as the cold intensifies. Outside major cities, temporary stalls are set up in open market spaces in district and upazila towns as soon as winter begins, especially in colder regions. With demand rising during the season, the supply of winter clothing also remains high. \"In colder regions, particularly in the northern and southern parts of the country, local people depend heavily on imported used clothes,\" said Saimun Amin, a former Dhaka University student who leads a Rangpur-based organisation that has been raising funds and distributing winter clothing in the north for the past five years. Form a charity programme to import business After Bangladesh's independence in 1971, the country was devastated by war, leaving many families unable to afford warm clothing. At the time, Western NGOs, particularly England-based Oxfam, organised charity drives and sent warm clothes, blankets and other essential items to Bangladesh. Recalling the period after the war, Tulsideb Saha said he was 15 when the conflict ended and that life was especially difficult during the winter, until the government arranged relief clothing. Tulsideb Saha, who has been in the second-hand clothes business since 1972, is in front of his shop. He added that once supplies began arriving, they continued. Initially, clothes arrived from the US, Australia, England, Japan, and some European countries Today, Bangladesh mainly imports used clothes from Asian countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China, and occasionally from Malaysia and Pakistan. According to the Office of the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, the government allows 3,000 traders to import used clothing, permitting Tk50,000 worth of imports per trader, which amounts to Tk15 crore annually. FBCCI member SM Jalil explains, \"We are allowed to import six types of garments: men's sweaters, zipper jackets/coats, cardigans, men's trousers, blankets, and shirts.\" With this amount, an estimated 500–700 containers of used clothing are imported, each carrying around 250–300 bales. The import season usually runs from April–May to October each year. Volumes were higher before the growth of the RMG industry during and after General Ershad's tenure. Mohammad Golam Mostafa, assistant controller at the Chief Controller's office, said, \"Importers operate through appointed agents who collect garments and facilitate the import process.\" \"No one can import goods simply by choice. Importers must follow prescribed procedures, and everything has to go through legal channels,\" he said. However, traders said the decades-old business has been shrinking since the Covid-19 pandemic due to import cuts, quotas and increased local garment production, even as demand continues to rise. Calling for a higher import cap, trader Kalam said raising the limit from Tk150 million to Tk300 million would benefit both consumers and traders, lower prices further, and make affordable winter clothing accessible to more people.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. SpaceX did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The reported fundraising target doubles prior reports, positioning the rocket and satellite company's listing as ‌the largest in history in terms of deal size, after Saudi Aramco's $29 billion IPO in 2019. The IPO gave Aramco a $1.7 trillion market capitalisation, and it was the only completed deal to have ‍achieved a valuation of more than $1 trillion. SpaceX Chief Financial Officer Bret Johnsen has held talks and Zoom calls with existing private investors since December to explore ⁠a mid-2026 IPO, the newspaper added. While Musk has long expressed a ‍preference for keeping SpaceX private, people familiar with his thinking indicated that the ‌company's ‌growing valuation and the success of its Starlink satellite-internet service have prompted a shift in strategy. SpaceX is lining up four Wall Street banks for leading roles in its market debut, Reuters reported last week, citing a ⁠source. Global financial markets ⁠are bracing for a year of potentially mega US listings, led by SpaceX, with artificial intelligence firms Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.

{"title": "ICC and players' body clash over rights ahead of T20 World Cup", "body": "Even before the T20 World Cup gets underway, the ICC is finding itself mired in controversy after controversy. The world governing body has already faced criticism from the global players' body, the World Cricketers' Association (WCA), over Bangladesh's exclusion from the tournament. Now the WCA and the ICC are locked in a new standoff. This time, the dispute centres on players' personal rights — including name, image and likeness — and the conditions of participation. According to a report by ESPNcricinfo, the WCA claims that the ICC has sent players a set of terms for the 2026 T20 World Cup that do not align with an agreement signed by both parties in 2024. The players' body argues that the newly proposed terms are far more \"exploitative\". The WCA has written to the ICC to express its concerns. In response, the ICC has said that the 2024 agreement applied only to eight national governing bodies (NGBs), and that the remaining World Cup participants are not covered by it. The eight boards cited by the ICC are Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, West Indies, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Bangladesh is not on the list after refusing to travel to India, with Scotland taking its place. Of the remaining 12 countries, the boards of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Oman and the United Arab Emirates do not recognise the WCA. As a result, players from those countries are not members of the association. While Italy, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Namibia, the United States and Canada do have players' associations, they had not received any participation terms as of 15 January. The WCA fears that the same \"controversial\" conditions will eventually be sent to them as well. The WCA maintains that the 2024 agreement was intended to apply to all its members, regardless of whether or not they were participating in the World Cup. Legally, the organisation argues, the agreement should be binding on all. In a memo sent to players on 15 January, WCA chief executive Tom Moffat highlighted inconsistencies across eight areas. These include media appearances, access to dressing rooms, use of players' personal data, commercial licensing and dispute resolution mechanisms. At the heart of the dispute is the issue of consent. The previous agreement stated that players would be able to negotiate, either individually or through the WCA, on all such matters. Under the ICC's new terms, however, players' consent would no longer be required; whatever the board decides would be final. Take, for example, the use of players' images. Under the new ICC terms, players would be obliged to license their images to any third party. An ICC partner could even promote a product using images of three players from the same team. By contrast, the 2024 agreement placed far stricter limits on such use and required consultation with the WCA. There is also disagreement over ownership of players' biological and personal data. The ICC wants to retain ownership of this information, allowing it to be used commercially with board approval. The WCA argues that players themselves are the rightful owners of their data and that it cannot be used without their consent. Perhaps the most contentious clause is one that deems a player's participation in the World Cup as automatic acceptance of all terms and conditions — whether or not they have actually signed the agreement. The WCA has strongly opposed this \"imposed consent\" approach. Moffat has accused the ICC and its member boards of working together to strip away protections that players are entitled to. He claims they are even seeking to \"own\" the players. In his view, those most at risk of exploitation under the proposed terms are lower-paid or semi-professional cricketers.

{"title": "Wirecard ex-COO Marsalek's entry into Philippines was faked, minister says", "body": "Immigration records showing Wirecard's former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek arrived in the Philippines on June 23 and departed for China the next day were falsified, Philippines Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said on Saturday. Guevarra said the immigration officers who inputted the fictitious entries have been relieved of their duties and face administrative sanctions. \"The investigation has now turned to persons who made the false entries in the database, their motives and their cohorts,\" Guevarra told reporters. Marsalek, 40, was fired as COO of the German firm on June 18 after auditor EY refused to sign off on Wirecard's accounts. The company, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, collapsed a week later owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a $2.1 billion hole in its accounts that auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. The missing money was purportedly held in escrow accounts at two Philippine banks, which have denied any links with the Wirecard. Guevarra said it was possible Marsalek could be in the country, telling Reuters, \"Notwithstanding the Bureau of Immigration report, I do not totally discount the possibility that Marsalek may be in the Philippines.\" \"We are an island country, and there are backdoors through which undocumented foreigners may slip through,\" he said. Munich prosecutors obtained arrest warrants against ex-CEO Markus Braun and Marsalek on June 22. Braun turned himself in that day, but Marsalek has disappeared and his mobile number is no longer in service. Both are suspected of market manipulation, false accounting and fraud, while the circle of suspects has widened to the entire management board of Wirecard. Marsalek's lawyer has declined all requests for comment. Marsalek had oversight of Wirecard's Asian operations, which are at the centre of suspicion by auditors and prosecutors of attempts to falsely inflate cash balances, turnover and profit. Guevarra said earlier immigration records had shown that Marsalek had been in the Philippines from March 3 to 5.

{"title": "Hunt for a living", "body": "Villages are now more vibrant than ever. Rural bazaars are crowded, tea-stalls are filled with customers, many of whom do not stay in villages this long in any given time. They are workers in motor workshops, or shopping malls or restaurants. They are owners of small businesses – perhaps a road-side tea-stall or a hair salon. They were doing whatever they could for a living in the cities and towns. Now they are forced into vacationing in their village homes since the general holidays enforced to contain the coronavirus outbreak threw them out of work. Millions of them have joined thousands of expatriates who came home from abroad and got stuck due to the pandemic. Spending time with families in villages does not bring any joy for them now. With chances of getting back to previous jobs – be it in Dhaka or in Kuwait – fading, they are worried about their living, their future. From Bandarban to Dinajpur, Brahminbaria to Bogura, Chuadanga to Barishal, the situation is the same. Jobs are scarce in villages. Some are trying their luck in farming vegetables, some are looking for money for starting a small business. Many have run out of whatever cash they had with them, and borrowed money from NGOs to meet daily needs. The Business Standard talked to a number of them to know how they were doing and what they were planning for the future. Abul Kalam came home on leave from Kuwait and got stuck in the coronavirus outbreak. Six months have passed since then. The office he used to work in said his job contract would not be renewed. He has no idea what to do now to run his family. \"I am thinking of a small business, but can't decide until the situation improves,\" says Kalam of Babuganj village in Barishal. Miraj Ali of Koyarkhali village of Jashore has a similar story to share. He lost his job in a filling station in Malaysia. He came home in March for a wedding and in June, he turned jobless. Motiur Rahman of Sonatola upazila of Bogura came home from Saudia Arabia in May and was supposed to go back by June 6. He has no idea whether he would be able to go back ever. He is now worried about repayment of the Tk2 lakh he borrowed from an NGO. Manik Mia of Dhunat upazila of the district returned from Malaysia and his brother Ahmed Ronju flew in from Kuwait amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The cash they brought home has been used up and they do not know what comes next. The story is more or less the same for Khyainuching Khiang of Bandarban sadar upazila, who returned from Macau of China and Kabir Hawladar, a Malaysia returnee of Barishal sadar upazila, or Reaz Maimun of Ramu in Cox's Bazar, who was running a business in Dubai, and Kuwait returnee Harez Ali of Chuadanga sadar. They came home before or during the outbreak. With the possibility of getting back to their overseas jobs dimming and cash in hand running out, they are worried about the days ahead. They are joined by millions of others, who returned to their village homes after losing jobs in cities and towns within the country. They were workers of the informal sector that accounts for 43% of the GDP according to the BBS. The shutdown enforced to slow the outbreak has stalled their lives as well. They lost their livelihood overnight and had to return to villages – a pandemic-induced trend termed \"reverse migration\". The general holiday or shutdown was initially enforced for a week from March 26, then extended in phases for 66 days. And the wait of millions of informal sector workers and small business operators lingered on. Though the business activities have resumed, the pace was not enough to absorb the full workforce as before. Md Arif of Dinajpur sadar upazila was running a hair salon in Dhaka with a partner. He returned home since his shop was shut on March 25 and his family is now living on the incomes of his father and brother. Sohel Rana of the same area lost his restaurant job in Dhaka and opened a laundry business in his village home just to earn Tk 20 or 30 a day. Fahim Shahriar worked in a book shop at Andarkilla in Chittagong and earned Tk10,000 a month to support his mother and sister at home. Now he is out of a job. Factory workers are no better either. Anarul Huq lost his job as a cutting master in a Naraynagnj garment factory and has been staying in his village home in Chuadanga sadar upazila since then. He does not own any land to try vegetable farming nor has he got anything else to earn. After losing his job in a garment factory in Dhaka, Hasan Ali returned to Jashore with his wife and a child. He is now staying with his brother's family. Forkan Ali, now a 'former worker' of a Gazipur garment factory, tried his best for a job in Khulna, but failed. Getting a job is even more impossible for Helena Begum, who is now back in her village home in Digholia upazila of Khulna. She was a domestic help, but her employers asked her to discontinue since the outbreak of coronavirus. \"There is no work in the village. I am in distress with my children,\" she says. Young Power in Social Action (YPSA) has surveyed some of the expatriates in Chattogram who have returned home during the pandemic. It found that 60% of the expatriates have already spent the money they brought with them. Now they are borrowing from relatives. At least 50,000 expatriates came home on leave between January and May. They are not sure when they will be able to go back to work, said Abdul Gafur, manager of the social organization YPSA. Jhilongja UP chairman of Cox's Bazar sadar Tipu Sultan said, \"There are many expatriates in my union and some 50 are now stuck due to coronavirus outbreak. Some of them are now driving tom-tom for a living.\" Local administrations do not keep records of how many expatriates are at risk of losing jobs. They do not have any idea how many people of the locality returned home after losing jobs in cities and towns within the country. Deputy director of the Barishal employment and manpower office AKM Shahabuddin Khan says more than one lakh people of the district work abroad. On average 5,000 people used to go abroad for work every month from Barishal district before the pandemic. Overseas workers' migration has been stopped for the last 4/5 months, he informed. According to the special branch of district police, about 4,500 expatriates returned home between March 1 and July 1. The Manpower office does not have any record of how many of them have lost jobs. \"We have no idea of how many people returned from Dhaka or abroad. It could be possible if there was initiative in the past. No such list is prepared at union parishad level,\" says Azizur Rahman, upazila nirbahi officer of Bogura sadar. There are ways out Economists shared their concerns about absorbing those 'new unemployed' into work as they think many of these returnees might stay back home and the rural economy does not have enough space for the additional workforce. \"This reverse migration can only be made beneficial if we can provide productive employment opportunities in rural areas and education, health and other utility services can be made available in rural areas,\" says Dr Sayema Haque Bidisha, professor of Economics at Dhaka University. A number of policies, some of which may be long term, need to be considered to give them a sustainable livelihood, she stresses. The government has allocated Tk100 crore for small-employment schemes in rural areas, while a Tk20,000 crore stimulus package has been announced for macro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The allocation should be enhanced and conditions relaxed to make the offers effective, economists feel. It needs to be ensured that the stimulus money reaches the targeted people properly, says Dr Monzur Hossain, senior research fellow of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS). He believes that a longer moratorium on interest and principal repayment will help small business recoup losses and revive. Agriculture has never been a viable occupation and is not going to absorb the additional workforce, Dr Monzur said. So, he suggested, agro-processing and other rural based activities should be supported to rejuvenate rural economy and create jobs in rural areas. \"VAT waiver or other special offers can be made to encourage relocation of small and cottage industries from cities to villages,\" he said. Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) can have a crucial role to play in creating new jobs and self-employment opportunities in rural areas, says Md Abdul Karim, former principal secretary to the prime minister. Micro-enterprises are powerful job creators and if supported by appropriate policies and given easy access to formal finance, they can absorb the additional workforce, he believes. PKSF has identified more than 6700 business clusters of 77 economic activities including agriculture, livestock, fisheries and manufacturing. Micro-insurance can encourage more activities in these sub-sectors and cushion the entrepreneurs against any sudden blow like the one struck by the Covid-19 pandemic, he said, referring to the one he introduced for cattle farming when he was the managing director of PKSF. \"More people will be willing to raise cattle if they see just a one-time premium of Tk200 can protect a Tk1 lakh cow in case of death or lost,\" Md Abdul Karim told The Business Standard.

{"title": "News stands mostly without newspapers: What Dhaka's hawkers now sell to survive?", "body": "Before Dhaka's streets stir with the honking of rickshaws and the rush of office-goers, a different kind of symphony begins. At the newspaper distribution centres, the city's early morning rhythm is orchestrated by hawkers gathering their daily lifeline: the newspapers. In the 1980s, Dhaka had only six such centres. Hawkers from across the city would converge, each with little time in hand, hurriedly sorting stacks of papers before heading to their designated areas. Back then, morning newspapers were more than a commodity – they were a ritual. Middle-class households reached for them as soon as they woke, while the affluent and working-class alike ensured they were never left behind. Even young readers were ardent newspaper fans. For many, a day without newspapers simply did not start. Today, the bundles are much lighter – the crowds thinner. Compared to the 90s, newspaper consumption in Dhaka has fallen below 20%. And yet, the city still houses 4 to 5 thousand paper hawkers eking out a living. Newspaper stalls shrank to 30 Dhaka's newspaper hawkers are organised under two cooperative societies: Dhaka Sangbadpatra Hawkers' Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd (the older \"Hawkers' Samity\"). There is also the Sangbadpatra Hawkers' Welfare Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd (the \"Kalyan Samity\"). The former is older, while the latter is relatively new. Zakir Hossain Khan, the store in-charge at the Hawkers' Samity office near Dainik Bangla sits at his desk long after noon, counting \"returns.\" These are the unsold papers that show a failing market. His society manages 55 distribution centres across Dhaka. \"In the past, the city corporation set up nearly 100 stalls\", Zakir says. \"They were usually near bus stops. But as the city grew, many were destroyed. Some were removed for the Metro Rail. Now, only 25 to 30 are still standing.\" Hawkers get 40% commission After finishing their morning deliveries to homes and offices, some hawkers set up temporary stands in busy areas. There are about 50 of these. But the amount is very low. A hawker usually earns a 40% commission on each paper. The society takes a very small cut of Tk0.50 to Tk1. Zakir joined the trade in the mid-90s. He remembers his brother's library in their home village. It was the centre of the community because it had national newspapers. People spent all day there just to read. \"That world is gone,\" Zakir says sadly. \"The decline started with mobile phones. But the pandemic was the final blow. A rumour spread that newspapers could carry the virus. Many regular readers stopped buying them. They never started again.\" He explains the change simply: \"Young people do not touch paper. They get news instantly on their phones. Everyone is a journalist now. Only the elderly still read out of habit. Every time an old person passes away, we lose a reader. Our market is dying of old age.\" However, something unusual happened during the July Uprising of 2024. When the internet was shut down, the city turned back to the hawkers. People stood in lines at stalls to buy papers. They needed to know what was happening in their own streets – a short reminder of how important the press used to be. Aliraj and the Shahbagh stall Many remember the two temporary stalls beneath Bangladesh Medical University (PG Hospital) in Shahbagh. Today, only the one beside Popular Pharmacy remains. It was once a famous meeting place for writers and poets like Humayun Azad. In the 80s and 90s, papers like Ittefaq and Janakantha were in massive demand. Periodicals ranged from political journals like Bichinta and Ajker Surjo Uday to entertainment magazines like Ananda Bichitra, Tarakalok, and Chitralok, health publications like Apnar Shasthya and Prescription, and women's magazines including Begum and Onnya. Niche magazines on computers, sports, and crime also had significant readership. Shahbagh became a magnet for readers; passersby would spend hours simply observing the stacks of newspapers. Today, the man running this spot is Aliraj. He still keeps a few newspapers, but they are tucked away or hanging in the back. His main business has shifted. He now sells bags, office files, and children's school books. \"Cars would wait in line just to grab a paper from me. I used to go home with Tk6,000-5,000 in profit. Now, some days I can't even buy groceries. Before, I hated it when people stood and read for free. Now, I am just happy if anyone stops to look,\" Aliraj says. Newspapers were in the skies In Paribagh, opposite Hotel InterContinental, Jasim Molla runs a small stall, delivering just 30 newspapers daily – down from 300 in the past. Once, he also sold international magazines like The Times and National Geographic. Some airlines were regular clients of Dhaka's newspapers. According to Zakir, the BFCC (Bangladesh Flight Catering Centre) supplied newspapers for domestic and international flights. Staff would start work before sunrise, distributing newspapers until 10am. Hawkers have witnessed history unfold: Ershad's fall, the Gulf War, the caretaker government, the 1991 election, the death of Salman Shah, the Twin Tower attack, the execution of Ershad's associates, the deaths of actors Manna and footballer Monem Munna, and the rise of Formula Minus Two. At that time, \"Telegrams\" (extra editions) were printed in an hour. Hawkers would jump on buses, shouting the headlines to a hungry public. Once respected, now struggling In Mirpur 11, Syed Abu Naser is struggling to keep his father's stall open. He left his college studies to take over the business when his father fell ill. \"I used to sell 200 copies of \"Rahasya\" magazine alone,\" Naser says. Now, his stall is filled with gloves, socks, and pens. \"Some days, I don't sell a single paper. I keep them only to honour my father's memory. But the truth is, every newspaper I stock is a financial loss.\" Zakir Hossain echoes the sentiment: \"Our future is uncertain. When times were good, we did more than business, we provided news and earned respect. We worry about tomorrow more than anything else.\" Dhaka's paper hawkers once chronicled the city for thousands of readers. With readership declining and digital media on the rise, their world is shrinking. They deliver yesterday's news to a world that has already moved on. newspaper / stall / hawker", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/features/news-stands-without-newspapers-what-dhakas-hawkers-now-sell-survive-1341571", "date": "2026-01-23T10:55:00+06:00", "author": "Saleh Shafique 23 January, 2026, 10:55 am Last modified: 23 January, 2026, 12:12 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1037, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:35:28.422963"}

It will be renamed after another nearby street, Glinkastrasse, named after 19th century Russian composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka. BVG said on Friday it would change the station name, amid a worldwide reckoning with buried legacies of racism and colonial crimes underpinning many western societies, sparked by the death in the United States of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a police officer. The station lies a few hundred metres from the Brandenburg Gate at the very centre of Berlin, and has had a string of names since it was opened in 1908. \"We will change all network plans, signs at the stations and on buses. Everything must be changed on the subways,\" said Rolf Erfurt, a BVG board member, in an interview with Reuters TV. \"We will have completed that by the end of the year,\" he said. Last month, unidentified activists taped over the station's entrance, temporarily naming it \"George Floyd Street\". \"I think it's fantastic (to rename the station) because I think it is not on in the 21st century to name streets after racist insults against Black people,\" said Akwasi Osei-Dwomoh, a passer-by. \"I wish that not just the metro station, but also the street itself, will find a better name.\" Berlin / Germany / #BlackLivesMatter / Black Lives Matter movement / Metro Station / Mohrenstrasse", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/world/berlin-metro-complete-change-derogatory-station-name-year-end-101845", "date": "2020-07-04T21:45:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 04 July, 2020, 09:45 pm Last modified: 04 July, 2020, 09:57 pm", "category": "world", "language": "en", "token_count": 275, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:35:30.508691"}

{"title": "Push for loans to tourism under stimulus package", "body": "Speakers at an online conference urged the government to provide loans to tourism stakeholders, such as tour operators, travel agents, hoteliers and aviation owners, under the stimulus package to help the sector heal injuries caused by the pandemic. Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and travel magazine \"Vromon\" jointly organised the conference titled \"Elephant Theory and Window Dressing Method in Tourism: Key Tool for Recovery against Post-Covid-19\". It was part of a conference series titled \"Tourism: A Penalty Shoot for the Economy of Bangladesh-7\". Md Rafeuzzaman, president of the Tour Operators Association of Bangladesh, said tour operators, travel agents and other stakeholders in the sector have been highly affected by the Covid-19. \"However, we are not getting bank loans under the government-declared stimulus package.\" He also said tourism is eligible to get loans as a service sector. \"However, banks are refusing most of the travel agents and tour operators to give them loans.\" Md Mohibul Haque, senior secretary of the civil aviation and tourism ministry, urged tour operators to submit necessary documents of foreign currency earning to banks so that they can get the loan under the stimulus package. \"Tour operators, guides and other stakeholders are not legally recognised in the country as there is no tourism law. We are working on a law which is now in the law ministry for vetting.\" He mentioned that the standard operational manual is ready to reopen the tourism sector amid the pandemic. \"We will send it to all stakeholders concerned within this month.\" Tourism is the most affected sector amid the pandemic, he said, adding that a dozen ministries are interrelated with the sector but they do not have adequate coordination. Mohibul Haque also said private airlines are facing the highest level of hardship now. \"It is really tough for them to survive the pandemic. We are considering the waiver of aeronautical charge of private airlines but they have to follow our guidelines.\" He urged the media to play a constructive role to promote a good image of Bangladesh all over the world. Meanwhile, the secretary said the government is working on making the country's first-ever heliport. \"A suitable place has been selected for this purpose. In this regard, the civil aviation authority has formed a committee which will prepare a report very soon.

{"title": "Crest Securities’ clients claim Tk16 crore-plus in cash", "body": "Three dozen clients of Crest Securities have claimed to the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) that the defaulting brokerage firm owes them over Tk16 crore. Responding to the DSE invitation for claims, 52 investors claimed ownership of shares while at least a dozen claimed both shares and cash in their investment accounts in the firm until last week. However, the numbers and figures are merely claims and the updates were presented to the DSE board on July 2. There might be more claims as all the clients are yet to respond. The exchange will check the claims this week while inspecting and investigating the back office system of the brokerage firm, said the DSE officials. One of them told The Business Standard that the DSE will deal with the claims of the brokerage clients only. The loan providers will have to take care of their claims themselves. Crest Securities – eighth member house of the DSE – failed in settlements in the last week of June. Then the exchange immediately froze its accounts and assets so that clients' claims can be settled with the belongings. In an online press conference last week, the DSE Managing Director Kazi Sanaul Hoq said the brokerage firm's clients have securities worth Tk82 crore in the electronic depository system of the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited. The firm has over 20,000 clients. The owners of the frozen securities will get the opportunity to transfer them to a new beneficiary account through the linking facility approved by the exchange and the regulator. Cash balance of clients is likely to be paid from frozen assets – like the DSE membership and brokerage licence of the firm – as the brokerage firm has a very little cash in its bank accounts. But the broker's main asset within the exchange company – shares of the DSE Limited – had already been mortgaged in the Social Islami Bank Ltd against the loans taken by the brokerage house owners. However, the DSE managing director told the media last week that no bank would be able to get the DSE shares and those would be under DSE management's control so that it can sell those, if needed, to settle clients' claims. Directors of Crest Securities went into hiding since the news of their inability to settle claims had broken out. The exchange, based on orders from the securities regulator, immediately wrote to the law enforcement agencies to find them and not to allow them to leave the country. Brokerage firms are now in a tight corner due to the depressed condition of the capital market and some of them are allegedly mishandling client assets. The DSE has asked each of its brokerage firms to submit their own consolidated accounts. This might help the exchange to learn about the broader health of the firms only as the exchange is unable to check every single transaction of the brokers' clients. The exchanges do not get to know anything until the clients complain about the misconduct of their broker. For effective regulatory monitoring, there needs to be real-time access to the brokers' back office and bank details, a Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) official suggested. After the Crest Securities case, both the securities regulator and the exchange stepped up their efforts to inspect brokerage houses. The Business Standard has learned at least eight brokerage firms were identified to mishandle client assets to some extent. Previously Don Securities and Shah Mohammad Sagir & Co at the DSE, and Sylhet Metro City – a member house of the Chittagong Stock Exchange – embezzled the clients' assets in investment accounts. In each of the cases, the exchanges – guided by the BSEC – tried to confiscate brokers' assets and encash those to settle clients' claims. When the claims surpass a broker's assets, the regulatory system has a provision to pay the clients from the investors' protection fund at the exchanges. Alongside strong regulatory supervision and monitoring, the exchange needs to effectively strengthen the fund, the BSEC officials suggested.

{"title": "Tenants of the weeping wood: Life and labour of Bandarban rubber garden workers", "body": "Thowai Sa Mong Marma, a 50-year-old rubber garden worker, begins his day before 4 am, long before the sun appears. On a stone-cold, foggy winter morning, carrying a torch and an iron blade, he rides his bicycle to the rubber garden, crossing narrow, bumpy hill roads. He stops at the specific plot assigned to him. Then, with skilled hands, he makes a precise, shallow, diagonal incision in the bark — carefully calculated to sever the latex vessels without damaging the cambium. Almost instantly, milky white latex bleeds from the wound, dripping slowly into collection cups. \"To get the maximum yield, we need to cut the tree early in the morning,\" he said with a smile. This solitary labour is only the first half of the shift. By 10 am, the morning mist has lifted, and Thowai returns to the garden, this time accompanied by his wife. They carry buckets, funnels, and gallon containers. Together, they collect the liquor, emptying the cups that have gradually filled over the past few hours. With buckets and gallons full, they head back home. The same routine is followed everyday by at least one member of almost every family in Kibuk Para, a village in Kuhalong Union of Bandarban Sadar Upazila. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Thowai's routine offers a microscopic view of a vast industry. According to a report titled \"Current Situation and Export Potential of Bangladesh's Rubber Industry\" by the Bangladesh Tariff and Trade Commission (BTTC), rubber is cultivated across 147,333 acres nationwide. The country produces approximately 70,357 metric tonnes each year. Of this total, the Bangladesh Forest Industry Development Corporation (BFIDC) oversees the production of 5,522.20 metric tonnes from 38,067.01 acres. The second-largest contributor is the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB), which produces 1,150 metric tonnes from 1,200 acres spread across Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagrachhari. A rubber tree is tapped with precision, producing milky latex that drips into collection cups. Photo: TBS However, these production figures come with a heavy environmental price tag. Vast areas of rubber gardens in the Lama, Naikhongchhari, Bandarban Sadar, and Alikadam upazilas of Bandarban district, largely under private ownership, have triggered a severe ecological crisis in the hills. According to district administration sources cited in a report titled \"Rubber: A Death Sentence to Natural Forests\", published on 1 March 2024 by the Brattyajan Resource Centre, approximately 45,000 acres of public land in the district have been leased for commercial rubber cultivation and horticulture. These plantations are monoculture—nothing else grows on their floors. They may look green from a distance, but they are actually green deserts, devoid of wildlife. Philip Gain As journalist and researcher Philip Gain notes in the report, \"These plantations are monoculture — nothing else grows on their floors. They may look green from a distance, but they are actually green deserts, devoid of wildlife. When the leaves fall between January and March, the trees look completely burnt and barren. This is the exact opposite of a natural forest.\" Thowai Sa Mong Marma has been working in one of these CHTDB-operated gardens for decades, but the story of how his community came to rely on these trees is rooted in a longer history of displacement and political change. Thowai's elder brother, Thowai Nu Mong Marma, who also manages several garden plots, recalled a time before the rubber trees. \"Like other Indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, we used to practise jum cultivation,\" his elder brother explained, leaning back as he reflects on the transition. \"It was our tradition, and many people depended on it. But jum cultivation is a very tough process. It requires a lot of hard work.\" He described a system of migratory farming in which land had to be left fallow for two to four years after a single harvest to restore its fertility. This necessity forced families to move from hill to hill, leading to a transient way of life. The shift from diverse jum farming to rubber cultivation has been deeply controversial. As Philip Gain pointed out, \"Rubber has not just been successful in the CHT; it has caused massive ecological damage and harm to Indigenous communities.\" \"It has been a factor behind the eviction of many Indigenous people from their customary land, traditionally used for jum cultivation and the production of other crops. Rubber plantations do not bode well for nature, given their ecological impacts on local communities, particularly ethnic minority groups.\" The move towards sedentary rubber farming was not an organic transition; it was part of a state-sponsored reconfiguration of the hills during the regime of President Ziaur Rahman. \"During President Ziaur Rahman's time, as you know, he took many initiatives in this region,\" the elder brother continued. \"Alongside bringing settlers here, he also initiated rehabilitation programmes for Indigenous people.\" In the Bandarban and Rangamati areas, ten distinct paras (villages) were selected under this initiative. In each village, fifty families were identified for rehabilitation and reintegration into a settled agrarian lifestyle. The government's promise was substantial: each family was meant to receive five acres and twenty-five decimals of land. Of this, 25 decimals were allocated for a homestead, one acre for a surrounding garden, and a significant four-acre plot for rubber cultivation. Photo: TBS The reality on the ground, however, fell well short of the blueprint. \"We only got one acre and 25 decimals of land in our name — the house and the surrounding area. The rubber garden land is government-owned; it is not registered in our name.\" Despite the lack of ownership, each rehabilitated family was assigned responsibility for a specific plot of government-owned rubber trees. They act as caretakers and harvesters, tapping the latex and selling it back to government-run collection centres. Overseeing this supply chain in the villages of Bandarban is Chaing Swe Mong Marma. He serves as a bridge between the muddy reality of the gardens and the bureaucratic structure of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB). According to Chaing, the initiative dates back to the late 1980s, when the Development Board first planted the saplings. \"From the beginning, they signed a contract with the cultivators,\" Chaing explained. \"Under this arrangement, 40% of the rubber's price is taken by the government, while 60% goes to the cultivators. The association also maintains the garden.\" For instance, if the market price of rubber stands at Tk200 per kilogram, Tk80 is retained by the government for processing and maintenance, while Tk120 goes to the worker. Almost every family depends on this system. While locals also engage in small-scale cultivation of pineapple, mango, and rabi crops, rubber provides a steady—if fluctuating—source of cash income. Over time, people have adjusted their biological clocks to the trees, waking before dawn to tap the winter sap flow. As Chaing explained, the system under the CHTDB is overseen by a committee comprising the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Development Board, two members from Bandarban, several from Rangamati, and the District Commissioners of the hill districts. Chaing Swe Mong takes pride in the transparency he has worked to establish over his eight years of oversight. \"Before, this was regulated from the central office, and workers did not receive fair payment,\" he said. \"I protested against that repeatedly and eventually managed to set up an accounts section here, so the money stays here.\" Now, Chaing regulates payments on a monthly basis, calculated according to individual production. To enter the system, a worker must have a family; plots are registered to households rather than individuals. When a young man or woman starts a family, they become eligible to apply for a plot. The collection centre itself operates on precise measurement. At present, workers are paid Tk90 for liquid latex. A meter at the factory measures the rubber-to-water ratio in the liquor to ensure fair payment. The centre also buys kablang—the scrap rubber that hardens on the collection cup or drips down after the main harvest. As kablang cannot be processed into high-quality rubber sheets and requires different handling, it commands a lower price, typically between Tk70 and Tk80 per kilogram. Yet when the arithmetic of the 60–40 split is translated into monthly household income, the picture is far less reassuring. Asked for a rough estimate, workers agree that a family earns around Tk15,000 a month from the garden. For most, this is simply not enough to sustain a household. This economic pressure forces workers like Sho Kya Singh to divide their days into multiple shifts of labour. Sho Kya Singh is a rubber garden worker, but when he sets down the collection buckets, he does not rest. He drives a CNG auto-rickshaw and takes on part-time manual labour to make ends meet. He represents a significant segment of the hill tracts workforce, where people overwork their bodies because the system cannot support them adequately. There is, however, another divide — between those who depend solely on government-assigned plots and those who, alongside these plots, have managed to cultivate private gardens. Thowai Sa Mong Marma belongs to the latter group, placing him in a slightly more secure economic position. In his backyard, he has set up a small-scale processing unit. He and his wife work together using a strainer machine, moulding their own rubber and pressing the liquor into sheets. By adding value to the raw product before selling it, they secure a modestly higher margin than those who sell liquid latex alone. A rubber tree is an investment in time. It requires eight years of care after planting before it produces a single drop of commercially viable latex. Once tapping begins, the tree has a productive window of around 25 years. By the time it reaches the age of 32 or 33, its economic life cycle is effectively over. Yields drop, the bark becomes exhausted, and the tree must be felled. The trees in Kibuk Para, planted in the early 1990s, are staring down the barrel of this expiration date. They are still producing enough latex to keep the village economy turning, but within five years, they are likely to go dry. This impending deadline brings the issue of land ownership sharply back into focus. Chaing Swe Marma admits, \"We don't know what will happen then. Of course, the trees will be cut down, and maybe they will replant rubber trees. If only the government wants, we can get to work again. Since these plots are still not in our name, we cannot say what will be farmed here.\" The fear is tangible: if the government decides to shift priorities or change land use after the trees are felled, the families could be left with nothing — no trees, no land, no income. Abu Shahed Chowdhury, the General Secretary of the Rubber Board, attempts to allay these fears regarding the continuity of the gardens. He explained that the end of a tree's lifecycle does not necessarily mean the land will be abandoned. \"It's not that after cutting down a tree, the land is left barren,\" Chowdhury said. \"New trees are planted in between. We don't cut down all the trees at once, since they are planted in different cycles and at different times. So the garden is never without trees.\" Critics, however, argue that this cycle permanently alters the landscape. Rubber — whether in the CHT, Madhupur, or the tea gardens — may bring economic benefits to the state and private entrepreneurs, but it has generally failed to benefit the people who once relied on these lands. Worse, wherever rubber trees have been planted, they have depleted the soil and other natural resources. Photo: TBS Despite these environmental warnings, the industry remains focused on production. Chowdhury, however, acknowledges that the rubber sector in the hills is suffering from technological stagnation. The biological infrastructure of the gardens is outdated. \"The clone we plant here is RRIM 600, which is really old,\" he noted. \"In Malaysia or Sri Lanka, they use RRIM 1000 or RRIM 2000, which are high-yielding and can be tapped much earlier. We are trying to introduce some of those clones to our country and test whether they suit our conditions.\" The introduction of modern clones could potentially revolutionise yields, but it cannot resolve the immediate problem of market volatility. The price of rubber in Bangladesh has been on a consistent downward trajectory, squeezing margins for everyone — from the CHTDB to the rubber garden workers. On this constant price drop, Chowdhury admits, \"It's true that the price has been falling day by day, but we don't really know why. And there is no fixed price — whoever can sell, does so.\" He attributed part of the problem to the infancy of regulatory institutions. \"As a comparatively new institute, we don't yet have the power or capacity to set prices or regulate imports and exports. We are still working on that.\" On a stone-cold, foggy winter morning, carrying a torch and an iron blade, he rides his bicycle to the rubber garden, crossing narrow, bumpy hill roads. He stops at the specific plot assigned to him. Then, with skilled hands, he makes a precise, shallow, diagonal incision in the bark — carefully calculated to sever the latex vessels without damaging the cambium. Almost instantly, milky white latex bleeds from the wound, dripping slowly into collection cups. \"To get the maximum yield, we need to cut the tree early in the morning,\" he said with a smile. This solitary labour is only the first half of the shift. By 10 am, the morning mist has lifted, and Thowai returns to the garden, this time accompanied by his wife. They carry buckets, funnels, and gallon containers. Together, they collect the liquor, emptying the cups that have gradually filled over the past few hours. With buckets and gallons full, they head back home. The same routine is followed everyday by at least one member of almost every family in Kibuk Para, a village in Kuhalong Union of Bandarban Sadar Upazila. Thowai's routine offers a microscopic view of a vast industry. According to a report titled \"Current Situation and Export Potential of Bangladesh's Rubber Industry\" by the Bangladesh Tariff and Trade Commission (BTTC), rubber is cultivated across 147,333 acres nationwide. The country produces approximately 70,357 metric tonnes each year. Of this total, the Bangladesh Forest Industry Development Corporation (BFIDC) oversees the production of 5,522.20 metric tonnes from 38,067.01 acres. The second-largest contributor is the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB), which produces 1,150 metric tonnes from 1,200 acres spread across Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagrachhari. However, these production figures come with a heavy environmental price tag. Vast areas of rubber gardens in the Lama, Naikhongchhari, Bandarban Sadar, and Alikadam upazilas of Bandarban district, largely under private ownership, have triggered a severe ecological crisis in the hills. According to district administration sources cited in a report titled \"Rubber: A Death Sentence to Natural Forests\", published on 1 March 2024 by the Brattyajan Resource Centre, approximately 45,000 acres of public land in the district have been leased for commercial rubber cultivation and horticulture. These plantations are monoculture—nothing else grows on their floors. They may look green from a distance, but they are actually green deserts, devoid of wildlife. Philip Gain As journalist and researcher Philip Gain notes in the report, \"These plantations are monoculture — nothing else grows on their floors. They may look green from a distance, but they are actually green deserts, devoid of wildlife. When the leaves fall between January and March, the trees look completely burnt and barren. This is the exact opposite of a natural forest.\" Thowai Sa Mong Marma has been working in one of these CHTDB-operated gardens for decades, but the story of how his community came to rely on these trees is rooted in a longer history of displacement and political change. Thowai's elder brother, Thowai Nu Mong Marma, who also manages several garden plots, recalled a time before the rubber trees. \"Like other Indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, we used to practise jum cultivation,\" his elder brother explained, leaning back as he reflects on the transition. \"It was our tradition, and many people depended on it. But jum cultivation is a very tough process. It requires a lot of hard work.\" He described a system of migratory farming in which land had to be left fallow for two to four years after a single harvest to restore its fertility. This necessity forced families to move from hill to hill, leading to a transient way of life. The shift from diverse jum farming to rubber cultivation has been deeply controversial. As Philip Gain pointed out, \"Rubber has not just been successful in the CHT; it has caused massive ecological damage and harm to Indigenous communities.\" \"It has been a factor behind the eviction of many Indigenous people from their customary land, traditionally used for jum cultivation and the production of other crops. Rubber plantations do not bode well for nature, given their ecological impacts on local communities, particularly ethnic minority groups.\" The move towards sedentary rubber farming was not an organic transition; it was part of a state-sponsored reconfiguration of the hills during the regime of President Ziaur Rahman. \"During President Ziaur Rahman's time, as you know, he took many initiatives in this region,\" the elder brother continued. \"Alongside bringing settlers here, he also initiated rehabilitation programmes for Indigenous people.\" In the Bandarban and Rangamati areas, ten distinct paras (villages) were selected under this initiative. In each village, fifty families were identified for rehabilitation and reintegration into a settled agrarian lifestyle. The government's promise was substantial: each family was meant to receive five acres and twenty-five decimals of land. Of this, 25 decimals were allocated for a homestead, one acre for a surrounding garden, and a significant four-acre plot for rubber cultivation. Photo: TBS The reality on the ground, however, fell well short of the blueprint. \"We only got one acre and 25 decimals of land in our name — the house and the surrounding area. The rubber garden land is government-owned; it is not registered in our name.\" Despite the lack of ownership, each rehabilitated family was assigned responsibility for a specific plot of government-owned rubber trees. They act as caretakers and harvesters, tapping the latex and selling it back to government-run collection centres. Overseeing this supply chain in the villages of Bandarban is Chaing Swe Mong Marma. He serves as a bridge between the muddy reality of the gardens and the bureaucratic structure of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB). According to Chaing, the initiative dates back to the late 1980s, when the Development Board first planted the saplings. \"From the beginning, they signed a contract with the cultivators,\" Chaing explained. \"Under this arrangement, 40% of the rubber's price is taken by the government, while 60% goes to the cultivators. The association also maintains the garden.\" For instance, if the market price of rubber stands at Tk200 per kilogram, Tk80 is retained by the government for processing and maintenance, while Tk120 goes to the worker. Almost every family depends on this system. While locals also engage in small-scale cultivation of pineapple, mango, and rabi crops, rubber provides a steady—if fluctuating—source of cash income. Over time, people have adjusted their biological clocks to the trees, waking before dawn to tap the winter sap flow. As Chaing explained, the system under the CHTDB is overseen by a committee comprising the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Development Board, two members from Bandarban, several from Rangamati, and the District Commissioners of the hill districts. Chaing Swe Mong takes pride in the transparency he has worked to establish over his eight years of oversight. \"Before, this was regulated from the central office, and workers did not receive fair payment,\" he said. \"I protested against that repeatedly and eventually managed to set up an accounts section here, so the money stays here.\" Now, Chaing regulates payments on a monthly basis, calculated according to individual production. To enter the system, a worker must have a family; plots are registered to households rather than individuals. When a young man or woman starts a family, they become eligible to apply for a plot. The collection centre itself operates on precise measurement. At present, workers are paid Tk90 for liquid latex. A meter at the factory measures the rubber-to-water ratio in the liquor to ensure fair payment. The centre also buys kablang—the scrap rubber that hardens on the collection cup or drips down after the main harvest. As kablang cannot be processed into high-quality rubber sheets and requires different handling, it commands a lower price, typically between Tk70 and Tk80 per kilogram. Yet when the arithmetic of the 60–40 split is translated into monthly household income, the picture is far less reassuring. Asked for a rough estimate, workers agree that a family earns around Tk15,000 a month from the garden. For most, this is simply not enough to sustain a household. This economic pressure forces workers like Sho Kya Singh to divide their days into multiple shifts of labour. Sho Kya Singh is a rubber garden worker, but when he sets down the collection buckets, he does not rest. He drives a CNG auto-rickshaw and takes on part-time manual labour to make ends meet. He represents a significant segment of the hill tracts workforce, where people overwork their bodies because the system cannot support them adequately. There is, however, another divide — between those who depend solely on government-assigned plots and those who, alongside these plots, have managed to cultivate private gardens. Thowai Sa Mong Marma belongs to the latter group, placing him in a slightly more secure economic position. In his backyard, he has set up a small-scale processing unit. He and his wife work together using a strainer machine, moulding their own rubber and pressing the liquor into sheets. By adding value to the raw product before selling it, they secure a modestly higher margin than those who sell liquid latex alone. A rubber tree is an investment in time. It requires eight years of care after planting before it produces a single drop of commercially viable latex. Once tapping begins, the tree has a productive window of around 25 years. By the time it reaches the age of 32 or 33, its economic life cycle is effectively over. Yields drop, the bark becomes exhausted, and the tree must be felled. The trees in Kibuk Para, planted in the early 1990s, are staring down the barrel of this expiration date. They are still producing enough latex to keep the village economy turning, but within five years, they are likely to go dry. This impending deadline brings the issue of land ownership sharply back into focus. Chaing Swe Marma admits, \"We don't know what will happen then. Of course, the trees will be cut down, and maybe they will replant rubber trees. If only the government wants, we can get to work again. Since these plots are still not in our name, we cannot say what will be farmed here.\" The fear is tangible: if the government decides to shift priorities or change land use after the trees are felled, the families could be left with nothing — no trees, no land, no income.

As Philip Gain pointed out, \"Rubber has not just been successful in the CHT; it has caused massive ecological damage and harm to Indigenous communities.\" \"It has been a factor behind the eviction of many Indigenous people from their customary land, traditionally used for jum cultivation and the production of other crops. Rubber plantations do not bode well for nature, given their ecological impacts on local communities, particularly ethnic minority groups.\" The move towards sedentary rubber farming was not an organic transition; it was part of a state-sponsored reconfiguration of the hills during the regime of President Ziaur Rahman. \"During President Ziaur Rahman's time, as you know, he took many initiatives in this region,\" the elder brother continued. \"Alongside bringing settlers here, he also initiated rehabilitation programmes for Indigenous people.\" In the Bandarban and Rangamati areas, ten distinct paras (villages) were selected under this initiative. In each village, fifty families were identified for rehabilitation and reintegration into a settled agrarian lifestyle. The government's promise was substantial: each family was meant to receive five acres and twenty-five decimals of land. Of this, 25 decimals were allocated for a homestead, one acre for a surrounding garden, and a significant four-acre plot for rubber cultivation. The reality on the ground, however, fell well short of the blueprint. \"We only got one acre and 25 decimals of land in our name — the house and the surrounding area. The rubber garden land is government-owned; it is not registered in our name.\" Despite the lack of ownership, each rehabilitated family was assigned responsibility for a specific plot of government-owned rubber trees. They act as caretakers and harvesters, tapping the latex and selling it back to government-run collection centres. Overseeing this supply chain in the villages of Bandarban is Chaing Swe Mong Marma. He serves as a bridge between the muddy reality of the gardens and the bureaucratic structure of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board (CHTDB). According to Chaing, the initiative dates back to the late 1980s, when the Development Board first planted the saplings. \"From the beginning, they signed a contract with the cultivators,\" Chaing explained. \"Under this arrangement, 40% of the rubber's price is taken by the government, while 60% goes to the cultivators. The association also maintains the garden.\" For instance, if the market price of rubber stands at Tk200 per kilogram, Tk80 is retained by the government for processing and maintenance, while Tk120 goes to the worker. Almost every family depends on this system. While locals also engage in small-scale cultivation of pineapple, mango, and rabi crops, rubber provides a steady—if fluctuating—source of cash income. Over time, people have adjusted their biological clocks to the trees, waking before dawn to tap the winter sap flow. As Chaing explained, the system under the CHTDB is overseen by a committee comprising the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Development Board, two members from Bandarban, several from Rangamati, and the District Commissioners of the hill districts. Chaing Swe Mong takes pride in the transparency he has worked to establish over his eight years of oversight. \"Before, this was regulated from the central office, and workers did not receive fair payment,\" he said. \"I protested against that repeatedly and eventually managed to set up an accounts section here, so the money stays here.\" Now, Chaing regulates payments on a monthly basis, calculated according to individual production. To enter the system, a worker must have a family; plots are registered to households rather than individuals. When a young man or woman starts a family, they become eligible to apply for a plot. The collection centre itself operates on precise measurement. At present, workers are paid Tk90 for liquid latex. A meter at the factory measures the rubber-to-water ratio in the liquor to ensure fair payment. The centre also buys kablang—the scrap rubber that hardens on the collection cup or drips down after the main harvest. As kablang cannot be processed into high-quality rubber sheets and requires different handling, it commands a lower price, typically between Tk70 and Tk80 per kilogram. Yet when the arithmetic of the 60–40 split is translated into monthly household income, the picture is far less reassuring. Asked for a rough estimate, workers agree that a family earns around Tk15,000 a month from the garden. For most, this is simply not enough to sustain a household. This economic pressure forces workers like Sho Kya Singh to divide their days into multiple shifts of labour. Sho Kya Singh is a rubber garden worker, but when he sets down the collection buckets, he does not rest. He drives a CNG auto-rickshaw and takes on part-time manual labour to make ends meet. He represents a significant segment of the hill tracts workforce, where people overwork their bodies because the system cannot support them adequately. There is, however, another divide — between those who depend solely on government-assigned plots and those who, alongside these plots, have managed to cultivate private gardens. Thowai Sa Mong Marma belongs to the latter group, placing him in a slightly more secure economic position. In his backyard, he has set up a small-scale processing unit. He and his wife work together using a strainer machine, moulding their own rubber and pressing the liquor into sheets. By adding value to the raw product before selling it, they secure a modestly higher margin than those who sell liquid latex alone. A rubber tree is an investment in time. It requires eight years of care after planting before it produces a single drop of commercially viable latex. Once tapping begins, the tree has a productive window of around 25 years. By the time it reaches the age of 32 or 33, its economic life cycle is effectively over. Yields drop, the bark becomes exhausted, and the tree must be felled. The trees in Kibuk Para, planted in the early 1990s, are staring down the barrel of this expiration date. They are still producing enough latex to keep the village economy turning, but within five years, they are likely to go dry. This impending deadline brings the issue of land ownership sharply back into focus. Chaing Swe Marma admits, \"We don't know what will happen then. Of course, the trees will be cut down, and maybe they will replant rubber trees. If only the government wants, we can get to work again. Since these plots are still not in our name, we cannot say what will be farmed here.\" The fear is tangible: if the government decides to shift priorities or change land use after the trees are felled, the families could be left with nothing — no trees, no land, no income. Abu Shahed Chowdhury, the General Secretary of the Rubber Board, attempts to allay these fears regarding the continuity of the gardens. He explained that the end of a tree's lifecycle does not necessarily mean the land will be abandoned. \"It's not that after cutting down a tree, the land is left barren,\" Chowdhury said. \"New trees are planted in between. We don't cut down all the trees at once, since they are planted in different cycles and at different times. So the garden is never without trees.\" Critics, however, argue that this cycle permanently alters the landscape. Rubber — whether in the CHT, Madhupur, or the tea gardens — may bring economic benefits to the state and private entrepreneurs, but it has generally failed to benefit the people who once relied on these lands. Worse, wherever rubber trees have been planted, they have depleted the soil and other natural resources. Photo: TBS Despite these environmental warnings, the industry remains focused on production. Chowdhury, however, acknowledges that the rubber sector in the hills is suffering from technological stagnation. The biological infrastructure of the gardens is outdated. \"The clone we plant here is RRIM 600, which is really old,\" he noted. \"In Malaysia or Sri Lanka, they use RRIM 1000 or RRIM 2000, which are high-yielding and can be tapped much earlier. We are trying to introduce some of those clones to our country and test whether they suit our conditions.\" The introduction of modern clones could potentially revolutionise yields, but it cannot resolve the immediate problem of market volatility. The price of rubber in Bangladesh has been on a consistent downward trajectory, squeezing margins for everyone — from the CHTDB to the rubber garden workers. On this constant price drop, Chowdhury admits, \"It's true that the price has been falling day by day, but we don't really know why. And there is no fixed price — whoever can sell, does so.\" He attributed part of the problem to the infancy of regulatory institutions. \"As a comparatively new institute, we don't yet have the power or capacity to set prices or regulate imports and exports. We are still working on that.\" Despite the lack of ownership, each rehabilitated family was assigned responsibility for a specific plot of government-owned rubber trees.

{"title": "Rebuilding lives under injury: The vacuum in Bangladesh’s rehabilitation sector", "body": "The healthcare system of Bangladesh has made substantial progress in recent years. However, one critical area remains shockingly neglected: rehabilitation. For vulnerable patients recovering from accidents, physical trauma, orthopaedic injuries, and strokes, physiotherapy is essential to restoring independence. It plays a vital role in maintaining quality of life, particularly for patients who require lifelong physiotherapy. Nevertheless, in Bangladesh this sector remains severely underdeveloped. There is a lack of consistency in treatment standards, inadequate professional regulation, and limited access to trained professionals. As a result, patients are often exposed to negligence, prolonged suffering, and debilitating pain. Consider the case of a patient undergoing rehabilitation following a spinal injury. In the absence of a meticulously planned rehabilitation programme and methodical physiotherapy, recovery is frequently delayed, incomplete, or even harmful. Although physiotherapy is formally recognised as a medical discipline, Bangladesh lacks a dedicated licensing authority. Oversight mechanisms, such as the National Rehabilitation Council under the Ministry of Social Welfare, remain largely non-functional. Civil and legal remedies addressing malpractice are inadequate, and professional accountability is weak. Relevant legislation includes the Civil Procedure Code 1908, the Penal Code 1860 (Sections 304A and 336), the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council Act 2010, and the Consumer Rights Protection Act 2009. Despite these legal frameworks, regulatory enforcement in physiotherapy remains ineffective. These failures are not merely legal or structural shortcomings; they directly affect the lives of real people on a daily basis. Vulnerable patients endure slow recovery, chronic pain, and loss of independence. The consequences extend to families, who bear both social and economic burdens, while public confidence in the healthcare system erodes due to the absence of standardised treatment and reliable outcomes. Access to effective rehabilitation is not only a health concern; it is fundamentally about restoring dignity, ensuring social inclusion, and expanding economic opportunities. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Access to effective rehabilitation is not only a health concern; it is fundamentally about restoring dignity, ensuring social inclusion, and expanding economic opportunities. Patients who receive effective physiotherapy and multidisciplinary care are far more likely to regain confidence, restore independence, and return to work promptly, contributing productively to society. Conversely, delayed or ineffective rehabilitation restricts mobility, undermines employability, and increases social isolation. Global experience offers valuable guidance for reform. In the United Kingdom, physiotherapists are licensed by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), which enforces rigorous professional standards and safeguards patient welfare. Bangladesh must also adopt a multidisciplinary approach that integrates physiotherapists, physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, and other specialists to ensure optimal rehabilitation outcomes. Comparable regulatory oversight and civil liability frameworks exist in the United States and Canada, where patient safety and professional standards are upheld through well-established mechanisms. Landmark cases such as Walker v Segura Jr (USA) and Athey v Leonati (Canada) demonstrate how strict compliance with clinical protocols and robust accountability significantly reduce malpractice risks. Bangladesh should incorporate these international models by establishing a specialised Physiotherapy Council under the Ministry of Health. Such a body would oversee licensing, formulate clinical practice guidelines, and enforce professional accountability. Equally important is the promotion of coordinated, team-based care involving specialists from multiple disciplines, particularly for complex cases. Healthcare institutions must implement standardised, evidence-based treatment protocols to ensure consistency and quality of care. When coupled with a strong civil liability framework, these measures would protect patient rights and elevate professional standards.

{"title": "CVASU researchers invent coronavirus-resistant fabric", "body": "The vaccine of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is yet to be discovered. But a team of researchers at Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) has invented a fabric that can resist the virus. The invention of the special fabric will help keep the wheel of the economy moving and also will provide protection to everyone. The coronavirus-resistant fabric and health care products will jointly be marketed by a local commercial company and a Switzerland-based firm. Dr AM Zunaid Siddiqui, CVASU professor of pathology and parasitology, led the study. The researchers have claimed that this fabric is an anti-microbial coronavirus killer made from a special blend of advanced silver and vesicle technology - which kills 99.99 percent of the virus in just two minutes. Even the Covid-19-resistant ingredients remain effective in the textile materials after washing 20 times. When the virus comes in contact with the fabric, it will be destroyed in just two minutes. This coronavirus-resistant fabric can be used for preparing personal protective equipment (PPE), face masks, isolation gowns, overalls, shoe covers, denims, non-denims, pants, shirts, ladies wear, T-shirts, polo shirts, home textiles, air filters and even hospital uniforms. Mohammad Razzakul Hossain Tutul, managing director of Root Group of Companies, said that a memorandum of understanding is underway between Root Group and CVASU for further research in this regard. Root Group will provide all necessary financing to continue the research, he added. \"The economy has almost come to a standstill for the outbreak of Covid-19. We have taken this initiative to see if we can get people back to work,\" Tutul said. \"Although no specific drug or vaccine has been developed to prevent coronavirus, the users of this fabric will be able to ensure protection against Covid-19 infection,\" he added.

{"title": "Meta launches smart glasses with built-in display, reaching for 'superintelligence'", "body": "Meta Platforms on Wednesday launched its first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display, seeking to extend the momentum of its Ray-Ban line, one of the early consumer hits of the artificial intelligence era. CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off what he called Meta Ray-Ban Display, although some demos of the new technology did not go as planned, with a call to the glasses failing to go through, for instance. \"I don't know what to tell you guys,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I keep on messing this up.\" The crowd applauded. Meta has tasted success with its smart glasses, and Zuckerberg described them as the perfect way to expand toward the 'superintelligence' promised by artificial intelligence, a concept where AI surpasses human intelligence in every possible way. \"Glasses are the ideal form factor for personal superintelligence, because they let you stay present in the moment while getting access to all of these AI capabilities that make you smarter, help you communicate better, improve your memory, improve your senses, and more,\" Zuckerberg said. The new Display glasses have a small digital display in the right lens for basic tasks such as notifications. They will start at $799 and be available on September 30 in stores. The launch at Meta's annual Connect conference for developers, held at its Menlo Park, California, headquarters, is its latest attempt to catch up in the high-stakes AI race. While the social media giant has been at the forefront of developing smart glasses, it trails rivals such as OpenAI and Alphabet's Google in rolling out advanced AI models. Zuckerberg has kicked off a Silicon Valley talent war to poach engineers from rivals and promised to spend tens of billions of dollars on cutting-edge AI chips. The new glasses come as Meta is facing scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media platforms. Reuters reported in August that Meta chatbots engaged children in provocative conversations about sex and race, while whistleblowers said earlier this month that researchers were told not to study the harmful effects of virtual reality on children. Meta also unveiled on Wednesday a new pair of Oakley-branded glasses called Vanguard aimed at athletes and priced at $499. The device integrates with fitness platforms such as Garmin and Strava to deliver real-time training stats and post-workout summaries and offers nine hours of battery life. It will be available starting on October 21. It also updated its previous Ray-Ban line, which does not have a built-in display but now offers almost twice the battery life of the earlier generation and a better camera at $379, higher than the previous generation's $299 price. All the devices have existing features such as Meta's AI assistant, cameras, hands-free control and livestreaming to the company's social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram. While analysts do not expect the Display glasses to post strong sales, they believe it could be a step toward the planned 2027 launch of Meta's \"Orion\" glasses. Meta unveiled a prototype of that last year and Zuckerberg described it as \"the time machine to the future.\" \"It wasn't long ago that consumers were introduced to AI on glasses and in recent quarters brands have also begun to include displays, enabling new use cases,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. \"However, consumer awareness and product availability of AI glasses with display remains limited. This will change as Meta, Google, and others launch products in the next 18 months.\" IDC forecasts worldwide shipments of augmented reality/ virtual reality headsets and display-less smart glasses will increase by 39.2% in 2025 to 14.3 million units, with Meta driving much of the growth thanks to demand for the Ray-Bans it makes with EssilorLuxottica.

{"title": "The case for an overhaul: Diagnosis from the new PPP authority CEO", "body": "It has been a month since I have had the opportunity to look under the hood of our PPP Authority. One does not have to be a career expert on Public-Private Partnership to see that we have a high-powered engine poorly fitted on the wrong chassis. Therefore, all we see from outside is a misfiring car with occasional black smoke from the exhaust. Over a decade into existence, successful PPP projects are few and far between. Only 4 out of 81 projects have reached the finish line, 8 remain partially complete, and the rest have formed a long tail of ongoing projects. An ageing analysis of ongoing projects suggests that over 70% of the projects are more than 5 years old. So where did we go wrong? Perhaps we misaligned our ambition with our ability to execute. The market and experts seem to have converged in citing the importance of PPP for a transition economy like Bangladesh. We must continue the beastly demand for infrastructural development at scale to catch up with our rivals. And that too with the government's coffers merrily looted by her own countrymen for over a decade. Therefore, an off-balance sheet solution like PPP backed by the right level of risk allocation could bridge the gap with private capital. Additionally, the Bangladesh government's abysmal track record in on-time project completion is another reason to have a private partner who could inject the much-needed sense of urgency. However, the PPP model has produced mixed results across the world. The Neoliberal supporters have been harassed by many throughout history. PPPs fail when we pick the wrong projects, either due to sheer incompetence or a poorly designed process. PPPs fail when we take too long to negotiate, losing sight of cost overruns. And PPPs fail when we are just deeply corrupt. File Photo: TBS In Bangladesh's case, sadly, they all are on display.

He said, \"A quick, safe and sustainable repatriation of the refugees in Bangladesh will benefit all parties.\" The Indian minister has written a letter to the Bangladesh foreign minister where the issue was mentioned, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Indian minister highly appreciated Bangladesh for showing generosity and humanity by sheltering the Rohingya. Jaishankar reiterated his government's promise to keep supporting the Bangladesh government and its people in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He also noted that partnership between the two neighbouring countries will continue for the development of the countries. Bangladesh is currently hosting more than 1.1 million Rohingya people. Some 750,000 members of the Muslim minority group in Myanmar's Rakhine state fled \"ethnic cleansing\" in their homeland in August 2017. Bangladesh has repeatedly called on the international community to put pressure on neighbouring Myanmar to take back its citizens. But despite several attempts to repatriate the refugees, none returned to their homeland citing Myanmar's failure to create conditions conducive to their \"voluntary, safe and dignified\" return.

{"title": "Mandatory masks, Mickey at a distance as Walt Disney World reopens", "body": "Mickey waved from a distance and visitors wore colorful face masks with mouse ears on Saturday as Florida's Walt Disney World opened to the public for the first time in four months amid a surge of coronavirus cases in the state. Walt Disney Co welcomed a limited number of guests to its two most popular parks at the sprawling Orlando complex, the world's most-visited theme park resort, with a host of safety measures designed to reassure visitors and reduce the chances of catching the sometimes deadly virus. Executives felt confident they had a responsible plan for reopening in phases during the pandemic, said Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney's parks, experiences and products division. \"This is the new world that we're operating in, and I don't see that changing anytime soon,\" D'Amaro said in an interview on Saturday after he greeted guests and workers at the park. Disney's reopening of parks in Asia helped provide assurance about moving ahead in Florida, he added. Disneyland Shanghai opened in May, followed by the Disneyland parks in Hongkong and Tokyo in June and July, respectively. \"I feel really good about our environment,\" D'Amaro said. \"We're taking this seriously.\" Disney did not say how many people entered Walt Disney World on Saturday, but D'Amaro said he saw \"really good demand\" for reservations in the short term and into 2021. At the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, the two parks that reopened Saturday, guests and employees wore face masks, underwent temperature screenings and were told to social distance everywhere from streets to rides. Plexiglass separated rows in lines, and ground markings indicated where people should stand. Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios, the two other Walt Disney World parks, are scheduled to reopen on Wednesday. The resort suspended parades, fireworks and other activities that draw crowds, as well as up-close encounters with Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and other characters. Instead, characters appeared on floats or on horseback. 'So Happy To Be Back' Some pictures online showed people close together waiting to get in. Disney employees, called cast members, began enforcing distancing requirements after about 30 minutes, Carlye Wisel, a journalist who writes about theme parks, said on Twitter. Other videos showed people inside staying apart, cheering, taking selfies and enjoying the park without long lines. \"I'm so happy to be back!\" a fan who calls herself That Crazy Disney Lady said in a video posted on YouTube. Florida has emerged as an epicenter of Covid-19 infections. Over the past two weeks, the state reported 109,000 new coronavirus cases, more than any other US state. Still, many Disney fans and workers were eager for Disney World to open its gates. The resort employs 77,000 people. Disney said it had trained employees to nudge guests who become lax about the rules. Plentiful signs and audio announcements every 10 minutes reminded visitors of the new measures. \"There is a shared responsibility here so guests are going to have to do their part,\" D'Amaro said. Coronavirus shutdowns have devastated Disney's film, TV and theme park businesses. Having guests back at Walt Disney World is key to the company's financial recovery. About 75% of the parks unit's operating income comes from Orlando, Imperial Capital analyst David Miller estimates. Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, approved Disney World's reopening plans in late May, before the current surge. About 750 stage performers were absent because of a dispute over coronavirus testing. The Actors Equity union wants Disney to provide regular testing of members who must perform without masks. Disney has said it is following health experts' recommendations to focus on other safeguards. If employees seek tests on their own, Disney's health insurance will cover it, according to a source familiar with the matter. Seven other unions reached agreement with Disney on conditions for returning to work. Shanghai Disneyland has increased capacity from its original limit of 20%, or about 16,000 people a day, when it re-opened in May. Guest surveys showed \"exceptionally strong\" satisfaction with the Shanghai experience and the safety measures, D'Amaro said.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection did not provide details in its statement on Wang, a Communist Party secretary. It is relatively rare for a sitting minister to undergo investigation. In President Xi Jinping's years-long corruption purge, the defence ministry announced last week it was investigating the nation's top general, Zhang Youxia, who is second only to Xi in the military leadership. Xi said this month that anti-corruption is a battle China must not lose, following a record 65 probes into high-ranking officials last year, while scrutiny has expanded to former leaders of universities and state-owned enterprises. Wang, 63, took office in July 2022, after serving as chairman of state-owned power generator National Energy Investment Corp. He appeared on Tuesday, speaking at a regular internal meeting where cadres engage in self-criticism, according to an official release from the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Earlier, the securities regulator issued a letter to sixty one directors of twenty-two listed companies, who failed to maintain the mandatory rule of holding a minimum two percent of shareholding of their companies' paid-up capital, as per the securities laws. BSEC issued a 45 working days ultimatum to ensure shareholding rules for the directors in order to continue their directorships, otherwise they would be removed from the related company's board.

{"title": "From Japan to Brazil, voters could shake markets in key election year", "body": "From Japan to Brazil, elections could add yet more uncertainty this year to markets already whipped by US policy gyrations and heightened geopolitical tension. Japan's election this coming weekend is among the most unpredictable in years, while polls across Latin America will test the region's rightward shift. Here are some of the year's most significant elections for markets: Japan's snap election on 8 February could loosen fiscal purse-strings in the developed world's most indebted nation, on a debt-to-GDP basis. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi wants to convert personal popularity into support for her expansionary fiscal policies and bolster her coalition government's position in parliament. Latest polls show her approval rating has slipped a touch. Investors expect pressure on Japanese bonds to continue, and some analysts reckon 10-year yields will hit 3% this year, from just over 2% now. Colombians will vote as many as three times, starting in March, to choose new legislators and a new president to replace Gustavo Petro, a leftist who has clashed with US President Donald Trump. Colombian stocks outperformed regional peers last year, but bond investors hope Latam's rightward shift will sweep up Colombia, too, restoring orthodox economic policies. \"If there is a change to the right...there's potential for some fiscal adjustment,\" said Ninety One portfolio manager Nicolas Jaquier. Jaquier said a victory for Ivan Cepeda of Petro's coalition could allow him to make structural changes at the central bank and supreme court - removing roadblocks that slowed some of Petro's policies. Hungary Hungary's April vote is the opposition's best chance in years to end Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 16-year-long run. Centre-right party Tisza has a polling lead over Orban's right-wing Fidesz, but the outcome remains uncertain. Cost of living concerns are high, and Orban has used fiscal giveaways to assuage voter worries. Fitch Ratings cut Hungary's credit rating outlook to negative last year, citing \"significantly worsened\" public finance projections that reflected new measures in advance of the election. Tisza has pledged to repair ties with the European Union and unblock funding. Citi's Luis E. Costa estimates that could mobilise 10 billion euros ($11.9 billion), which alongside other reforms could \"enable higher investment spending, accompanied by a lower fiscal deficit and reduced risk premia\". United Kingdom Local elections usually don't attract the attention of foreign investors, but May's ballot might. Keir Starmer's ruling Labour Party is trailing in opinion polls to the populist Reform UK and has struggled to deliver on promises to strengthen the economy. Markets are sensitive to signs that the fiscally restrained Starmer might be replaced, as seen by a recent bond selloff. Societe Generale's UK economist Sam Cartwright says a new British leader would not have scope to significantly lift government borrowing if Starmer is replaced, his base-case scenario. Britain's next parliamentary election must be held by August 2029. Ethiopia and Zambia Ethiopia and Zambia, both battling back from debt default, hold summer elections. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Prosperity Party will almost certainly win a June vote, as key opposition groups plan a boycott. In Zambia, President Hakainde Hichilema is currently expected to win in August, though Chatham House experts warn that citizens' lives have yet to improve despite progress on debt restructuring and economic reform. Investors are closely watching both countries as they seek opportunities in frontier markets. Zambia's economy has proved more resilient than expected, and Ethiopia's defaulted bond is trading above par despite the ongoing default. Brazil Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading polls for the October election against Flavio Bolsonaro - a right-wing senator and the son of previous President Jair Bolsonaro. Leftist Lula, 80, managed a truce with US President Donald Trump despite clashing over tariffs, Venezuela and the elder Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup. \"A Lula victory...could be quite negative for prices,\" Tellimer's Geronimo Mansutti wrote, citing concerns of \"four more years of wide deficits and a higher debt path\". A fourth term could also leave Lula - a progressive champion - facing more clashes with Trump. But Ninety One's Jaquier pointed to Lula's value as a \"known quantity\", adding that he is pragmatic and likely to appoint a credible team to make fiscal adjustments. United States The US November mid-term elections will determine who controls Congress and are an important test for Trump. Affordability is a hot-button issue and the White House has scrambled to offer proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns, including capping credit card interest rates. Polls show that Americans are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy. The incumbent's party historically suffers during mid-terms and the president recently conceded that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip on Congress. \"Clearly the president would like to see economic growth booming and financial markets rallying, and this will play a big part in his narrative and policies in the coming months,\" said Zurich Insurance chief markets strategist Guy Miller. \"The policies into that election will impact all of us.\" Hungary's April vote is the opposition's best chance in years to end Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 16-year-long run.

Leftist Lula, 80, managed a truce with US President Donald Trump despite clashing over tariffs, Venezuela and the elder Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup. \"A Lula victory...could be quite negative for prices,\" Tellimer's Geronimo Mansutti wrote, citing concerns of \"four more years of wide deficits and a higher debt path\". A fourth term could also leave Lula - a progressive champion - facing more clashes with Trump. But Ninety One's Jaquier pointed to Lula's value as a \"known quantity\", adding that he is pragmatic and likely to appoint a credible team to make fiscal adjustments. The US November mid-term elections will determine who controls Congress and are an important test for Trump. Affordability is a hot-button issue and the White House has scrambled to offer proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns, including capping credit card interest rates. Polls show that Americans are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy. The incumbent's party historically suffers during mid-terms and the president recently conceded that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip on Congress. \"Clearly the president would like to see economic growth booming and financial markets rallying, and this will play a big part in his narrative and policies in the coming months,\" said Zurich Insurance chief markets strategist Guy Miller. \"The policies into that election will impact all of us.\"", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/worldbiz/politics/japan-brazil-voters-could-shake-markets-key-election-year-1350106", "date": "2026-02-02T12:10:00+06:00", "author": "Reuters 02 February, 2026, 12:10 pm Last modified: 02 February, 2026, 12:14 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 1394, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:36:06.871529"}

{"title": "Delay in Covid-19 test report delivery in Dinajpur", "body": "It takes up to 16 days to get the result of a coronavirus sample test from the PCR lab of Dinajpur M Abdur Rahim Medical College Hospital (MARMC). It has also been alleged that the sample of the same person was negative elsewhere but found positive at MARMC. And this has caused widespread anger among the locals. Concerned people say that the results are delayed because the number of samples far exceeds the hospital's capacity to test them. So, the process has created a backlog in sample testing They also believe that the problem will be solved if the number of PCR labs is increased. Dhiman Das, a journalist from Khansama upazila of Dinajpur, developed coronavirus symptoms on June 8. On June 13, he provided samples for Covid-19 test to MARMC, and he got a positive result after 15 days - on June 28. He said, \"After providing sample for Covid-19 test, I recovered. Despite the recovery, I was in home quarantine until June 20. And once I felt I was completely fit, I got out of the home.\" However, his home was under lockdown after receiving the Covid-19 test result on June 28. So, he expressed annoyance as he did not receive the result in time. Alongside Dhiman Das, AH Nur Islam Shah, chairman of Nashratpur union parishad under Chrirbandar upazila, and four others of his family submitted samples. Since the result delivery took a long time, they tested again on June 19 at Syedpur cantonment booth. The report was negative for them. However, they received the test result from MARMC on 29 June, after 16 days, and it was positive. \"The report from MARMC came positive for four of my family, including myself. But the report from CMH was negative,\" said Nur Islam Shah. He said that they were all are fine and healthy. But they submitted the samples to remove confusion. He also made the observation that patients will live or die if the Covid-19 test results are delayed. Seeking anonymity, a nurse serving at the surgery ward of MARMC said, \"I had a fever and shortness of breath while on duty on June 21. I gave the sample at 11 o'clock on the same day. The report of the person who worked with me came back positive.\" She said that so far she had not received her report. \"I have tried to get information from the civil surgeon's office, but it was not there, too,\" she added. Rajendra Nath Roy of Chapaipur village in Mujatibazar of Bochaganj upazila of the district submitted the sample on June 16. After 13 days, on June 29, his report came out as Covid-19 positive. However, he claimed that he had recovered earlier and said, \"In the meantime, I have gone to work in the field. I've been with people as well.\" Mahmudul Hasan is a resident of Singra Rameshwarpur Dakshinpara village in Ghoraghat upazila. He submitted samples on June 16 for a Covid-19 test at the upazila Health Complex, and received the test result after 13 days, on June 29. The test result was positive. \"By the time I received the result as positive, I had completely recovered. I tested again at Sheikh Fazilatunnessa Hospital the next day and the report was negative. But my residence has been locked down,\" he said. Many of the locals alleged that they get the result after 10 – 15 days. They are of the opinion that they recover from the symptoms by the time they get the test results. But they are asked to stay at home, and at times they are socially ostracised. Dhiman Das, the journalist of Khansama upazila said, \"I was told to stay at home. But why should I stay indoors when I am fit? I got the result after a delay and that is not my fault.\" He also said that everyone around him stopped talking to him when he was found to be Covid-19 positive. On condition of anonymity, a medical staff member serving at the RT-PCR lab of the microbiology department at MARMC said, \"We are trying to speed up the reports. We can test 188 samples in 24 hours.\" The man also said, \"But 300 to 350 samples arrive daily from Panchagarh, Thakurgaon, Dinajpur and Nilphamari districts. We test all the samples according to serial number. But due to lack of capacity, it is not possible to test all the samples.\" Dr Shah Mohammad Ezaz ul Haque, Dinajpur District Corona Control Room Assistant and Medical Officer of the civil surgeon's office, said that both the reports of that UP chairman were correct. \"Since he gave the sample on June 13, he had coronavirus in his body at that time. But he tested again on the 19th and the report was negative because there was no virus in his body,\" he added. It's an usual event since he gave the sample on June 13 at MARMC, his sample came back positive, he said. Abdul Quddus, civil surgeon of Dinajpur said that the first coronavirus positive report came in Dinajpur on April 14. \"The samples arrive at this lab from all places in four districts including Dinajpur. Two shifts in a day can test 188 samples altogether. So it is seen that around 800 to 1,000 samples are piled at the end of the week.\" So there is a delay in delivering the report, he said, adding that the problem will be solved if the number of labs are increased. delay / COVID-19 / test report / Dinajpur", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/coronavirus-chronicle/covid-19-bangladesh/delay-covid-19-test-report-delivery-dinajpur-102250", "date": "2020-07-05T22:45:00+06:00", "author": "Bipul Sarkar Sunny 05 July, 2020, 10:45 pm Last modified: 05 July, 2020, 10:59 pm", "category": null, "language": "en", "token_count": 921, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:36:13.381866"}
{"title": "Former cricket stars Afridi, Gillespie slam ICC for replacing Bangladesh with Scotland", "body": "Former cricketing heavyweights Shahid Afridi and Jason Gillespie have launched a scathing attack on the International Cricket Council (ICC), accusing the governing body of 'hypocrisy' and 'double standards' after it officially replaced Bangladesh with Scotland in the 2026 T20 World Cup. The backlash follows the ICC's confirmation on Saturday that Scotland would take Bangladesh's spot in Group C, after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to send its team to India citing security concerns. The ICC justified the move by stating there was an 'absence of any credible or verifiable security threat'. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi expressed deep disappointment on social media platform X, pointing out the glaring inconsistency in how the ICC handles security claims from different nations. He drew a sharp parallel to India's refusal to tour Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy, a decision the ICC accommodated. \"It accepted India's security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh,\" Afridi wrote. \"Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance... The ICC should build bridges, not burn them.\" Australian legend and former Pakistan red-ball coach Jason Gillespie echoed these sentiments, openly questioning why a neutral venue solution—often used for India—was not offered to Bangladesh. \"Has there been an explanation from the ICC why Bangladesh could not play their games outside of India?\" Gillespie asked on X. \"From memory, India refused to play Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan and they were allowed to play those games outside of Pakistan. Can someone make this make sense?!?!\" Scotland, beneficiaries of the standoff, will now join England, the West Indies, Italy, and Nepal in Group C.

{"title": "A vision for tomorrow: Tarique Rahman’s roadmap to transform Bangladesh’s economy", "body": "Tarique Rahman has outlined a modern and forward-looking vision for Bangladesh in his recent interview with the Financial Times—a blueprint that, if effectively implemented by the BNP, could transform the country's economy. Amid growing global tariff tensions that are unsettling major export economies, BNP Acting Chairman Tarique Rahman's proposal to establish \"Super Sourcing Hubs\" for leading e-commerce giants appears both timely and strategic. The initiative aims not only to capitalise on Bangladesh's advantageous trade position—such as lower tariffs with the United States, zero tariffs with Europe, and free trade agreements with China and Canada—but also to empower Bangladeshi youth and aspiring entrepreneurs with access to global platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, Shopify, and Walmart. Bangladesh's remarkable ascension as a powerhouse in ready-made garment manufacturing owes much to our loyal and abundant pool of workers, alongside the hard-working Bangladeshi entrepreneurs whose commitment to build world-class yet environmentally sustainable manufacturing capacity has set the nation apart. However, with growing global competition and ever-changing geopolitical dynamics, Bangladesh's strengths are gradually being matched by its Asian peers such as Cambodia. Even India has emerged as a viable and competitive sourcing ground for global retailers, particularly in view of incremental US tariffs freeing up manufacturing capacity for Europe and other markets across the world. Boosting district and village economies, handicrafts, and small industries Tarique Rahman's vision of establishing e-commerce retailers' Super Sourcing Hubs could empower and provide global market access to small entrepreneurs and cottage industries located far from the industrial concentrations of major metropolitan areas such as Dhaka and Chattogram. This would help boost regional economies, create employment, and minimise the desperate migration of fortune seekers to developed Western economies—journeys that too often result in loss of lives and economic hardship for families left behind. Artisans and creative entrepreneurs — sky will be the limit Artisans, creative entrepreneurs, and Facebook commerce business owners could find limitless opportunities in categories such as home, garden, and kitchen products. Sustainable jute rugs, terracotta planters, kitchen utensils, baby products like cotton baby clothes and wooden toys, as well as beauty and personal care items including Ayurvedic and organic cosmetics, yoga mats, and more, could all experience a nationwide manufacturing boom. This would also stimulate growth in supporting sectors such as logistics, delivery services, warehousing, banking, and mobile financial services (MFS). Tarique Rahman's Lee Kuan Yew moment Tarique Rahman and his family have endured immense difficulties and challenges over the past 18 years of self-exile. Having survived physical and mental torture during his interrogation after being arrested by the joint forces during the military-backed caretaker government back in 2007, and forcible removal from his homeland to a foreign country with no roots, his resilience remains extraordinary. To manage and lead a major political party like the BNP remotely demands exceptional leadership and mental tenacity, particularly while witnessing the hour-by-hour deterioration of the health of Bangladesh's democratic icon, his mother and former Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia. Her suffering in a century-old, unhygienic jail, and her repeated persecution by the Anti-Corruption Commission, reflect the adversity that has tested but never broken Rahman's spirit. His determination and mental fortitude have kept not only himself motivated but also inspired multiple generations of BNP members and followers. Under Tarique Rahman's leadership, Bangladesh has the potential to become the Singapore of South Asia. Given the country's central geographical location and its young, secular population, his vision to deliver economic prosperity to every corner of Bangladesh could one day turn this aspiration into reality. The dream of becoming a first-world nation like Singapore may seem distant now, but knowing Tarique Rahman's relentless pursuit of well-meditated progress for his fellow citizens, such a transformation could indeed be realised within less than a decade.

The deal was signed at a ceremony held at a hotel in Dhaka, a development industry insiders described as a milestone for private-sector involvement in the country's international connectivity infrastructure. On behalf of the BPCS Consortium, the agreement was signed by Aminul Hakim, chief executive officer of Metacore Subcom Limited; Arif Al Islam, managing director and chief executive of Summit Communications Limited; and Md Mashiur Rahman, chief executive of CdnNet Communications Limited. Nokia was represented by Prashant Malkani, head of sales unit at Nokia India, and Suman Prasad, senior sales account director at the company. Photo: Courtesy Senior Nokia officials, including Jibitesh Nayal, head of emerging business, Rahul Derwani, marketing manager, Mohammad R Islam, account manager, and Christopher Samuel, head of sales at Nokia Bangladesh, were also present. Several foreign diplomats attended the event, including European Union Ambassador Michael Miller, Finnish diplomat to India Antti Herlevi, and representatives from the Japanese Embassy, highlighting the project's international importance. Speaking at the event, consortium officials said Bangladesh's current bandwidth consumption stands at around 9,000 gigabits per second (Gbps). Demand is expected to rise sharply to nearly 20,000 Gbps by mid-2027 and to about 50,000 Gbps by 2030, increasing the need for private investment in submarine cable infrastructure. The consortium has already invested around Tk600 crore in the project and plans to spend a further Tk1,200 to Tk1,300 crore to launch three cable pairs after June 2026. At present, more than 60% of Bangladesh's bandwidth is sourced from India through international terrestrial cables, leading to a significant outflow of foreign currency. The planned Singapore-Cox's Bazar route, with three cable pairs, is expected to reduce this dependence and move the country closer to bandwidth self-sufficiency. Officials said Nokia's SLTE technology would allow lower power consumption, reduce space requirements in data centres and improve network management, helping to cut operational costs. Using Nokia equipment at both cable landing stations is also expected to ensure a high level of cyber security. They added that these efficiencies could bring long-term benefits for consumers, including more affordable internet services as capacity increases and costs fall.

{"title": "Marketing system needs reform for farmers’ wellbeing: Experts", "body": "Farmers of the country cannot be benefited under the conventional agricultural marketing system here, according to experts. It is necessary to devise innovative strategies and implement a fair distribution policy alongside online marketing for the wellbeing of farmers, they said. Speakers said this at a virtual seminar styled \"Digital marketing under pandemic situation: Present and aftermath\" organised by Dhaka School of Economics (DScE), a constituent institution of Dhaka University, on Saturday. Professors and educationists from various countries, including the United States, Canada, Thailand, India, Australia, and Bangladesh, addressed the online seminar, which was held in three sessions. Besides, chief executives of different corporate sectors and entrepreneurs also spoke at the webinar. Around 70 experts and students from six countries took part in the event. Professor Dr Muhammad Mahboob Ali, progremme coordinator of the entrepreneurship economics department of the DScE presided over the programme, while Chairman of the DScE Governing Council and Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad was present as the session chair. Dr Kholiquzzaman said the distribution system must be ensured up to the grassroots level during the coronavirus situation. New strategies have to be adapted to reach products and benefits there, he added. Dr Muhammad Mahboob Ali pointed out that restrictions on sacrificing animals at homesteads and slum areas during the forthcoming Eid-ul-Adha might affect the demand for sacrificial animals, causing farmers to face losses. He, therefore, stressed bringing changes to the management system alongside reforming the marketing and distribution to ensure benefit for cattle farmers during the current pandemic situation. Dr Vichayanan Rattanawiboonsom, dean of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Communications at Naresuan University of Thailand, attended a technical session of the webinar as the chief guest. Besides, Professor Dr Kripa Shankar Gupta, director of KSG Centre for Quality Minds, and Taslim Ahmed, distribution and management strategist based in Canada, presented papers in the session. Among others, Helal Ahmed Chowdhury, professor at the BIBM and former managing director of Pubali Bank; Md Zahir Uddin Arif, professor of marketing department at Jagannath University; Dr Md Sabur Khan, chairman of Daffodil Group; and Anis A Khan, former managing director and CEO of Mutual Trust Bank participated in the webinar.

{"title": "Economic recovery depends on creating employment for jobless people: Sanem", "body": "Before the Covid-19 pandemic people migrated from villages to cities to find work. However, when the pandemic hit many of these people, including expatriate workers in the Middle East, became jobless and returned to their villages. Creating employment opportunities for these people in rural areas will be a big challenge, so easy loans must be arranged for them to become entrepreneurs. Not engaging these people in economic activities will harm the country's economy severely, said the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (Sanem), a nongovernmental research organisation. Experts expressed their opinions at a virtual seminar titled \"Sanem Netizen Forum: Episode 8\" on Saturday. The program was moderated by Sanem Executive Director Dr Selim Raihan, who also presented the keynote paper at the programme. Dr Raihan said, \"There are some problems regarding the disbursement of the Tk20,000 crore stimulus package for the small and medium enterprise sector. The banks are not interested in it. So, loan facilities must be arranged to develop the rural people as entrepreneurs, and the microcredit organisations have to come forward to do that.\" Addressing the job losses in manufacturing and the garments sector, he pointed out that a reverse migration trend has emerged as low-income families are moving to rural areas from urban areas – where they might not be able to find employment. Dr Raihan also said many expatriate workers returned to their homes permanently, which has increased the remittances recently. The government must take initiatives to assist these people. Dr Raihan also said, \"The banking sector is facing pressure due to the government's stimulus packages. The problems and the weaknesses of this sector must be identified. The plan to restore the economy to its previous condition will not be successful without implementing the stimulus packages announced by the government.\" Dr Raihan, professor at the Department of Economics, Dhaka University, also said, \"People who recently became poor must be brought under the social safety net programme, which has some weaknesses.\" He further said the prime minister announced Tk2,500 would be provided for 50 lakh families, but only 17 lakh families have received the assistance. So, the monitoring system must be strengthened in this regard. Involving both government and nongovernmental institutions will ensure the proper implementation of this programme. \"The banking sector's weakness has delayed the implementation of this programme,\" he added. In his presentation Dr Raihan highlighted the importance of strong institutions in rebuilding the health sector, banking sector and taxation. \"While people are becoming jobless, prices of essentials on the market are increasing. Those who were running businesses with small capital are now willing to keep their money as savings,\" he continued. \"So, many people may not resume their businesses at all and a large number of entrepreneurs in manufacturing, garments and service sectors may fall out of the economy. These people also need budget assistance and loans with small interest rates,\" he said. He added, \"The reverse migration trend induced by the economic hardships in urban areas entails the emergence of new socio-economic challenges in the rural areas as rural wages can be adversely affected, children's education can be hampered, drop-out rates can increase, cases of early marriage can rise, and gender disparities can widen.\" Dr Sayema Haque Bidisha, professor at the Department of Economics, Dhaka University, said, \"The government should focus on decentralising employment opportunities, the scope of getting loans and quality education. This will ease the challenge of recovering the economy a bit.\" Dr Sayema said the government included a Tk100 crore fund in last year's budget to create new entrepreneurs, but such a fund is not in the budget this year. Mahtab Uddin, a fellow of Sanem, said, \"The government should focus on attracting Chinese investment to Bangladesh. Our logistics support is weak, so investments from China are going to Vietnam.\" \"Additionally, we need a skilled workforce, which Vietnam already has. Their workers are internationally certified.

{"title": "NBR rolls out full online utilisation permission through CBMS", "body": "The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has entered a new phase of digital service delivery by making the issuance of Utilisation Permission (UP) under the Customs Bond Management System (CBMS) completely online. The use of CBMS software was made mandatory from today (1 January) for receiving and issuing all UP-related services following an earlier circular issued by the NBR. All UPs are now being issued online through the three customs bond commissionerates under the NBR, ending the long-standing practice of manual submission and approval. The NBR had launched the automated CBMS software on 1 January last year with the aim of delivering all services to bonded warehouse licence-holding entities through an online platform. Through the system, bonded warehouse operators can obtain UP online from the respective customs bond commissionerates in line with the approved policies of the Duty Exemption and Drawback Office for duty-free import of raw materials. With the introduction of online UP issuance, beneficiary industrial units under the bonded warehouse system no longer need to submit paper-based applications or remain physically present at customs bond commissionerates. The CBMS is a modern, technology-driven system that allows end-to-end online processing of UP applications, including submission, scrutiny and approval. According to the NBR, the system will ensure faster service delivery, greater transparency and improved accountability, while eliminating the complexities of manual documentation and reducing person-dependent interventions.

{"title": "Bangladesh’s Agar-Attar hub: The timeless scent of Sujanagar", "body": "The air in Sujanagar does not smell like that of a typical Bangladeshi village. It does not only carry the scent of damp earth or cooking fires. Instead, as you walk the winding rural roads of this corner in Moulvibazar, a heavy, woody and ethereal fragrance clings to your clothes. It is the scent of Agar-Attar — an essence so rare and ancient that it has been gifted to kings and mentioned in the sacred traditions of all the three major religions in the region. Almost every house in Sujanagar seems to hold a factory, small or large. Men slice darkened wood into thin strips while nails are carefully pulled from trunks, and women sit in courtyards turning larger pieces into smaller chips with steady hands. Inside nearby rooms, steel cauldrons bubble in long rows, releasing vapour that slowly condenses into liquid gold. Among the trees lining village roads, behind kitchens and beside ponds, artisans perform the most delicate act of the entire process: they drive thick iron nails into the trunk of the Agar tree, one inch apart, until it is \"mutilated\" from base to branch. \"The more wounds in the Agar tree, the better the Attar,\" one local said. Barlekha upazila of Moulvibazar is widely known as the birthplace of Agar-Attar. According to various sources, Agar cultivation in this area dates back to around 400 years. Written records, however, take the story even further back. In Harsha Charita, written in Sanskrit in 652 AD, the author notes receiving Agarwood and liquid Attar collected from Barlekha as a gift from King Bhaskar Varman of Assam. Later accounts say that after defeating King Gour Govinda, Hazrat Shahjalal (R.) discovered valuable Agarwood and Attar in the royal treasury. By 1590 AD, Ain-i-Akbari, written by Abul Fazl Allami, offered detailed descriptions of Agarwood, Agar oil and the extraction of Attar. Arab traders of the eighth and ninth centuries carried Agar alongside spices, salt, rice, and handloom fabrics. For centuries, Sylhet — particularly Barlekha — was considered a paradise of Agar-Attar. Until the 1950s, the world depended almost entirely on this region. One hundred per cent of the global Agar-Attar supply came from here, controlled by farmers and traders of Sylhet. Before the partition of India, Sujanagar alone had around 300 Agar-Attar factories, while only three existed in Assam and Nagaland combined. At the beginning of the last century, that number rose to about 450 in Sujanagar. All were privately owned; none were established by the state. Across Sujanagar's 30 villages, more than 80% of houses host factories. Over 35,000 men and women depend on this work. On 12 February 2024, Agar-Attar from Moulvibazar was officially recognised as a Geographical Indication product. In the early days, traders collected Agarwood from the Patharia hills of Barlekha and adjoining hilly areas of India, bringing it down to Sujanagar for Attar production. Over time, cultivation moved closer to home. Homestead backyards became gardens; gardens became an industry. Today, Agar is cultivated across Barlekha as well as Kamalganj, Kulaura and Juri upazilas. Within the Sujanagar union, villages such as Saldigha, Rafinagar, Hashimpur, Chintapur and Barothal are densely planted. Agar trees grow along roads, beside houses, across more than half the land in the union. Every tree — small, medium or large — holds value. Golam Dastagir, an Agar farmer from Sujanagar, noted, \"Sujanagar village has already gained worldwide recognition as the village of Agar-Attar. For generations, the people of this village have been involved in the Agar-Attar industry.\" Men and women work together in the entire process. Due to the increase in demand both at home and abroad over the last few years, many newcomers have joined the industry. New gardens and factories have also sprung up in surrounding areas, changing the lives of many. Agar farmers in Sujanagar said that saplings are usually planted on flat or slightly elevated land. Within 15 to 20 years of planting, some trees naturally start producing raw material for Attar. However, trees that are 50, 80, or even 100 years old yield Attar of grade-1 or grade-2 quality. Most trees in the world lose value when they rot, but the Agar is an exception. Without rot, the tree has no market value. To induce resin formation, hundreds of iron nails are hammered into the tree, deliberately wounding it. The more nails a tree receives, the more resin it produces — and the higher the eventual Attar yield. After the nails are driven in, resin collects around them over a period of three to five years. Once the resin has matured, the tree is cut down and brought to factories. The nails are removed, and the wood is cut into small pieces. These pieces are soaked in water, often in houses or large drums, for one to one-and-a-half months. After soaking, the wood is placed in steel cauldrons or large pots and heated with gas. The resulting vapour condenses drop by drop into containers, producing raw Attar. This is then bottled in small glass jars or bottles. Attar produced through this nail-hammering method usually fetches a lower price compared with naturally produced Attar, which develops without human intervention. Besides the traditional method of driving nails into Agar trees, there is another technique for producing Attar: the CA (Chemical Application) method. In this process, holes are made in the Agar tree, and special capsules are inserted into them. The holes are then sealed. The part of the tree that naturally produces raw material for Attar is called \"gyne\". Once the gyne matures, the tree is cut down and the gyne is separated. It is first chopped into smaller pieces called \"chips\". From 40 kilograms of gyne, about six to seven tolas of Attar can be produced. The production cost of one tola ranges from Tk1,500 to Tk2,000, which is sold locally for Tk5,000 to Tk8,000. On the international market, depending on quality, the price can reach $20,000 to $30,000 per kilogram. The remaining gyne is exported to the Middle East, where burning Agarwood as incense is customary. Each kilogram of gyne can sell for Tk150,000 to Tk400,000. For trees wounded by nails, the same principle is applied artificially: the tree is cut, nails removed, and the damaged sections soaked in water for several months. The soaked wood is then heated in large steel cauldrons for up to 15 days. The resulting vapour is piped into containers, where it condenses into Attar. After months of soaking, the boiled wood pieces are removed from the cauldrons and exported as husk to countries in the Middle East and beyond. On average, each Attar producer in Sujanagar can produce about 200 tolas (one tola= 11.62 grams) of Attar per year, with a market value running into crores of Taka. Collectively, Attar producers in Sujanagar generate an annual revenue of approximately Tk500 crore to Tk700 crore. From Sujanagar to the Gulf Sujanagar union alone has around 250 small and medium factories, with another 50 across the Moulvibazar district. Officially, 176 are registered, while many smaller ones operate unregistered. Almost all run year-round. Mohammed Abdul Kabir, owner of Bay of Bengal Perfumery, says, \"We have Agar gardens on 10-12 bighas of land. Eighty people work in the factory. An average of 500 tolas of Attar is produced monthly using 18 machines. We export liquid Attar and Agarwood worth $250,000 annually. Perfume manufacturers and Attar brand houses in the Middle East buy raw Attar from us.\" After the nails are removed, the wood is soaked in water for several months. It is then heated in large steel cauldrons for up to 15 days. The resulting vapour is piped into containers, where it condenses into Attar. Raw Attar from Moulvibazar is popular across the Middle East, where Agarwood is also burned as incense. Depending on quality, Agarwood sells from a few hundred to over Tk100,000 per kilogram. Attar sells locally for Tk6,000 to Tk12,000 per tola, and much higher abroad. Currently, products are exported to Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, Malaysia, and Europe. Traders estimate that about 5,000 litres of raw Attar and up to 15,000 kilograms of Agarwood leave Moulvibazar annually. Transactions in the sector amount to Tk500-700 crore each year. Exporters struggling to scale up The challenges of the Agar-Attar industry, however, go beyond cultivation and production. Traders point to bureaucratic hurdles, rising energy costs and limitations in technology and infrastructure as key obstacles to growth. Ansarul Haque, president of the Bangladesh Agar and Attar Manufacturers and Exporters Association, explained, \"The CITES [Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora] certificate is one of the main obstacles to exporting Agar-Attar. To avoid the hassle of collecting this certificate, many traders are forced to send some products abroad themselves or sometimes through passengers. However, that money returns to the country as remittance. \"Proper planning and government patronage are needed for export. Energy is important in this sector. Currently, the price of gas is high. Also, as gas connections for new factories are closed, no one can start new production,\" he added. Haque also highlighted the limitations imposed by small-scale operations and lack of technology. \"Due to a lack of adequate capital, new technology cannot be used in Attar production to keep pace with globalisation. Moreover, the factories here are very small; it is not possible for everyone to complete the entire process and export. Some 10-12 businesses export products directly abroad. We demand adoption of a policy for the Agar-Attar industry and the establishment of an Agar-Attar Research Institute in Moulvibazar,\" he further said. The government has shown willingness to consider these demands. Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Urmi Bin-te Salam said, \"The matter of establishing an Agar-Attar Research Institute will be informed to the higher authorities. We will try to ensure their problems are solved and demands are met.\" Most trees in the world lose value when they rot, but the Agar is an exception. Without rot, the tree has no market value.

{"title": "‘People think that I can only score against Zimbabwe’", "body": "An international career spanning more than a decade. Still, Imrul Kayes' place in the national team is not cemented. He has been in and out of the side throughout his career but Imrul gives his all whenever he is called up. Kayes was dropped from the ODI side in December 2018 and the left-hander has been overlooked in the format since then. He was also overlooked for the 2019 World Cup. Imrul Kayes spoke to The Business Standard (TBS) about his career, life and beyond. TBS: How has life been over the past few months? Imrul: Bit of running, gym, watching TV, spending time with my family members- that's how it's been for the last three-four months. TBS: How difficult is it for cricketers like you to stay away from cricket for so many days? Imrul: To be honest, there are certain things that we can't control. At the moment, everything is uncertain. Being safe and healthy is the main priority at the moment. Still, staying away from cricket is definitely frustrating. TBS: What is the most important lesson you've learned during this period? Imrul: The uncertainty of life, you never know when you are going to die. People can fall sick and die all of a sudden. TBS: Almost all the series involving Bangladesh has been called off. How frustrating is it for you? Imrul: We don't get to play too many matches. It's always depressing to see so many series being postponed. One year is quite a long time for a cricketer. TBS: There has been no cricket at all since March in Bangladesh. So how difficult will the near future be the professional cricketers? Imrul: Cricketers who earn their livelihood playing only domestic cricket will be in deep trouble financially. It is a huge setback for them. TBS: What is the biggest life lesson you've learned while playing cricket? Imrul: Cricket teaches you to remain honest to yourself and your job. A cricketer who has a sporting mentality cannot do anything immoral. TBS: You played brilliantly against Zimbabwe in 2018. But you were dropped from the team after failing in two matches against West Indies. Since then you've been out of the team. Do you think it was unjust to axe you? Imrul: It was shocking. I scored a record number of runs against Zimbabwe. I opened in that series. Then suddenly I was demoted to number three in the next series. I couldn't do well there. Batting position is a very significant thing. But I never had a settled one. I was dropped from the World Cup squad. I was distraught. Because I knew I did my best to be picked in the squad. It was tough to digest, but there was nothing to do. I feel it's always easy to make me the scapegoat. The fans in our country notice only the present, nothing else. Whenever I score runs, people think that I can only score against Zimbabwe. Many cricketers score against Zimbabwe or other teams and get praised. But whenever I score runs, it becomes: Imrul Kayes scored against Zimbabwe. Bangladesh was about to lose against Zimbabwe in the match I scored 144. But still, nobody evaluated that innings properly saying that it was scored against Zimbabwe. This is very disheartening. You might not respect someone but you can't demean a person. I was also criticised when I scored the century against England. People said that it was a selfish innings and I couldn't guide the team to victory. Nobody can win a match single-handedly, I was left stranded in the middle. My hundred against England was given no value. Actually, it has become very easy to put in a comment about me. TBS: You made your debut in 2008. But still, you are not regular in the team. Is it completely your failure or others are also responsible? Imrul: I cannot blame my luck or blame others completely. I have to accept responsibility too. Yes, it was my failure to not perform in every match. I needed to be more consistent. But luck was not on my side. TBS: You have opened in a lot of matches with Tamim Iqbal. Tamim is definitely the first-choice opener. Do you think you could've performed better if you were given a sealed spot? Imrul: Many of us opened with Tamim. But Tamim also struggled at some point of his career. But the team backed him. If the others had got the backing like this, it would've been better for them. TBS: Were you given the freedom a cricket needs to perform well? Imrul: There was a time when I knew what my role was in the team. Jamie Siddons used to have me as an opener to see off the early burst. But when he left, things became difficult for me. I could not understand my role in the team. But you cannot change your playing style overnight. That's why I was in and out of the side. I can't say I was not given the freedom. But it would've been better for me if I had a specific role in the team. TBS: How difficult is it to deal with the criticism from the spectators? Imrul: Fans want to see only fours and sixes. But it's definitely not the way to play cricket. It's depressing when they don't evaluate our efforts. TBS: What's your biggest regret in your career? Imrul: Not playing the 2019 World Cup. I had contributions in many of our important victories. But I badly wanted to play the 2019 World Cup, which I couldn't.

Continued claims, which count workers who have filed claims for at least two weeks in a row, stood at 18.1 million. Economists have shifted their focus to continued claims earlier this summer, saying it is a better indicator of how many people are returning to work versus staying on benefits. But again the number is trending down slowly, and that doesn't bode well for the economic recovery. On top of that, many states have paused their economic reopening schedules following a rise in Covid-19 infections. That might keep people at home for longer, when they would have otherwise returned to work in later reopening phases.

{"title": "Asahi beers running out in Japan as cyberattack shutdown lingers", "body": "Japanese restaurants, bars and stores are running low on beer and other beverages from industry leader Asahi Group, as the impact from a cyberattack entered a fifth day today (3 October), with no resolution in sight. Known for its Super Dry beer and Nikka Whisky as well as non-alcoholic beverages, Asahi suspended operations in Japan on Monday, including order processing, shipping and call center functions after a cyberattack caused a system outage. The company began processing orders for some products on Wednesday by visiting customers in person and handwriting orders, it said. While it continues to take orders for food and soft drinks, it has not taken further orders for alcoholic beverages to prioritise outgoing shipments, which began on Friday for the first batch of manually filled orders, it said. Full Recovery Not In Sight Yet In updating its emergency responses, Asahi announced this evening that ransomware attacks on company servers had been confirmed, and that it aimed to restart call center operations to handle phone enquiries from customers next week. Asahi is working with outside specialists to restore its computer system, but it is unclear how soon the company can resume full operations, it said. Asahi also said it was looking into the potential impact on its earnings. The breach is the latest in a string of cyber and ransomware attacks targeting global companies. In Britain, luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover was forced to shut down its factories last month, while Marks & Spencer and the Co-op Group have also fallen victim to sophisticated breaches. Today in Tokyo, one eatery that normally only serves Asahi-branded beer said it was on its last keg of Asahi Super Dry, and that its supplier brought beer from rival Sapporo, a day earlier, citing the shortage. \"It's a bit of a problem,\" said Tomiko Yano, a chef at restaurant Kushiyaki Tosaka. \"We specialise in yakitori (skewered chicken) and it pairs really well with Super Dry.

The joint venture project is estimated to be worth Tk3,000 crore and is an outcome of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Saudi Arabia in October 2018, where a memorandum of understanding was signed. BCIC Chairman Md Mostafizur Rahman and EDII President and CEO Mohammad Nazib Al Hazi signed the investment contract on Monday at the BCIC headquarter in the capital, according to a press release. The project is scheduled to enter production in mid-2023 with a capacity to process 12,000 tonnes of clinker from limestone imported from India and 3,000 tonnes of cement per day. The production facility is expected to employ 700 people. The feasibility study for the project was done by Singapore-based DG Infratech Private Ltd. Local representatives of both the investor and consultant firms, alongside BCIC and industries ministry senior officials, were present at the contract signing ceremony. EDII is also implementing a $35 million project at the state-owned General Electric Manufacturing Company Limited (GEMCO) for manufacturing transformers and electricity devices.

{"title": "Wari residents adjust to restrictions on lockdown’s second day", "body": "Residents of the Wari area are adapting to lockdown measures, and cooperating more with the authorities, on the second day that restrictions on movement were imposed in the area. \"Some people wanted passes to go out, but the number of such people was lower than yesterday,\" said local ward councilor Sarwar Hasan to The Business Standard on Sunday. \"Mostly businessmen wanted to exit the area. We provided passes to a few of them, but mostly we tried to convince them not to go out for their wellbeing and that of their families,\" he added. To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the government has put the capital's Wari (Ward-41) area under a lockdown for 21 days from early Saturday. Eight roads and alleys have been blocked-off by bamboo barricades set up at the entrances. These are: Tipu Sultan Road, Jahangir Road, Dhaka-Sylhet Highway (Joykali Temple to Balda Garden), Larmini Street, Hare Street, War Street, Rankin Street, and Nawab Street. Members of law enforcement agencies surrounded the entire area and no people were seen roaming around there. During the 21-day-lockdown, all offices, schools, colleges, businesses, shops, markets and places of worship in the area will remain closed. Only a medicine company in that area has been allowed to operate on a limited scale, for a limited time during the day, as it is an emergency service, said Sarwar. The company can also use 14 vehicles to carry medicine, he said, adding that, \"From today we are not allowing in any other vehicles, except for emergency services – not even the cars belonging to the doctors who are providing treatment here.\" All shops, except pharmacies, are remaining closed. However, three super-shops in the area are being kept open on a limited scale to meet the residents' needs for essential items. Some 200 volunteers are working following the direction of the local councilor of the Dhaka South City Corporation to help the residents of the area. Previously on June 10, the East-Rajabazar area was put under lockdown on a pilot basis to curb the spread of Covid-19.

{"title": "A homecoming that signals more than a return", "body": "As dawn approached on Christmas day 2025, the city was wide awake. At 6 in the morning, the city was still shrouded in dense fog and the light was yet to prevail. But millions of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters have been waiting for this very morning. Wrapped in shawls and jackets, they poured out from every alley onto the streets, chanting the slogan, \"Ma mati dakchhe, Tarique Rahman ashchhe.\" The song 'Leader Ashchhe' by James played again and again. Tarique Rahman, the acting chairman of BNP, in self-exile following persecution, was returning to his motherland after nearly 18 long years. The day for which BNP supporters have waited, persevered, fought for years through inhumane repression by the Hasina regime was finally here. The scene at the welcome reception at 36 July Expressway at 300 Feet, Dhaka, reflected this enthusiasm. The strength and power of the BNP is rooted in its grassroots supporter base. They came in flocks, waving party flags, wearing bandanas and carrying paddy sheafs. Even the 'Dhan Manob' was there. What stood out was the presence of marginalised people among those from working-class backgrounds. Many arrived with their families, even with their children. The scene offered a telling glimpse into the social base that BNP attracts and claims to represent. Thousands of these supporters had arrived last night and slept outside. One such supporter, Sabuj, had come from Chandpur. \"I have lived outside many nights, running away from the police and the Awami League in the last 17 years. I have been waiting for this very day,\" he remarked. It is this section of the society that has sustained BNP's resilience, allowing it to remain the country's most formidable opposition force despite sustained repression. The depth of that support base was evident on Thursday. Another man had arrived the night before with his wife and children from Naogaon and slept on the street. Asked why he had gone to such lengths, he replied with a smile, \"Because Tarique Rahman is coming home.\" BNP supporters came to the venue waving party flags, wearing bandanas and carrying paddy sheafs.

Hardly anyone had eaten a proper meal or slept properly since the previous night. Yet, the anticipation was palpable. I walked inside the cordon and found a wall of people there. The supporters were beating drums and singing songs. Documentaries were being screened on digital billboards across Dhaka. After a while, senior leaders started giving speeches. Then came the moment for which everyone had been waiting for. It took over three hours for Tarique to reach the reception area from the Dhaka airport. As his motorcade arrived, armed forces personnel parted the crowd. Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary general of BNP, spoke first. Then, Salahuddin Ahmed, BNP Standing Committee member, finally welcomed Rahman to the stage. Speaking at the event, he said the people of Bangladesh now want to reclaim their right to speak and restore their democratic freedoms. \"The time has come for all of us to rebuild the country together,\" he said, adding that Bangladesh belongs equally to the people of the hills and the plains, and to Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians alike. \"We want to build a safe Bangladesh where every woman, man and child can leave home and return safely.\" International media highlight Tarique Rahman's return as 'PM front-runner' Tarique did not forget to pay tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi. He said Hadi had envisioned a country where people could reclaim their economic rights. \"If we are to repay the blood debt of those martyred in 1971 and 2024, we must build the Bangladesh we all dream of,\" he said. The BNP leader said the country's future would be led by the youth and stressed the importance of establishing a democratic Bangladesh with a strong economic foundation. Drawing a parallel with Martin Luther King Jr's historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech, Tarique said, \"I have a plan.\" Amidst deafening cheers, he said that he has concrete plans to rebuild the country and that their implementation would require the cooperation of every citizen. At the reception, he also urged everyone to pray for the recovery of his mother, BNP Chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia. As the event drew to a close, the crowd slowly began to disperse, walking back towards their homes.

{"title": "Inclusive menstrual health is still missing in rural Bangladesh", "body": "In the monsoon-soaked village of Nobogram, Jhalokathi district, the narrow mud paths connecting households turn into slippery streams. For women like Rahima Begum (42), who cannot walk without support due to a childhood injury, these conditions exacerbate a struggle that comes every month: managing menstruation without support, dignity, or safety. \"Sanitary pads cost money we do not have,\" Rahima whispered, looking at a bundle of old cloths. \"Sometimes I just wait for the day to pass. My family cannot help me, and no one in the village cares.\" Rahima's story is far from isolated. Across rural Bangladesh, girls and women with disabilities face systematic neglect during menstruation. During our recent fieldwork across Jessore, Jhalokathi, Habiganj, Sirajganj, Kurigram, and Mymensingh districts, conducted as part of a study by the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), BRAC University, we met dozens of women and girls for whom menstruation had turned into a source of pain, shame, and health risk. For them, this monthly biological process is not private or simple—it is a struggle at the intersection of poverty, disability, gender, and social invisibility. Physical vulnerabilities: Navigating inaccessible environments For many women with physical, visual, or mobility impairments, menstrual hygiene management is a daily challenge of navigation and safety. Rahima struggles to reach the distant latrine along slippery paths. Amena Khatun (35), visually impaired, relies entirely on her teenage daughter to help her bathe and manage menstrual cloths. During the monsoon, the yard floods, making trips to latrines nearly impossible. Even for women with mild physical impairments, narrow, unsafe toilets, lack of private washing areas, and absence of ramps or handles create a constant risk of falls, injuries, and infections. Our fieldwork showed that over 60% of women with mobility impairments in these villages lacked accessible sanitation, forcing them to improvise, often in unhygienic conditions. WHO (2024) indicates women with disabilities are 2–3 times more likely to experience poor menstrual hygiene and face an elevated risk of infections due to physical and environmental barriers. Lack of menstrual products: Reliance on cloth Across our fieldwork, we found that almost all women and girls with disabilities relied on old cloths for menstruation. Pads were either too expensive or unavailable locally. Shathi (19), a girl with an intellectual disability, uses folded cloths that are washed and reused repeatedly. \"I cannot manage pads myself,\" she told us, her mother, Rokeya, adding, \"I try to help her, but I cannot always be there. Sometimes I leave her alone.\" Farida (28), a deaf woman, explained through gestures that she reuses cloths even when damp, because she has no access to pads and no one can explain hygienic practices in sign language. The consequences are serious: infections, rashes, and discomfort are common, and the mental strain of shame and isolation compounds the problem. For many women, menstruation becomes a period of confinement, missed household activities, and avoidance of social interactions. Over half of rural women in Bangladesh still rely on cloths for menstrual management, but for PWDs (Persons with Disabilities), the lack of support amplifies health risks and reduces dignity (UNICEF, 2023). Denial of care and family neglect A particularly alarming theme is neglect and denial of care by family members. Our fieldwork revealed that families often leave women and girls to manage menstruation alone, either due to lack of knowledge, social stigma, or perceived burden. Rahima reported that her own family rarely assists her. \"They say I am old, I should manage. I feel invisible,\" she said. Neglect is especially common for girls with intellectual or sensory disabilities. Farida, deaf since birth, described her mother leaving her to manage alone, unable to communicate the process or guide her. Women with disabilities are often doubly marginalised—by gender and disability. Denial of care increases physical risks (infection, injury) and mental health stress, including anxiety, shame, and depression. Social norms around menstruation further isolate PWD women. In Shathi's case, she is confined to her room, away from household or community activities. Rahima avoids visiting neighbours or participating in religious or social events during her period, fearing judgment. \"People in the village laugh if they see me changing my clothes,\" Rahima said. \"It is easier to just hide and wait for the days to pass.\" This isolation is compounded by disability. Women who cannot communicate easily, see, or move independently are cut off from knowledge, support, and community networks. For many, menstruation becomes a monthly experience of invisibility, shame, and neglect. Social stigma around menstruation in rural Bangladesh contributes to chronic stress, low self-esteem, and exclusion, especially for women with disabilities. Health risks and mental impacts The physical, social, and emotional vulnerabilities converge to create heightened health risks. Poor hygiene, reliance on reused cloths, inaccessible water and sanitation, and lack of caregiver support increase the risk of infections, rashes, and reproductive health complications. Mental health is also impacted. Isolation, neglect, and repeated humiliation lead to stress, anxiety, and low self-worth. Rahima said, \"I feel ashamed, invisible, and trapped. No one notices me or my struggles.\" Research supports these observations. According to WHO (2024), PWD women face higher rates of infections and mental health challenges related to menstrual neglect compared to non-disabled women. Current interventions largely focus on schoolgirls, ignoring out-of-school PWD women and girls. Toilets are inaccessible, distributions of pads are not disability-inclusive, and caregivers receive no formal guidance. Health outreach programmes rarely consider communication barriers, environmental constraints, or seasonal challenges like monsoon floods. As a result, women like Rahima, Shathi, and Farida are invisible to policymakers and service providers. Pathways for Change Addressing these vulnerabilities requires targeted, disability-inclusive interventions. One critical pathway for change is ensuring free access to menstrual products for women with disabilities. Integrating these essentials into disability allowances, community clinics, and local social protection schemes, as evidence suggests, improves hygiene and reduces infection risks. Equally important is strengthening caregiver support and training. Mothers, sisters, and other family members must receive practical guidance on safe, dignified menstrual care. Training should address privacy, hygiene, and mental well-being. Improving sanitation infrastructure is another essential step. Toilets, washing areas, and disposal mechanisms must accommodate mobility, vision, and cognitive impairments. Change also depends on shifting social attitudes. Menstruation for women with disabilities must be normalised. Families, neighbours, and leaders should be included in campaigns. Finally, health outreach must become genuinely disability-inclusive. Health workers must be trained in communication with deaf, visually impaired, and intellectually disabled women, providing guidance on hygiene, infection prevention, and mental health support. As Rahima said quietly, \"We just learn to live with it.\" But living with pain, neglect, and shame is not dignity. Menstruation is natural, and every woman, including women and girls with disabilities in rural Bangladesh, deserves safety, privacy, care, and dignity every month. Inclusive menstrual health is not charity; it is a human rights and public health imperative. Until families, communities, and policymakers acknowledge and address the vulnerabilities of women with disabilities, millions will remain invisible, enduring their struggles silently, month after month.

{"title": "Holder and Gabriel put West Indies in control", "body": "West Indies captain Jason Holder posted career-best test bowling figures with six wickets as his side dominated the second day of the first test against England on Thursday. Making full use of the murky conditions, all-rounder Holder took six for 42 and paceman Shannon Gabriel claimed four wickets as England were dismissed for 204. Ben Stokes, captaining England for the first time in the absence of Joe Root, top-scored with 43 but might be regretting his decision to bat first having won the toss. West Indies showed great discipline and rode their luck at times in reply as they reached 57-1 to put themselves in a decent position going into the third day at the Ageas Bowl when an improving weather forecast should make batting easier. James Anderson removed opener John Campbell for 28 but Kraigg Brathwaite and Shai Hope survived some express pace from Mark Wood before bad light ended the day's play. England are hosting the first international cricket-match after a 117-day absence because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-match series is being played without fans in a \"bio-secure environment\" with daily health checks, home umpires and a ban on shining the ball with saliva. England began the day on 35 for one after 17 overs were completed on Wednesday, but Gabriel struck twice in the first hour having removed Dom Sibley on day one. In the sixth over he got a 90mph delivery to nip back and splatter Joe Denly's off stump and in his next over the 32-year-old trapped Rory Burns (30) in front of his stumps with a full delivery that was given lbw on review. Stokes started confidently, pulling Gabriel to the boundary, but Zak Crawley struggled to 10 before Holder claimed his first wicket, angling one back in to strike the pad. Again the on-field umpire turned down the appeal, but Holder's decision to review proved correct. Ollie Pope looked good in reaching 12 before edging Holder to wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich. Stokes got lucky before lunch when he was dropped at long leg by Kemar Roach, hooking Alzarri Joseph, as he and Jos Buttler launched a 67-run counter-attack. The series has been touted as a battle of the world's best two all-rounders and Holder drew first blood when he induced a nick behind from Stokes to dismiss him on 43. There was more joy for Holder as Buttler got a thick edge to a peach of a delivery and Dowrich took a diving catch to leave England on 157-7. Holder trapped Jofra Archer lbw for a duck and grabbed his sixth wicket when Wood was caught at gully by Hope. Dom Bess's 31-run cameo helped England past 200 before Gabriel bowled Anderson. West Indies opener Campbell was twice reprieved off a frustrated Anderson — making it five successful reviews out of five for the visitors, before his luck finally ran out. England could make no further inroads, though, and West Indies were much the happier side when bad light stopped play.

In a different world, the next day would see a handful of students with tentative answers — the fruits of their mental labour. But in our world, tomorrow promises a very different outcome. The teacher will be met not with the hesitant hands of thinkers, but with a chorus of perfectly recited, analytically sound answers. For the night, the challenge was not wrestled with in the quiet of a student's mind; it was delegated. The question was fed into an AI model, which promptly returned the cognitive labour — pre-packaged and flawless — bypassing the very process the teacher hoped to inspire. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel The sacred contract between teacher and student — the promise that effort leads to understanding — is being broken not by malice, but by a tool of irresistible convenience. The very exercises meant to build strong, independent minds are now being completed by an artificial brain. How widespread is AI access? There is no exact data on how many students from post-primary to university level (class 6 to 12) are using AI. According to Education Statistics 2023, the total number of students in post-primary education, including secondary school education (8,166,188), school and college (1,609,738), and college education (4,631,126), amounts to roughly 1.44 crore, excluding English-medium institutions. Approximately 50% of the national population has internet access; however, not all students can utilise it effectively. If we conservatively assume that around 40% of these students have some level of access to AI tools, that gives us an approximate figure of 50-60 lakh students who could already be using AI for their studies. This leads to an apparent inequality. Students in urban areas with internet-enabled devices can rely on AI for quick answers, while a large proportion, perhaps 70%, still flip through guidebooks or struggle to make sense of creative questions without such assistance. In other words, AI has quietly created a new form of educational privilege. The illusion of learning When the creative question system was introduced in Bangladeshi schools around 2010, it was hailed as a revolutionary step. The idea was simple but powerful: move away from rote memorisation and encourage students to think critically. It was designed to nurture reasoning, analysis, and imagination. And for some years, teachers reported that students became more curious, asking \"why\" rather than just \"what.\" That assumption is now not just outdated; it is a fantasy. The genie of Generative AI is out of the bottle, and it answers \"why\" faster than any student ever could. For students, AI feels like magic. A complex math problem? Photomath solves it with a step-by-step breakdown in seconds. An essay on climate change? Written in perfect English by Claude.ai. Even Bangla literature's creative questions can be answered instantly. But this convenience is a trap. We are witnessing the great outsourcing of the thinking process itself. The student is no longer a thinker but a prompt manager, a middleman between the exam paper and the AI. The \"creative\" in the creative question now risks standing for \"creatively prompting an AI.\" The illusion of learning is complete when the student believes the answer is theirs, even though the process of arriving at it was entirely external. Rethinking the entire system The bigger issue is that our exam system assumes only the student's brain is available during preparation. That assumption is now outdated. Our learning and exam system is designed for a pre-AI world. Creative questions no longer guarantee creative answers. AI generates them instantly, often surpassing the work of most students under exam pressure. This creates an apparent mismatch. Exams are meant to measure a student's critical thinking skills, but they often end up reflecting who has access to the internet or who can craft the most effective AI prompt. Education risks shifting from personal growth to digital shortcuts. Of course, some might argue that students have always had access to guidebooks or private tutors. But even when consulting multiple books, notes, or a tutor, the student's brain was actively working through the problem. Today, with AI, that cognitive effort is partially or even entirely outsourced, leaving little room for genuine intellectual development. The future of learning starts now Using AI detection tools or forbidding students from using AI in education is no longer a viable solution. The real challenge lies in adapting our teaching and assessment systems to meet the demands of this new reality. In Bangladesh, this means rethinking how we teach and evaluate students, and how we prepare both learners and educators for an AI-integrated future. Examinations must evolve to focus on skills that emphasise reasoning, analysis, and creativity, qualities that AI cannot easily replicate. Instead of relying on rote memorisation or predictable written answers, assessments should include oral exams, spontaneous essays written in class, and collaborative presentations. These formats make it harder to rely solely on AI-generated content and encourage genuine understanding, reflection, and intellectual ownership.

{"title": "Exports slowdown to weigh on Bangladesh's growth: ADB", "body": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said that although South Asia is poised for strong economic performance, Bangladesh's growth will lag due to persistent weakness in its export sector. In its Asian Development Outlook (ADO) for December 2025, released today, the bank revised down Bangladesh's GDP growth forecast for FY26, while keeping the FY25 projection unchanged. Earlier in the September outlook, the ADB also trimmed its growth outlook for Bangladesh, forecasting the economy to expand by 5% in the current fiscal year, FY26, slightly down from its April projection of 5.1%. However, the December outlook report did not mention the revised growth figure for Bangladesh. The report mentioned, \"The lower forecast reflects weaker-than-expected export performance and greater investment uncertainty arising out of the effect on policy of upcoming national elections in February.\" \"It also reflects weaknesses in the financial sector,\" it warned. \"Exports have been weighed down not only by subdued global demand but also by supply disruptions resulting from a major strike in October at Chattogram Port, which handles more than 90% of Bangladesh's imports–exports,\" the report added. Meanwhile, growth in South Asia is expected to remain robust, with the 2025 forecast revised upward to 6.5% from 5.9%, and the 2026 forecast maintained at 6.0%. This is driven by upgrades to India's outlook based on robust growth in domestic consumption. The region's largest economy's growth forecast for FY25 (fiscal year ending March 2026) was revised to 7.2% from 6.5% in the September ADO. The inflation forecast for Bangladesh remains unchanged in the latest outlook. In its September outlook, the lender said inflation is expected to ease, averaging around 8% in the current fiscal year — down from 10% in the previous year. The latest report mentioned, \"In Bangladesh, the outlook is retained as assumptions hold for tighter monetary and fiscal policies, efforts to mitigate exchange rate volatility, and declining global commodity prices.\" ADB / export / Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/exports-slowdown-weigh-bangladeshs-growth-adb-1306041", "date": "2025-12-10T11:05:00+06:00", "author": "TBS Report 10 December, 2025, 11:05 am Last modified: 10 December, 2025, 09:38 pm", "category": "economy", "language": "en", "token_count": 318, "scraped_at": "2026-02-05T22:37:14.586854"}
