Tanvir finished with impressive figures of three for 39, while Mahedi returned two for 17. Pacers Shoriful Islam and Mukidul Islam then wrapped up the innings with two wickets apiece as Noakhali were bowled out for 109.Earlier, Chattogram named Pakistan top-order batter Mirza Tahir Baig and Afghanistan wicketkeeper-batter Masood Gurbaz in their playing XI, just managing to meet the foreign-player quota. Baig played a laborious knock as wickets fell around him, while skipper Mahedi provided late momentum with a brisk 26 off just 13 balls.Baig was dismissed off the final delivery of the innings after scoring 80 from 69 balls, as Chattogram posted 174 for six.

Rishad played a crucial role in breaking momentum at key stages, allowing the Hurricanes to keep a firm grip on the Scorchers' innings.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Introduced in the fifth over of the Powerplay, Rishad conceded nine runs in his first over after Perth opener Finn Allen struck a six. He bounced back immediately after the Powerplay, though, trapping hard-hitter Cooper Connolly (6 off seven balls) with a well-disguised googly in the seventh over. Connolly attempted a big shot over the off side but skewed the flighted delivery straight to long-off. Despite conceding a boundary off the final ball, Rishad gave away 10 runs in that over.Rishad struck again in his third over -- the 10th of the innings -- removing Aaron Hardie for nine off 10 balls. This time, he enjoyed a slice of luck as Hardie mistimed a length ball on middle and leg, offering a leading edge that was safely taken at short fine leg. Only four runs came from that over.With Perth eyeing a late surge through Nick Hobson (22 off 14 balls) and Laurie Evans (19 off 15 balls), and the score reading 123 for five after 15 overs, Rishad was brought back to bowl at the death. After conceding a couple and a six off his first two balls of the 16th over, he responded with flight and guile, luring Evans, who made 27 off 18 balls, into a stumping. The remaining deliveries of the over yielded just two runs.Allen's team-highest 43 off 23 balls and Hobson's eventual 29 off 23 helped Perth reach 150 for eight. Hobart, however, made light work of the chase as Tim David smashed 42 off 28 balls and Macalister Wright added a brisk 22 off 13 deliveries. After a slower 30 off 34 balls from Nikhil Chaudhury, the Hurricanes crossed the line in 19.3 overs.The win was Hobart's third in four matches, placing them second on the standings with six points, behind Melbourne Stars (on net run rate), who have three wins from three games.Rishad now has six wickets from four matches this season, conceding runs at an economy rate of 7.50.Related topic:Big Bash LeagueBBLRishad Hossainbangladesh cricketHobart HurricanesClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsPakistan wants ICC to regulate growth of T20 leagues3y agoICC WTC 2025–27: Where each team stand as the race heats up3d agoRishad ‘regrets misunderstanding’ caused by his comments on PSL teammates7m agoTigers eye gains from ‘different’ skill camp1w agoCurran handed four-match Big Bash ban for intimidating umpire2y ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

Photo: AFPMohamed Salah scored as 10-man Egypt beat South Africa 1-0 in Agadir on Friday to become the first qualifiers for the knockout stage of the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.The Liverpool star converted a penalty on 45 minutes, and South Africa were denied a spot-kick late in the second half when Yasser Ibrahim appeared to handle the ball inside the box.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Salah came to Morocco after not starting in five Liverpool matches -- his omission leading to an outburst against manager Arne Slot.Egypt were reduced to 10 men in first-half added time when right-back Mohamed Hany was shown a second yellow card for a stamp, followed by a red.After two rounds in Group B, record seven-time champions Egypt have six points and are guaranteed a top-two finish and a place in the round of 16.South Africa have three points, and Angola and Zimbabwe one each after they drew 1-1 in Marrakesh earlier.The first chance fell to Salah after 11 minutes, but he could not move forward quickly enough to connect with a low cross from Hany.That the majority of the crowd were supporting the Pharaohs became obvious soon after when the Burundi referee ignored Zizo appeals for a free-kick, and loud whistling enveloped the stadium.When Salah delivered a free-kick into the heart of the South African area, three Egyptians darted forward, but none could connect with the ball.Midway through the opening half a pattern had developed -- Egypt were pushing forward regularly while South Africa defended with calmness and solid tackling.Salah closely policedWhen Teboho Mokoena fouled Omar Marmoush just outside the D, he was yellow carded. However, the Manchester City striker fired the resultant free-kick wide.As the first half progressed the sun broke out in the southern coastal city -- a welcome sight for players and spectators with many earlier group matches staged in torrential rain.A rare South Africa attack ended disappointingly as Lyle Foster struck a weak shot that was comfortably saved by 37-year-old Mohamed El Shenawy.Awarded a free-kick close to the touchline, South Africa performed an intricate, multi-pass move that ended tamely as El Shenawy clutched a cross.Salah was being closely policed by Aubrey Modiba and as half-time drew near the Liverpool star retreated into the Egyptian half in order to retain possession.Then, as the Egypt captain chased a loose ball with Khuliso Mudau, the South African right-back raised his left arm, striking the left eye of Salah.Amid Egyptian protests, the Burundian referee viewed the incident on a VAR monitor and pointed to the penalty spot.A lengthy delay before the kick was taken could not have eased the nerves of Salah, but he comfortably converted the penalty as Ronwen Williams dived in the wrong direction.More drama erupted in added time when Hany stamped on Mokoena, leading to a second yellow card for the defender.South Africa, with a numerical advantage, attacked more as the second half progressed, but Egypt came close to a second goal with Williams foiling substitute Emam Ashour after a quick free-kick.El Shenawy displayed his agility with 15 minutes remaining, using his right hand to tip to safety a low shot from Foster. It was one of several saves that kept Egypt ahead.Related topic:Mohamed SalahLiverpoolPLEPLPremier LeagueEgypt footballSouth AfricaAfrica Cup of Nations 2026Click to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsPL talking points: Arsenal lead narrows, Salah fumes, Everton eye Europe2w agoPakistan beat South Africa by 93 runs in first Test2m agoMy grandfather encouraged me to play for Algeria, Luca Zidane says1d agoSalah apologised to Liverpool teammates after explosive interview, Jones reveals6d agoLiverpool fear Isak has broken leg4d ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

However, the Manchester City striker fired the resultant free-kick wide.As the first half progressed the sun broke out in the southern coastal city -- a welcome sight for players and spectators with many earlier group matches staged in torrential rain.A rare South Africa attack ended disappointingly as Lyle Foster struck a weak shot that was comfortably saved by 37-year-old Mohamed El Shenawy.Awarded a free-kick close to the touchline, South Africa performed an intricate, multi-pass move that ended tamely as El Shenawy clutched a cross.Salah was being closely policed by Aubrey Modiba and as half-time drew near the Liverpool star retreated into the Egyptian half in order to retain possession.Then, as the Egypt captain chased a loose ball with Khuliso Mudau, the South African right-back raised his left arm, striking the left eye of Salah.Amid Egyptian protests, the Burundian referee viewed the incident on a VAR monitor and pointed to the penalty spot.A lengthy delay before the kick was taken could not have eased the nerves of Salah, but he comfortably converted the penalty as Ronwen Williams dived in the wrong direction.More drama erupted in added time when Hany stamped on Mokoena, leading to a second yellow card for the defender.South Africa, with a numerical advantage, attacked more as the second half progressed, but Egypt came close to a second goal with Williams foiling substitute Emam Ashour after a quick free-kick.El Shenawy displayed his agility with 15 minutes remaining, using his right hand to tip to safety a low shot from Foster. It was one of several saves that kept Egypt ahead.Related topic:Mohamed SalahLiverpoolPLEPLPremier LeagueEgypt footballSouth AfricaAfrica Cup of Nations 2026Click to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsPL talking points: Arsenal lead narrows, Salah fumes, Everton eye Europe2w agoPakistan beat South Africa by 93 runs in first Test2m agoMy grandfather encouraged me to play for Algeria, Luca Zidane says1d agoSalah apologised to Liverpool teammates after explosive interview, Jones reveals6d agoLiverpool fear Isak has broken leg4d ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে FootballAFP, AgadirFri Dec 26, 2025 11:21 PMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 11:26 PMMost Viewed'This country belongs to people of the hills and plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians'Tarique Rahman returns home after 17 years in exileA psychological reset for BNP, a moment of political recalibration for BangladeshZubaida, daughter Zaima reach Gulshan residenceFootballFootballSalah helps Egypt beat South Africa and book last-16 placeFri Dec 26, 2025 11:21 PMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 11:26 PMAFP, AgadirFri Dec 26, 2025 11:21 PM      Last update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 11:26 PMEgypt's forward #10 Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring the team's first goal from a penalty during the Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) Group B football match between Egypt and South Africa at Adrar Stadium in Agadir on December 26, 2025.

The takeover followed the withdrawal of Triangle Services Limited, which cited financial constraints in relinquishing the franchise rights.Sources said efforts are underway to recruit more overseas players for upcoming matches.By naming two foreign players, Chattogram avoided a repeat of last season's controversy when Durbar Rajshahi were forced to play without any overseas players against Rangpur Riders due to payment disputes. On that occasion, the BPL Technical Committee allowed Rajshahi to field an all-local XI under clause 1.2.8, which permits exceptions for \"valid reasons\".In contrast, Noakhali Express fielded the full quota of four foreign players -- Maaz Sadaqat, Haider Ali, Zahir Khan, and Ihsanullah.

The opener between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans also saw all eight overseas slots filled.Related topic:Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Chattogram RoyalsBPLClick to commentCommentsComments Policy Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:16 PMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:20 PM Sports ReporterFri Dec 26, 2025 09:16 PM      Last update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:20 PM Related topic:Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Chattogram RoyalsBPL Related topic:Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Chattogram RoyalsBPL Click to comment   Related NewsAll eyes on foreign players as transfer window closes4m agoBPL 2024 fever tunes up with existing and new artistes12m agoBPL franchises gear up for auction on November 304w agoBCB tightens integrity rules ahead of BPL 122w agoBPL 2026: Let the errors begin!3w ago All eyes on foreign players as transfer window closes4m ago BPL 2024 fever tunes up with existing and new artistes12m ago BPL franchises gear up for auction on November 304w ago BCB tightens integrity rules ahead of BPL 122w ago BPL 2026: Let the errors begin!3w ago |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে |রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে     About UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives  ",

Photo: BCBNajmul Hossain Shanto's magnificent century set the tone for the 12th edition of the Bangladesh Premier League as Rajshahi Warriors opened their campaign with a commanding eight-wicket victory over Sylhet Titans at a packed Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Friday.Shanto produced an unbeaten 101 off 60 balls, smashing 10 fours and five sixes, and forged an unbroken 130-run partnership off just 71 deliveries with Mushfiqur Rahim. The veteran campaigner remained not out on 51 from 31 balls as Rajshahi reached 192 for two in 19.4 overs.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Earlier, Sylhet Titans posted a competitive 190 for five after being asked to bat. Parvez Hossain Emon led the charge with an unbeaten 65 off 33 balls, while Rony Talukdar contributed 41 and Afif Hossain added 33.Rajshahi's chase got off to a shaky start as they lost both openers early. Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Pakistani recruit Sahibzada Farhan managed just 10 and 20, respectively, leaving the side struggling at 62 for two in 7.5 overs.From there on, it was all Shanto. The Rajshahi skipper took complete control of the chase, peppering the boundaries with authority and composure. He brought up his second BPL century, joining Tamim Iqbal and Tanzid Hasan as the only Bangladeshis to score multiple hundreds in the tournament's history.Mushfiqur provided ideal support at the other end and sealed the victory in style by striking the winning boundary off pacer Ruyel Miah, which also completed his half-century.Earlier with the ball, Rajshahi pacer Binura Fernando struck the first blow by dismissing Saim Ayub for 28 off 15 balls. Sandeep Lamichchane (2-38) then removed Rony and Hazratullah Zazai (20) to reduce Sylhet to 104 for three in the 13th over.However, Emon and Afif counter-attacked with an 85-run stand off just 41 balls to lift Sylhet to a challenging total -- an effort that ultimately proved insufficient against Shanto's brilliance.The tournament was formally inaugurated before the match by Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul. A minute's silence was also observed in memory of the late Sharif Osman Hadi, a youth activist and July uprising leader.Related topic:BPL 12Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Najmul Hossain ShantoMushfiqur RahimRajshahi WarriorsSylhet TitansClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsStats paint grim picture as Bangladesh's white-ball woes continue5m agoMushfiqur pays heartfelt tribute to Shuvo on retirement2w agoBPL franchises gear up for auction on November 304w agoBCB takes over Chattogram franchise after owner’s withdrawal letter1d agoBCB tightens integrity rules ahead of BPL 122w ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

A minute's silence was also observed in memory of the late Sharif Osman Hadi, a youth activist and July uprising leader.Related topic:BPL 12Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Najmul Hossain ShantoMushfiqur RahimRajshahi WarriorsSylhet TitansClick to commentCommentsComments Policy Fri Dec 26, 2025 07:21 PMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 07:34 PM Sports ReporterFri Dec 26, 2025 07:21 PM      Last update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 07:34 PM Related topic:BPL 12Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Najmul Hossain ShantoMushfiqur RahimRajshahi WarriorsSylhet Titans Related topic:BPL 12Bangladesh Premier League (BPL)Najmul Hossain ShantoMushfiqur RahimRajshahi WarriorsSylhet Titans Click to comment   Related NewsStats paint grim picture as Bangladesh's white-ball woes continue5m agoMushfiqur pays heartfelt tribute to Shuvo on retirement2w agoBPL franchises gear up for auction on November 304w agoBCB takes over Chattogram franchise after owner’s withdrawal letter1d agoBCB tightens integrity rules ahead of BPL 122w ago Stats paint grim picture as Bangladesh's white-ball woes continue5m ago Mushfiqur pays heartfelt tribute to Shuvo on retirement2w ago BPL franchises gear up for auction on November 304w ago BCB takes over Chattogram franchise after owner’s withdrawal letter1d ago BCB tightens integrity rules ahead of BPL 122w ago |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে |রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে     About UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives  ",

While the proposed dismantling of the controversial National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre (NTMC) is a long-awaited and widely supported step, its replacement with a body vested with nearly identical powers and under similar government control renders the reform largely superficial. Under the ordinance, a new entity, called the Centre for Information Support (CIS), would be established within the home ministry, effectively continuing the NTMC's role as an intelligence-gathering arm of the state responsible for internal security and law enforcement.Reports indicate that the ordinance introduces a three-member \"quasi-judicial council\" tasked with reviewing, approving, amending, or rejecting interception requests. However, as the council is to be chaired by the minister of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, and will include the principal staff officer as well as the secretary of the home ministry as members, the ordinance effectively expands the government's ability to deploy surveillance against its citizens. It is difficult to believe that such a body could operate independently, free from political or institutional influence.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.For years, the NTMC has faced criticism for alleged human rights violations and for facilitating illegal and unregulated surveillance, including enforced disappearances carried out by various security and law enforcement agencies. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has also documented the NTMC's involvement in several such cases in detail. Yet the new draft ordinance largely overlooks concerns repeatedly raised by human rights defenders. Expecting aggrieved individuals to seek redress through a so-called quasi-judicial council composed of senior government officials is neither convincing nor reassuring.Although the ordinance includes some positive measures—such as banning internet shutdowns and criminalising unauthorised interception, data collection, retention, and misuse—it still falls far short of meaningful reform that aligns with international human rights obligations. Provisions promoting transparency in interception approvals and requiring council decisions to be auditable are commendable. However, so long as the government retains full control over the oversight mechanism, these measures risk becoming ineffectual. The replacement of the NTMC, coupled with the expanded scope of surveillance and weakened accountability in the approved draft, requires urgent reconsideration.A genuinely independent oversight body with quasi-judicial authority can only exist when government functionaries are excluded from its composition. The original proposal—calling for one representative nominated by the president, one by the prime minister, and one by the speaker of parliament, alongside a retired High Court Division judge and a retired district and sessions judge—should be reinstated. Without such safeguards, the CIS risks becoming not a reform but a regression, potentially even more concerning than the NTMC it seeks to replace.Related topic:Bangladesh Telecommunication (Amendment) OrdinanceNational Telecommunication Monitoring Centre (NTMC)Click to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsWhat about citizens' right to privacy?2y agoNTMC will soon be able to block anti-govt propaganda6y agoAn alarming lapse in data security protocols1y agoCitizen data server?

FILE PHOTO: RAJIB RAIHANRecently,  Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) has reported its highest net profit in 54 years, an achievement that has understandably generated optimism among policymakers and maritime stakeholders. After decades of operating largely at a loss, the corporation's return to profitability feels like a long-awaited vindication. Riding on this momentum, the government has signalled its intention to procure new vessels for BSC, with the stated goals of carrying more national cargo, saving foreign exchange, and creating seafaring jobs.While these objectives are valid and important, the policy direction chosen to achieve them deserves careful scrutiny. Shipping is one of the most volatile and capital-intensive industries in the global economy. Decisions taken during a cyclical upswing can lock a country into long-term financial and operational risks long after favourable market conditions have faded.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.BSC's recent profit, though welcome, must be seen in its proper context. Global freight rates surged unusually in the aftermath of the pandemic due to supply chain disruptions, port congestion, and vessel shortages. This exceptional market environment benefited shipowners worldwide, not just BSC. In Bangladesh's case, part of the reported profit also stemmed from one-off factors rather than recurring operational efficiency. A single profitable year, particularly after more than five decades of losses, does not automatically indicate a structural turnaround or long-term competitiveness.Shipping history offers sobering lessons. Freight markets are cyclical by nature. Periods of high earnings are often followed by sharp downturns, during which revenues fall rapidly while fixed costs—loan repayments, crew wages, insurance, and maintenance—remain unchanged. Even globally renowned shipping companies, backed by modern fleets and professional management, have gone bankrupt when market cycles turned against them. Publicly funded shipping ventures are especially vulnerable because their losses ultimately fall on taxpayers.Over the past three decades, most developed maritime nations have drawn clear conclusions from these realities. Governments gradually stepped away from owning and operating commercial shipping lines, not due to ideological preference, but because state ownership proved ill-suited to an industry that demands speed, flexibility, and ruthless cost discipline. Former national flag carriers in Europe and Asia were privatised, merged, or allowed to be acquired by larger private operators once it became clear that emotional attachment to national ownership could not outweigh commercial logic.Bangladesh's own maritime trajectory reinforces this global lesson. The country already has a growing private shipping sector operating dozens of ocean-going vessels without sovereign guarantees or exclusive cargo privileges. Several private groups today operate fleets far larger than BSC's, demonstrating that local entrepreneurship, when given policy stability and market access, can compete internationally. Expanding state ownership risks crowding out this private capacity rather than complementing it.There is also a structural concern about market distortion. When government cargo or regulatory advantages are reserved for a state-owned entity, private investment incentives weaken. Such policies also do not encourage competition and efficiency, undermining the very national capacity policymakers seek to build.One of the most frequently cited justifications for expanding BSC's fleet is the need to create jobs for Bangladeshi seafarers. This concern is genuine, but purchasing ships is neither the most efficient nor the most scalable solution. Each vessel creates a limited number of onboard positions while requiring enormous capital outlay. Meanwhile, thousands of maritime graduates struggle to secure practical sea time not because global opportunities are absent, but because structured pathways to international employment remain weak. As I have argued in a previous article, the core challenge lies in training quality, international accreditation, and placement mechanisms—not in the number of state-owned ships.Countries such as the Philippines became global leaders in seafarer employment without owning a large national merchant fleet. They invested instead in internationally trusted training systems and global placement networks, enabling their mariners to serve across the world's commercial fleets. Bangladesh could follow a similar path, generating foreign exchange and employment at a fraction of the cost of buying ships.Another overlooked risk is the long-term financial burden of fleet ownership. Ships depreciate, require periodic dry-docking, and eventually must be replaced. These costs do not pause during market downturn. If freight rates decline or operational inefficiencies emerge, BSC may find itself unable to service debt without renewed government support. Bangladesh's experience with other state-owned enterprises should caution against assuming that shipping will be different.A more sustainable vision for maritime strength lies in policy reform rather than asset accumulation. As I have argued in another article published in this daily, expanding Bangladesh's presence through an internationally competitive registry and public-private partnership model could deliver broader benefits than state ownership alone.Many of the world's most successful maritime nations generate revenue, jobs, and influence by hosting ships under their flag rather than owning them outright. Such models allow governments to regulate standards, earn income, and promote national seafarer employment without bearing full commercial risk.Bangladesh is also investing heavily in ports, logistics corridors, and energy infrastructure. These assets can anchor a strong maritime ecosystem if supported by the right policies. A competitive port system, efficient customs processes, access to ship finance, and skilled human capital will attract shipping activity far more reliably than a state-owned fleet operating in isolation.None of this suggests that BSC has no role to play. The corporation can serve as a strategic participant, a benchmark for standards, or a partner in specific national interests. But expansion should be cautious, phased, and firmly grounded in commercial viability rather than short-term profitability. Any further fleet growth should be accompanied by strict governance reforms, transparent performance benchmarks, and a clear exit strategy if market conditions turn unfavourable.Shipping ambition must be guided by prudence. Profits earned during exceptional market conditions should prompt strategic reflection, not momentum-driven commitments. Public investment decisions in shipping are not easily reversible, and mistakes can linger for decades.Bangladesh's maritime future will be strongest if it is built on competitiveness, private sector vitality, and globally employable human capital. One profitable year is worth celebrating, yes, but it should not decide the country's shipping destiny.Ahamedul Karim Chowdhuryis adjunct faculty at Bangladesh Maritime University and former head of the Kamalapur Inland Container Depot (ICD) and the Pangaon Inland Container Terminal under Chittagong Port Authority.Views expressed in this article are the author's own.FollowThe Daily Star Opinion on Facebookfor the latest opinions, commentaries, and analyses by experts and professionals.

Expanding state ownership risks crowding out this private capacity rather than complementing it.There is also a structural concern about market distortion. When government cargo or regulatory advantages are reserved for a state-owned entity, private investment incentives weaken. Such policies also do not encourage competition and efficiency, undermining the very national capacity policymakers seek to build.One of the most frequently cited justifications for expanding BSC's fleet is the need to create jobs for Bangladeshi seafarers. This concern is genuine, but purchasing ships is neither the most efficient nor the most scalable solution. Each vessel creates a limited number of onboard positions while requiring enormous capital outlay. Meanwhile, thousands of maritime graduates struggle to secure practical sea time not because global opportunities are absent, but because structured pathways to international employment remain weak. As I have argued in a previous article, the core challenge lies in training quality, international accreditation, and placement mechanisms—not in the number of state-owned ships.Countries such as the Philippines became global leaders in seafarer employment without owning a large national merchant fleet. They invested instead in internationally trusted training systems and global placement networks, enabling their mariners to serve across the world's commercial fleets. Bangladesh could follow a similar path, generating foreign exchange and employment at a fraction of the cost of buying ships.Another overlooked risk is the long-term financial burden of fleet ownership. Ships depreciate, require periodic dry-docking, and eventually must be replaced. These costs do not pause during market downturn. If freight rates decline or operational inefficiencies emerge, BSC may find itself unable to service debt without renewed government support. Bangladesh's experience with other state-owned enterprises should caution against assuming that shipping will be different.A more sustainable vision for maritime strength lies in policy reform rather than asset accumulation. As I have argued in another article published in this daily, expanding Bangladesh's presence through an internationally competitive registry and public-private partnership model could deliver broader benefits than state ownership alone.Many of the world's most successful maritime nations generate revenue, jobs, and influence by hosting ships under their flag rather than owning them outright. Such models allow governments to regulate standards, earn income, and promote national seafarer employment without bearing full commercial risk.Bangladesh is also investing heavily in ports, logistics corridors, and energy infrastructure. These assets can anchor a strong maritime ecosystem if supported by the right policies. A competitive port system, efficient customs processes, access to ship finance, and skilled human capital will attract shipping activity far more reliably than a state-owned fleet operating in isolation.None of this suggests that BSC has no role to play. The corporation can serve as a strategic participant, a benchmark for standards, or a partner in specific national interests. But expansion should be cautious, phased, and firmly grounded in commercial viability rather than short-term profitability. Any further fleet growth should be accompanied by strict governance reforms, transparent performance benchmarks, and a clear exit strategy if market conditions turn unfavourable.Shipping ambition must be guided by prudence. Profits earned during exceptional market conditions should prompt strategic reflection, not momentum-driven commitments. Public investment decisions in shipping are not easily reversible, and mistakes can linger for decades.Bangladesh's maritime future will be strongest if it is built on competitiveness, private sector vitality, and globally employable human capital.

FILE PHOTO: RAJIB RAIHANRecently,  Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) has reported its highest net profit in 54 years, an achievement that has understandably generated optimism among policymakers and maritime stakeholders. After decades of operating largely at a loss, the corporation's return to profitability feels like a long-awaited vindication. Riding on this momentum, the government has signalled its intention to procure new vessels for BSC, with the stated goals of carrying more national cargo, saving foreign exchange, and creating seafaring jobs.While these objectives are valid and important, the policy direction chosen to achieve them deserves careful scrutiny. Shipping is one of the most volatile and capital-intensive industries in the global economy. Decisions taken during a cyclical upswing can lock a country into long-term financial and operational risks long after favourable market conditions have faded.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.BSC's recent profit, though welcome, must be seen in its proper context. Global freight rates surged unusually in the aftermath of the pandemic due to supply chain disruptions, port congestion, and vessel shortages. This exceptional market environment benefited shipowners worldwide, not just BSC. In Bangladesh's case, part of the reported profit also stemmed from one-off factors rather than recurring operational efficiency. A single profitable year, particularly after more than five decades of losses, does not automatically indicate a structural turnaround or long-term competitiveness.Shipping history offers sobering lessons. Freight markets are cyclical by nature. Periods of high earnings are often followed by sharp downturns, during which revenues fall rapidly while fixed costs—loan repayments, crew wages, insurance, and maintenance—remain unchanged. Even globally renowned shipping companies, backed by modern fleets and professional management, have gone bankrupt when market cycles turned against them. Publicly funded shipping ventures are especially vulnerable because their losses ultimately fall on taxpayers.Over the past three decades, most developed maritime nations have drawn clear conclusions from these realities. Governments gradually stepped away from owning and operating commercial shipping lines, not due to ideological preference, but because state ownership proved ill-suited to an industry that demands speed, flexibility, and ruthless cost discipline. Former national flag carriers in Europe and Asia were privatised, merged, or allowed to be acquired by larger private operators once it became clear that emotional attachment to national ownership could not outweigh commercial logic.Bangladesh's own maritime trajectory reinforces this global lesson. The country already has a growing private shipping sector operating dozens of ocean-going vessels without sovereign guarantees or exclusive cargo privileges. Several private groups today operate fleets far larger than BSC's, demonstrating that local entrepreneurship, when given policy stability and market access, can compete internationally. Expanding state ownership risks crowding out this private capacity rather than complementing it.There is also a structural concern about market distortion. When government cargo or regulatory advantages are reserved for a state-owned entity, private investment incentives weaken.

(January 1, 1930-December 20, 2025)On December 20, 2025, Bangladesh lost Bir Uttam Abdul Karim Khandker, Liberation War deputy chief of staff and the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force. His death is not only the passing of a decorated officer; it is the loss of a living bridge to the Liberation War. With him goes a voice that carried memory, discipline, and moral weight from 1971 into our uncertain present.AK Khandker belonged to a generation that chose risk and duty over fear. When the country needed structure, he helped build it. When the war demanded courage with restraint, he offered both. His leadership was not loud, but it was firm. In a time when survival itself was unsure, he believed that victory had to be organised, ethical, and rooted in service to the people.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.As the deputy commander, his role went beyond command during the war. He helped coordinate, plan, and sustain a resistance that was often outmatched in resources but not in resolve. On December 16, 1971, he was present during the Pakistani forces' surrender at the Race Course Maidan as the representative of Bangladesh. The Liberation War was won not just by the courage of millions but also by leaders like him who could think clearly under pressure and turn scattered bravery into collective strength. AK Khandker was one of those leaders.After independence, his responsibility did not end. As the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force, he faced a mammoth task—building an institution from almost nothing. It demands patience, vision, and integrity. He helped shape the Bangladesh Air Force as a professional body grounded in discipline rather than politics, and service rather than spectacle—standards still relevant. He also served as a diplomat, and became the planning minister after being elected to parliament from Pabna-2 constituency in 2009.What makes his passing especially heavy is the time we are living in. Our public life is often noisy, divided, and impatient. We speak of development, reform, and national pride, yet we rarely pause to listen to those who built the foundations we stand on. AK Khandker represented an increasingly rare leadership. He believed that power should be accountable, that institutions should outlast individuals, and that patriotism is measured by service, not slogans.His life also reminds us that the Liberation War was not a single moment frozen in textbooks. It was a process, filled with hard choices and moral tests. Leaders like AK Khandker carried those lessons forward. They understood that independence was not an ending. It was a beginning that required constant care. When such figures leave us, the risk is not only forgetting their names, but forgetting the values they lived by.We often say that we honour our freedom fighters. But honour is more than ceremony. It is the willingness to protect institutions, reject violence as a political tool, and value competence over loyalty. It is the courage to defend truth even when it is inconvenient. These were principles that shaped AK Khandker's public life.As the nation mourns him, we should ask ourselves what we are doing with the inheritance he and his peers left behind. Are we strengthening the republic they imagined, or are we slowly eroding it through neglect and short-term thinking? Are we building leaders who see power as responsibility or as entitlement?AK Khandker's death marks the fading of a generation that knew the cost of freedom firsthand. With each such loss, the distance between us and 1971 grows wider. That distance makes memory fragile. It makes distortion easier. It makes duty feel optional. That is why remembering him matters.We have lost a leader and a frontliner of the Liberation War. But we still have a choice. We can let his legacy become a line in history, or we can let it guide our conduct. If we choose the latter, then his life will continue to speak, quietly but firmly, to a nation that still needs its compass.K. M.

FILE PHOTO: HABIBUR RAHMANRecent reports on the southern coast describe an alarming breakdown in dry-season farming. In Chitalmari, Fakirhat, Rampal and Mollahat, land was ploughed and prepared for Boro paddy as it has been for decades, but irrigation pumps could not supply freshwater. Salinity had crept into canals that once sustained winter cultivation, leaving seedlings to dry on nursery beds. With no cyclone damage or embankment breach to blame, farmers faced a quieter failure: irrigation systems rendered useless by brackish water. Some abandoned planting altogether; others shifted to cultivating Bagda shrimp as the only viable way to salvage the season.When salinity rises, the soil creates a condition agronomists call physiological drought: salt increases osmotic pressure around plant roots, preventing crops from absorbing moisture even when fields appear wet. Seedlings stand surrounded by water they cannot drink. The failure is invisible to the eye, but fatal to the crop.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.In recent years, coastal districts have lost nearly 50,000 hectares of cultivable land to salinity. Salt does not announce itself through catastrophe. It enters quietly—an inch of tide here, a dry monsoon there, a river slightly less generous than before—until the soil forgets how to hold rice. Farmers rarely meet this with protest; they adapt by turning to shrimp.Shrimp aquaculture generates income where paddy fades. In one season alone, shrimp exports from a single district exceeded Tk 700 crore—attractive in economic terms. Yet profitability cannot disguise a deeper exchange: shrimp contributes to export earnings, while rice secures nourishment. When one replaces the other, income may continue, but food security shifts. Soil that converts to shrimp ponds rarely returns to rice; salinity lingers.This quiet transformation is not local or isolated. Salinity is already redrawing coastlines and harvest patterns worldwide. The Mekong Delta has begun losing rice for the same reason, with tides pushing upriver millimetres by millimetres. The Nile Delta is gradually surrendering to the Mediterranean, and in the Indus Basin, salinity has challenged yields for decades. The UN estimates that over 1.4 billion hectares of farmland globally are now salt-affected—nearly 10 percent of the world's cultivated base. Hunger arrives slowly, not through famine but erosion.Even the world's most engineered agricultural economies face similar pressures. In the Netherlands, where one-third of the country sits below sea level, food security is implemented through water governance—dikes, polders, saline-tolerant breeding programmes—designed to prevent losing ground. Australia treats salinity as an economic threat; more than two million hectares remain affected despite decades of investment, mapping, and recovery programmes. In California's Central Valley, groundwater depletion has triggered a salinity shift, forcing farmers from almonds towards pistachios and other drought-tolerant grains. Across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), governments have responded to signs of salinity stress with research funding, soil restoration, crop insurance, and irrigation reform.These comparisons matter because they shift the discussion from misfortune to management. If high-capacity nations treat soil salinity as a strategic threat, coastal agriculture in Bangladesh cannot afford to treat it as a slow inconvenience.There are still paths forward for Bangladesh. Along the western coast of India, farmers have cultivated Pokkali rice—a salt-tolerant indigenous variety—for over three thousand years. During lower-salinity months, they grow rice; when the tide turns brackish, they shift to prawn cultivation by opening and closing sluice gates with the tide and moon. They do not abandon paddy for shrimp. They alternate them, preventing soil from choosing one future permanently.Research in Bangladesh has also produced resources worth using. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) has developed multiple salinity-tolerant rice varieties. Their potential remains mostly theoretical until seeds reach farmers' hands at scale—innovation is not measured by laboratory success, but by germination in real soil.The danger ahead is not only environmental; it is generational. If rice cultivation no longer sustains dignity or income, the children of farmers will not remain farmers. Land may stay fertile on paper, yet unused in practice. Soil security depends not only on water and seeds, but on the faith that farming still has a future.Meanwhile, urban progress speaks loudly through structures that reach into the sky—flyovers, expressways, power plants, megaprojects—and each ribbon-cutting is celebrated as an achievement. But concrete does not feed families. A functioning irrigation channel receives no ceremony, though without it every new expressway ultimately leads to a place where nothing grows. Economic growth may continue for a time even as agriculture declines, but eventually the imbalance reveals itself at the dinner table rather than in budget documents.The steps we need to overcome and manage the problem are neither mysterious nor unreachable. Irrigation infrastructure must be funded, maintained, and governed with the same seriousness applied to the power or transport sector. Shrimp expansion needs zoning rather than market momentum. Salinity-tolerant rice seeds should be distributed widely, supported by services that help farmers manage new methods, not left isolated in trial plots. River dredging must be ongoing rather than intermittent, recognising that rivers are agricultural arteries. Crop insurance, procurement pricing, and credit support must sustain the farmers who hold the food system in their hands.A half-century ago, the threat was famine, and agriculture recovered through research, extension, cooperation, and resilience. Flood, cyclone, and the pressure of population did not break food security then. But, salinity may, if allowed to proceed unchallenged. It does not uproot houses or break embankments; it waits, season after season, until fields go quiet.A nation may grow economically while allowing cultivable land to slip into export ponds, but it becomes dependent. Food security is not achieved through ports, highways, or megaprojects; it is achieved when water reaches the fields and seed meets soil. No country retains full strength if it cannot feed itself, and whether that foundation is protected or allowed to erode will determine not just the next harvest but the country's long-term resilience.Dr Abdullah A Dewanis professor emeritus of economics at Eastern Michigan University in the US, and a former physicist and nuclear engineer of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission.

Salt does not announce itself through catastrophe. It enters quietly—an inch of tide here, a dry monsoon there, a river slightly less generous than before—until the soil forgets how to hold rice. Farmers rarely meet this with protest; they adapt by turning to shrimp.Shrimp aquaculture generates income where paddy fades. In one season alone, shrimp exports from a single district exceeded Tk 700 crore—attractive in economic terms. Yet profitability cannot disguise a deeper exchange: shrimp contributes to export earnings, while rice secures nourishment. When one replaces the other, income may continue, but food security shifts. Soil that converts to shrimp ponds rarely returns to rice; salinity lingers.This quiet transformation is not local or isolated. Salinity is already redrawing coastlines and harvest patterns worldwide. The Mekong Delta has begun losing rice for the same reason, with tides pushing upriver millimetres by millimetres. The Nile Delta is gradually surrendering to the Mediterranean, and in the Indus Basin, salinity has challenged yields for decades. The UN estimates that over 1.4 billion hectares of farmland globally are now salt-affected—nearly 10 percent of the world's cultivated base. Hunger arrives slowly, not through famine but erosion.Even the world's most engineered agricultural economies face similar pressures. In the Netherlands, where one-third of the country sits below sea level, food security is implemented through water governance—dikes, polders, saline-tolerant breeding programmes—designed to prevent losing ground. Australia treats salinity as an economic threat; more than two million hectares remain affected despite decades of investment, mapping, and recovery programmes. In California's Central Valley, groundwater depletion has triggered a salinity shift, forcing farmers from almonds towards pistachios and other drought-tolerant grains. Across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), governments have responded to signs of salinity stress with research funding, soil restoration, crop insurance, and irrigation reform.These comparisons matter because they shift the discussion from misfortune to management. If high-capacity nations treat soil salinity as a strategic threat, coastal agriculture in Bangladesh cannot afford to treat it as a slow inconvenience.There are still paths forward for Bangladesh. Along the western coast of India, farmers have cultivated Pokkali rice—a salt-tolerant indigenous variety—for over three thousand years. During lower-salinity months, they grow rice; when the tide turns brackish, they shift to prawn cultivation by opening and closing sluice gates with the tide and moon. They do not abandon paddy for shrimp. They alternate them, preventing soil from choosing one future permanently.Research in Bangladesh has also produced resources worth using. Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) has developed multiple salinity-tolerant rice varieties. Their potential remains mostly theoretical until seeds reach farmers' hands at scale—innovation is not measured by laboratory success, but by germination in real soil.The danger ahead is not only environmental; it is generational. If rice cultivation no longer sustains dignity or income, the children of farmers will not remain farmers. Land may stay fertile on paper, yet unused in practice. Soil security depends not only on water and seeds, but on the faith that farming still has a future.Meanwhile, urban progress speaks loudly through structures that reach into the sky—flyovers, expressways, power plants, megaprojects—and each ribbon-cutting is celebrated as an achievement. But concrete does not feed families. A functioning irrigation channel receives no ceremony, though without it every new expressway ultimately leads to a place where nothing grows. Economic growth may continue for a time even as agriculture declines, but eventually the imbalance reveals itself at the dinner table rather than in budget documents.The steps we need to overcome and manage the problem are neither mysterious nor unreachable. Irrigation infrastructure must be funded, maintained, and governed with the same seriousness applied to the power or transport sector. Shrimp expansion needs zoning rather than market momentum. Salinity-tolerant rice seeds should be distributed widely, supported by services that help farmers manage new methods, not left isolated in trial plots. River dredging must be ongoing rather than intermittent, recognising that rivers are agricultural arteries. Crop insurance, procurement pricing, and credit support must sustain the farmers who hold the food system in their hands.A half-century ago, the threat was famine, and agriculture recovered through research, extension, cooperation, and resilience. Flood, cyclone, and the pressure of population did not break food security then. But, salinity may, if allowed to proceed unchallenged. It does not uproot houses or break embankments; it waits, season after season, until fields go quiet.A nation may grow economically while allowing cultivable land to slip into export ponds, but it becomes dependent. Food security is not achieved through ports, highways, or megaprojects; it is achieved when water reaches the fields and seed meets soil.

A recent Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) study has revealed that around TK 250 crore has been siphoned off through corruption in land acquisition and compensation in five solar projects, with irregularities spanning every stage from approval to completion. The study also highlights a significant gap between official cost estimates and actual spending.These projects were designed to deliver affordable clean power and are already in operation. Landowners interviewed for the study alleged that coercive measures were used to pressure them to sell land at dismally low prices, and in some cases, they did not receive their promised compensation at all. Another six projects examined by the TIB show that their combined cost was Tk 6,970 crore, far above the Tk 4,043 crore that would have been expected as per the Bangladesh Power Development Board's estimate of the average costs of setting up solar plants. In other words, about Tk 2,926 crore was overestimated compared to actual costs. Alarmingly, the study has found that the average electricity tariff of these projects is about $0.124 per kilowatt-hour, which is significantly higher than tariffs in our neighbouring countries.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.According to the TIB, a syndicate of plant officials, local land registration officials, union and upazila land office staff, middlemen, local public representatives, and even members of parliament were involved in the corruption. From the outset, vested interest groups exerted influence over policymaking and strategy formulation. The same networks reappeared during land acquisition and environmental clearance, leading to coordinated manipulation of compensation, leasing arrangements, and approval processes.Such story of corruption during Awami League's tenure is widely known, but its impact on the renewable energy sector should particularly alarm policymakers. Renewables now account for about five percent of total generation capacity, with solar contributing more than 80 percent of that share. Solar remains a largely untapped resource to this day.

A recent Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) study has revealed that around TK 250 crore has been siphoned off through corruption in land acquisition and compensation in five solar projects, with irregularities spanning every stage from approval to completion. The study also highlights a significant gap between official cost estimates and actual spending.These projects were designed to deliver affordable clean power and are already in operation. Landowners interviewed for the study alleged that coercive measures were used to pressure them to sell land at dismally low prices, and in some cases, they did not receive their promised compensation at all. Another six projects examined by the TIB show that their combined cost was Tk 6,970 crore, far above the Tk 4,043 crore that would have been expected as per the Bangladesh Power Development Board's estimate of the average costs of setting up solar plants. In other words, about Tk 2,926 crore was overestimated compared to actual costs. Alarmingly, the study has found that the average electricity tariff of these projects is about $0.124 per kilowatt-hour, which is significantly higher than tariffs in our neighbouring countries.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.According to the TIB, a syndicate of plant officials, local land registration officials, union and upazila land office staff, middlemen, local public representatives, and even members of parliament were involved in the corruption.

He died because someone decided that verification was optional, that due process of law can be ignored. He was beaten, dragged, hung, burned and filmed. Not in the dark. Not in secrecy.

What makes this death particularly unbearable is not only its brutality but its emptiness. Even the agencies tasked with enforcing law and order have admitted that there is no direct evidence that Dipu Chandra Das insulted religion at all, not that doing so justifies extrajudicial actions. No post. No recording. No witness who actually heard the alleged words. Everyone heard that someone heard something somewhere. That was enough.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Read moreDipu’s ashes on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway are gone. The stain on our souls remains.German American philosopher Hannah Arendt warned that when facts lose their authority, the space they leave behind is quickly occupied by violence. A mob does not require proof. It requires permission. Sometimes that permission comes from silence, sometimes from delay, and sometimes from the quiet decision to push a man outside a factory gate to save property while surrendering a life. Institutions may not strike the blow, but they often step aside to make room for it.The most terrifying line in the official narrative, therefore, is not about the fire or fists. It is the sentence that says he was handed over to protect the factory. It reveals a hierarchy more disturbing than any slogan shouted that night. Order was maintained. Production survived. A worker did not.This was not an eruption of uncontrollable madness. It unfolded over hours. Accusations circulated. Groups formed. Calls were made late. By the time law enforcement arrived, the ritual had concluded. And yet, even as Dipu's body burned, the next tragedy for the nation was already in the making. A young political leader and organiser, Sharif Osman Hadi, shot in broad daylight of December 12, was declared dead on that same day—December 18—by the doctors in Singapore. The aftermath? Vested groups exploiting it to attack the offices of Prothom Alo and The Daily Star at night and vandalise cultural institutions.What's worth noting is each such incident of mob violence often arrives with a press statement from the government promising justice, and departs with an investigation that soon fades into abstraction. The pattern is so consistent that it now feels almost administrative. Besides, there is a peculiar irony in how quickly the word \"conspiracy\" is deployed in public discourse. Everything is planned, we are told. Everything is destabilisation. Everything is someone else's design. But what if the most effective \"conspiracy\" requires no mastermind at all? What if it is sustained by predictable delays, familiar denials, and the collective comfort of never holding the system itself accountable? When people do not trust institutions to deliver the justice they want, they outsource judgment to the street, even if the verdict is flawed. When law becomes slow, spectacle becomes swift. The mob promises instant resolution, even if that resolution arrives soaked in blood.There is something grotesquely modern about this violence. It is not only physical but performative. Phones are raised as fists fall. The burning body becomes content. The horror is shared, commented on, argued over, monetised by attention. American writer Susan Sontag warned that repeated exposure to images of suffering risks turning pain into consumption. We are now consuming our own collapse.The state responds with numbers. Arrests counted. Law enforcement operations named. Weapon licenses facilitated. Police training programmes announced. The language is managerial, as if violence were a logistical glitch rather than a moral failure. We are told that thousands have been arrested. We are told that security is being strengthened. Yet, crime statistics rise, as does people's sense of fear and uncertainty.Perhaps the problem is not absence of force but absence of foresight. Preventive intelligence is discussed after each catastrophe like an afterthought we keep forgetting to remember. Former police officials now speak openly about preventive detention, a tool that sounds alarming in theory but strangely comforting in a society where prevention has become an endangered concept. But even prevention cannot succeed if it is applied selectively or theatrically. Law enforcement cannot appear only when cameras are present and vanish when crowds gather.A society is judged not by how loudly it condemns such violence but by how rarely it allows it to happen. Bangladesh today condemns well. It investigates verbosely. It mourns briefly. Then it moves on, leaving behind families who must learn to live with the knowledge that truth arrived too late to save a life.Read more6 more held over Dipu killingDipu Chandra Das had a daughter who will grow up knowing her father through news reports and viral videos. That is the inheritance we are offering the next generation. Not safety. Not surety of justice. We must reverse this course. We must understand that if the upcoming elections are a national priority, so is preserving the sanctity of life. If religion is sacred, so is restraint in a democratic society. And if the state claims authority, it must reclaim its credibility through sufficient presence, speed, and moral clarity.Otherwise, we should stop pretending that these are isolated failures. Rather we should accept the truth that a society that continuously allows outrage to replace evidence will keep producing graves long before it produces justice.H. M.

For BNP, that moment arrived on Thursday. For most of the past decade, the party has been steered from afar by its acting chairman, Tarique Rahman, while in exile in London. His return marks a long-awaited exhilaration—especially for grassroots supporters who, year after year, had held their breath—and a historic moment for the nation.Rahmanlanded in Dhakaaccompanied by his wife, Zubaida Rahman, their daughter, Zaima, and—to the delight of his social media followers—the family cat. The symbolism was heavy. Just outside the airport terminal, the 60-year-old leader paused to stand barefoot, a gesture of reverence for the soil from which he had been absent for 17 years, before boarding a bulletproof bus that carried him in a festive procession to a reception venue. There, he addressed a sea of supporters. It was a grounding moment in every sense, bringing to an end a period of suspended animation that began with his departure to the UK in 2008 and worsened under Sheikh Hasina's authoritarian rule.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.His return may help restore a measure of equilibrium to a fractured political landscape, but the road home was shaped by a new reality. Following Hasina's ouster last year, Rahman was relieved of politically motivated convictions in a litany of cases. Upon landing, he thanked Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus by phone from the airport lounge for the security provided to him and his family. When he finally addressed the crowd, the most resonant passage of his speech came when he promised to build a \"safe Bangladesh\"—the basic concept of security that has felt elusive recently. He painted a picture of a nation free from the violence that has stalked its streets. He envisioned a nation where \"every woman, man, and child can leave home and return safely.\"Read moreTarique Rahman and the question of political renewalRahman called for unity rather than vengeance. His tone was inclusive and forward-looking as he sketched a vision of the country's recovery. Playing on the famous words of Martin Luther King Jr., he declared, \"I have a plan. I have a plan for the people of my country.\" It was a deliberate rhetorical pivot—from grievance to governance. He also recalled the martyrdom of Sharif Osman Hadi in his struggle to restore democratic rights.Hisemphasis on pluralismwas also striking. \"Just as there are people of the hills in this country, similarly there are people of the plain lands,\" he said, explicitly embracing Bangladesh's religious and ethnic mosaic—Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians alike. \"We all want to build such a Bangladesh, the dream of which a mother sees,\" he added. The metaphor is politically astute. Rahman underscored the daunting demographics of the nation he hopes to lead: millions of young people and children, and a female population that makes up half the country.In a departure from the pomp of the past, Rahman sat on a simple, unadorned wooden chair at the reception venue. It was a calculated visual metaphor: a rejection of the \"throne\" mentality that has long plagued the country's leadership.The exile is over. Rahman's physical presence now serves as a counterweight to the swelling influence of rival political actors. The challenges ahead are immense, but as his bulletproof bus wound its way through cheering crowds in Dhaka, the prevailing mood was one of palpable relief. He is rightly credited with preserving party unity through the lean years of opposition. His second act—now waiting to play out on home soil ahead of a February election—will depend on whether he can charm a new generation and convince a nation emerging from trauma that he represents a fresh start, rather than a return to business as usual.Related topic:Tarique Rahman homecomingBNP acting chairman Tarique RahmanBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)Bangladesh politics 2025Tarique Rahman's returnTarique Rahman return to BangladeshClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsI hope you can take criticism as an expression of love: Khairul Basar14h agoUnity and consensus are key to achieving reforms12m agoTarique says return not entirely within his control as Khaleda critically ill3w agoBNP must control errant party activists1y agoBNP supporters gather outside Evercare ahead of Tarique Rahman’s visit1d ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

His tone was inclusive and forward-looking as he sketched a vision of the country's recovery. Playing on the famous words of Martin Luther King Jr., he declared, \"I have a plan. I have a plan for the people of my country.\" It was a deliberate rhetorical pivot—from grievance to governance. He also recalled the martyrdom of Sharif Osman Hadi in his struggle to restore democratic rights.Hisemphasis on pluralismwas also striking. \"Just as there are people of the hills in this country, similarly there are people of the plain lands,\" he said, explicitly embracing Bangladesh's religious and ethnic mosaic—Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians alike. \"We all want to build such a Bangladesh, the dream of which a mother sees,\" he added. The metaphor is politically astute. Rahman underscored the daunting demographics of the nation he hopes to lead: millions of young people and children, and a female population that makes up half the country.In a departure from the pomp of the past, Rahman sat on a simple, unadorned wooden chair at the reception venue. It was a calculated visual metaphor: a rejection of the \"throne\" mentality that has long plagued the country's leadership.The exile is over. Rahman's physical presence now serves as a counterweight to the swelling influence of rival political actors. The challenges ahead are immense, but as his bulletproof bus wound its way through cheering crowds in Dhaka, the prevailing mood was one of palpable relief. He is rightly credited with preserving party unity through the lean years of opposition. His second act—now waiting to play out on home soil ahead of a February election—will depend on whether he can charm a new generation and convince a nation emerging from trauma that he represents a fresh start, rather than a return to business as usual.Related topic:Tarique Rahman homecomingBNP acting chairman Tarique RahmanBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)Bangladesh politics 2025Tarique Rahman's returnTarique Rahman return to BangladeshClick to commentCommentsComments Policy Thu Dec 25, 2025 09:08 PMLast update on: Thu Dec 25, 2025 10:17 PM Thu Dec 25, 2025 09:08 PM      Last update on: Thu Dec 25, 2025 10:17 PM Related topic:Tarique Rahman homecomingBNP acting chairman Tarique RahmanBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)Bangladesh politics 2025Tarique Rahman's returnTarique Rahman return to Bangladesh Related topic:Tarique Rahman homecomingBNP acting chairman Tarique RahmanBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)Bangladesh politics 2025Tarique Rahman's returnTarique Rahman return to Bangladesh Click to comment   Related NewsI hope you can take criticism as an expression of love: Khairul Basar14h agoUnity and consensus are key to achieving reforms12m agoTarique says return not entirely within his control as Khaleda critically ill3w agoBNP must control errant party activists1y agoBNP supporters gather outside Evercare ahead of Tarique Rahman’s visit1d ago I hope you can take criticism as an expression of love: Khairul Basar14h ago Unity and consensus are key to achieving reforms12m ago Tarique says return not entirely within his control as Khaleda critically ill3w ago BNP must control errant party activists1y ago BNP supporters gather outside Evercare ahead of Tarique Rahman’s visit1d ago |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে |বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে |রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে     About UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives  ",

The interim government took bold steps to confront the financial sector crisis, pushing through a bank merger, non-bank liquidations, new laws and tighter supervision.Yet by the end of the year, the financial sector readings tell a sobering story.Bad loans are at a record high, depositor confidence is shaken, and reforms are still constrained by old power structures.These constraints became painfully clear as the year progressed, culminating in alarming data by the third quarter.Read moreA decade needed to get rid of bad loan crisisAs of September, non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector surged to Tk 6.44 lakh crore, nearly 36 percent of total outstanding credit. This was more than double the ratio a year earlier, and the highest level since 2000.Besides, more than a dozen commercial lenders reported default ratios above 50 percent, showing that distress was no longer confined to a handful of weak institutions.Large corporate groups accounted for a massive share of new defaults, especially after the fall of the Awami League government in August 2024.The rise in bad loans came amid a broader macroeconomic squeeze.Inflation remained high at around 8 percent, well above the central bank's target, while private sector credit growth slowed to record lows as lenders pulled back.Throughout the year, new investment remained stalled, as borrowing costs climbed with the central bank holding the policy rate at 10 percent -- the highest among neighbouring economies.Lending rates reached 16 percent to 17 percent, further dampening business activity. Confidence, already fragile, eroded further as depositors started to question the safety of their savings.Faced with mounting stress, the interim government opted for emergency repair rather than incremental change.The most discussed move was the merger of five troubled shariah-based lenders into the state-run Sammilito Islami Bank PLC.Licensed on 30 October, the new bank became the largest Islamic lender in the country overnight, with paid-up capital of Tk 35,000 crore, including Tk 20,000 crore from the government.The merger dominated public attention throughout the second half of the year. Depositors rushed to branches, overwhelming staff and triggering chaos in several locations. Although the Bangladesh Bank provided liquidity support multiple times, withdrawals continued, while many customers were unable to access their funds.Four of the banks -- First Security Islami Bank, Social Islami Bank, Union Bank and Global Islami Bank -- had been dominated by the controversial S Alam Group, while EXIM Bank was controlled by Nazrul Islam Mazumder of Nassa Group.This ownership concentration highlighted how political patronage had shaped the crisis.Authorities assured depositors that their money would eventually be recovered, but the central bank governor made clear that general shareholders would receive nothing, declaring their scrips worthless.Alongside the merger, the banking regulator moved to shut down nine troubled non-bank financial institutions. Together, these actions marked a break from the long-standing practice of keeping weak institutions alive through regulatory indulgence.To support the reform initiatives, the government also strengthened the legal framework for crisis management.Read moreHow to rescue banks without creating more riskThe Bank Resolution Ordinance 2025 gave authorities the power to intervene in failing banks, protect depositors and impose losses on shareholders. The central bank set up a dedicated Bank Resolution Department to implement the law.In November, the Deposit Protection Ordinance 2025 doubled the insured deposit ceiling from Tk 1 lakh to Tk 2 lakh, covering about 93 percent of depositors nationwide.Governance reform, however, proved more contentious.Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur initiated steps to amend the Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 to strengthen central bank autonomy and align it with global standards.The draft proposal included removing bureaucrats from the board and reducing political influence. Resistance from within the bureaucracy and the finance ministry quickly followed, slowing progress.Economists argued that genuine independence of the central bank would require abolishing the Banking and Financial Institutions Division under the finance ministry, but officials opposed the idea.By year-end, the push for BB's autonomy had slowed, leaving the future of reform uncertain without strong political backing.Meanwhile, other regulatory measures advanced more quietly.The central bank updated loan classification rules, conducted asset quality reviews to assess the actual health of bank balance sheets and prepared to shift toward risk-based supervision.Moving away from checklist inspections toward continuous risk monitoring, a key condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its ongoing loan programme, is scheduled for full implementation in January 2026.Draft amendments to the Bank Company Act, which are intended to tighten eligibility for bank owners and directors, were prepared but left for the next elected government as the country entered the election cycle.While banking reforms dominated headlines, the external sector offered some relief.A crackdown on illegal money transfer channels like hundi and hawla helped stabilise the foreign exchange market, while lower import costs eased pressure on reserves.Expatriate Bangladeshis sent a record $30.04 billion in remittances in the fiscal year 2024-25, the highest ever in a single fiscal year.Gross foreign exchange reserves rose to $32.57 billion by mid-December, up from $24.94 billion a year earlier, reversing the sharp decline seen under the previous regime.In 2025, new technologies also began to appear in the banking conversation, though more as a promise than a right-now solution.Some banks rolled out early AI-powered services, and the Bangladesh Bank reopened applications for digital bank licences, attracting interest from telecom operators, financial institutions and conglomerates.These initiatives signalled a longer-term shift but did little to address the immediate crisis of governance and asset quality.Now, as the country ends 2025 and prepares to enter another new year, one conclusion stood out. The outgoing year did not fix the banking sector, but it stripped away illusions.The true scale of bad loans was revealed, political protection weakened, and the first tools for orderly resolution were put in place. Whether these patchwork repairs evolve into lasting reform will depend on political will after the election and the willingness to confront entrenched interests.

Feature phones dominated production with a 61.21 percent share, while 4G handsets accounted for 34.29 percent.The rise in local 5G handset production followed the limited commercial rollout of 5G services by Robi Axiata and Grameenphone from September 1, 2025.Grameenphone introduced 5G across all eight divisional headquarters, though coverage remains limited to selected areas. Robi launched 5G services in parts of Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet.\"5G penetration has started in the country as customers are increasingly looking for 5G handsets. That's why we have stepped up and started manufacturing,\" said Rezwanul Hoque, CEO of ISMARTU Technology BD Limited, the local maker of Tecno handsets.He added that Tecno has already launched four 5G smartphone models locally.Hoque also said that the global supply chain is now dominated by 5G devices, prompting many local manufacturers to shift their production. \"After the launch of 5G, customers prefer the handset to come with 5G-support if the price goes beyond Tk 30,000,\" he added.According to BTRC, around 62 percent of devices currently in use nationwide are smartphones, most of which are 4G-enabled. Industry estimates suggest only 6.6 percent of devices can connect to 5G networks.Imported and expatriate-gifted handsets make up roughly 50 to 60 percent of the smartphone market. Many of these are high-end 5G-ready devices, though a significant portion is refurbished models, industry insiders said.Robi Axiata said 5G adoption will be gradual. \"In 200 areas, 5G penetration among devices is already 12-15 percent, with 120 areas reaching nearly 20 percent penetration. Our initial focus will be rolling out 5G to these areas,\" said Shahed Alam, chief corporate and regulatory affairs officer of Robi Axiata.He added that most imported and gifted handsets registered on Robi's network are compatible with 5G.According to Robi estimates, it may take five to seven years for 5G adoption to reach current 4G levels, as affordability and economic factors remain key challenges.Click to commentCommentsComments Policy|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

That's why we have stepped up and started manufacturing,\" said Rezwanul Hoque, CEO of ISMARTU Technology BD Limited, the local maker of Tecno handsets.He added that Tecno has already launched four 5G smartphone models locally.Hoque also said that the global supply chain is now dominated by 5G devices, prompting many local manufacturers to shift their production. \"After the launch of 5G, customers prefer the handset to come with 5G-support if the price goes beyond Tk 30,000,\" he added.According to BTRC, around 62 percent of devices currently in use nationwide are smartphones, most of which are 4G-enabled. Industry estimates suggest only 6.6 percent of devices can connect to 5G networks.Imported and expatriate-gifted handsets make up roughly 50 to 60 percent of the smartphone market. Many of these are high-end 5G-ready devices, though a significant portion is refurbished models, industry insiders said.Robi Axiata said 5G adoption will be gradual. \"In 200 areas, 5G penetration among devices is already 12-15 percent, with 120 areas reaching nearly 20 percent penetration. Our initial focus will be rolling out 5G to these areas,\" said Shahed Alam, chief corporate and regulatory affairs officer of Robi Axiata.He added that most imported and gifted handsets registered on Robi's network are compatible with 5G.According to Robi estimates, it may take five to seven years for 5G adoption to reach current 4G levels, as affordability and economic factors remain key challenges.Click to commentCommentsComments Policy|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে BusinessMahmudul HasanFri Dec 26, 2025 12:00 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:08 AMMost Viewed'This country belongs to people of the hills and plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians'Tarique Rahman returns home after 17 years in exileA psychological reset for BNP, a moment of political recalibration for BangladeshZubaida, daughter Zaima reach Gulshan residence BusinessMahmudul HasanFri Dec 26, 2025 12:00 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:08 AM Mahmudul HasanFri Dec 26, 2025 12:00 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:08 AM Most Viewed'This country belongs to people of the hills and plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians'Tarique Rahman returns home after 17 years in exileA psychological reset for BNP, a moment of political recalibration for BangladeshZubaida, daughter Zaima reach Gulshan residence 'This country belongs to people of the hills and plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians' Tarique Rahman returns home after 17 years in exile A psychological reset for BNP, a moment of political recalibration for Bangladesh Zubaida, daughter Zaima reach Gulshan residence   BusinessBusiness5G handset production hits 1 lakh again  amid rolloutFri Dec 26, 2025 12:00 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:08 AMMahmudul HasanFri Dec 26, 2025 12:00 AM      Last update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 09:08 AMLocal manufacturing of 5G handsets crossed the one lakh mark in October for the second time since June 2024, as manufacturers grew optimistic following the commercial launch of 5G services by mobile operators.In October, local assemblers produced 1.08 lakh 5G handsets, up from 63,000 units in September, according to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC).For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Earlier, in June 2024, production had also exceeded one lakh units, reaching 1.55 lakh.Despite the increase, 5G devices accounted for only 4.74 percent of the total 22.81 lakh handsets manufactured in Bangladesh in October.

By the time Beijing resumed buying in October under a new trade agreement, Bangladeshi importers had already seized the opportunity.Bangladesh's private sector has also stepped up imports of US cotton, wheat and liquefied natural gas under commitments to reduce the bilateral trade gap.Following intense negotiations, the Trump administration in August cut reciprocal tariffs on Bangladeshi goods to 20 percent from 37 percent imposed in April 2025.The US-Bangladesh trade relationship has grown considerably over recent decades, although the balance remains heavily in Dhaka's favour. In 2024, US exports to Bangladesh totalled $2.3 billion, while imports from Bangladesh reached $8.4 billion.Jim Sutter, chief executive of USSEC, said in November that US soybeans and soybean meal are the largest American agricultural exports to Bangladesh.He added that Bangladesh's leading soy-processing firms and meal importers recently signed a Letter of Intent worth $1.25 billion to purchase US soybeans and soybean meal over the coming year.Sutter described the agreement as \"a landmark\" that highlights sustainability and supply chain resilience.\"Participants are collaborating with USSEC to advance sourcing standards, technical engagement, and growth of the protein-feed ecosystem in Bangladesh,\" he said.Bangladesh produces only about 7 percent of its annual soybean demand, relying on imports for the remainder.Sutter said the country now has a large and modern crushing industry that supplies most of its soybean meal and oil needs. Bangladesh maintains a zero percent import tariff on soybeans and soybean meal, providing a stable trade environment.In the 2023-24 marketing year, the US accounted for 32 percent of Bangladesh's soybean imports and 3 percent of its soybean meal imports. Industry leaders expect these shares to rise sharply under recent agreements.Md Taslim Shahriar, deputy general manager of Meghna Group of Industries, said Bangladesh has reduced soybean imports from Brazil over the past six to seven months in favour of US supplies.Read moreBangladesh cashes in on US soybean glut as China turns awayHe said American soybeans are currently priced at $485-$490 per tonne, about $10 cheaper than Brazilian beans, although transport costs are $15 higher.Amirul Haque, managing director of Delta Agrofood, one of the country's largest crushers, said competitive pricing is the main driver of the shift.He added that the private sector is committed to reducing the trade gap with the US.\"We want policy support from the government so we can contribute more to the nation,\" Haque said. \"We are trying to reduce the trade gap further so that our trade with America keeps growing.\"Related topic:Bangladesh US soybean importsClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated News5 ways soybean imports benefit Bangladesh amid US-China trade war2m agoBangladesh cashes in on US soybean glut as China turns away2m ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

It is estimated that ambient air pollution causes 90 thousand deaths every year in Bangladesh. Imagine if an industrial accident had caused as many deaths — and that too every year. Countless more people suffer from chronic illness, lost productivity, and reduced well-being. This makes air pollution an enormous burden on the economy as well.But this crisis is not hopeless. Drawing on recent research, including my own, and the insights I gained from working with policy-makers in Bangladesh, this article unpacks the air pollution challenge, clarifies common misconceptions, and proposes concrete steps that can address the problem. While many of these steps are at the level of policy and government action, I will also provide some practical measures that you, as an individual, could take to protect yourself and your family.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.THE PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION IN BANGLADESHAir pollution in Bangladesh is among the most severe in the world. The largest health harm is caused by very small particles — those with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (scientifically known as PM2.5). These particles are so small that they cannot be seen, and they can bypass our bodies' natural filters and enter our bloodstream when we inhale them.The World Health Organization's (WHO) guideline is that there should not be more than 5 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air (5 µg/m³), but in Bangladesh, the national average in 2023 was 62 µg/m³ — 12 times higher than the WHO guideline. According to the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), Bangladeshis lose, on average, 5.5 years of life expectancy compared to a scenario in which the WHO guideline is met. In districts such as Dhaka and Gazipur, more than seven years of life expectancy is lost.Air pollution affects our health by increasing the risk of many conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, respiratory infections, asthma, and lung cancer. Although it is never possible to know with certainty whether a health condition in a specific individual is caused by air pollution, research has shown that air pollution increases the share of the population that suffers from and dies of these conditions.In addition to the health costs, there is increasing evidence that air pollution substantially reduces productivity in both physically and cognitively demanding jobs. This means that high levels of air pollution make us less productive and ultimately economically poorer.Annual air pollution averages estimated from satellite data, compared with national and WHO air quality standards. Data: van Donkelaar et al. (2021).WHERE DOES THE POLLUTION COME FROM?Scientists broadly agree on the main sources:• Power generation (especially coal- and oil-fired power plants and diesel generators)• Open waste burning• Traffic (especially old buses and trucks)• Brick kilns• Other industries (e.g. steel mills and fertiliser plants)• Households burning solid fuel (e.g. firewood) for cooking• Dust from roads and construction• Natural causes such as sea salt and soil dust• Pollution entering Bangladesh from other countriesThere is still debate among scientists about how large each of these contributing sources is. What we do know is that there is no single main source that, if reduced, would allow us to solve most of the problem. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach that addresses multiple sources simultaneously will be necessary.Bangladesh is the country losing the most life expectancy to air pollution worldwide. Data: AQLI.COMMON MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT AIR POLLUTIONDespite the urgency of the situation, many misconceptions cloud public and policy understanding of air pollution in Bangladesh.1. Air pollution is primarily an outdoor problemOne widespread belief is that the worst air is outdoors, and that by staying inside, individuals can avoid its harms. But my co-authored research in Mirpur tells a different story. We found that indoor pollution levels are similar to those outside.2. Air pollution is mostly an urban problemAnother common misconception is that air pollution is mainly an issue for cities like Dhaka, while rural areas are safe. It is true that urban areas generally have higher pollution levels, but rural Bangladesh also experiences very high levels of air pollution. In other words, reducing air pollution is a priority for all of Bangladesh, not just urban areas.3. Trees are a simple solutionMany people believe that planting trees and keeping plants at home can meaningfully reduce particulate pollution. While green spaces offer many benefits, including some reduction in air pollution, these effects are small relative to the scale of Bangladesh's air pollution problem.SIX POLICY PROPOSALS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTIONIf we are to make meaningful progress, we must deploy resources where they can deliver the greatest gains in reduced air pollution at a reasonable cost. Below are my top six policy proposals that are both feasible and capable of generating large public health gains.1. Raise taxes and duties on highly polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and oil. We should tax the source of the pollution — the fuel itself — and then allow producers and consumers to determine the best alternatives, rather than having the government attempt to micro-manage the transition. In addition, these duties will raise government revenue.2. Phase out coal-fired brick kilns. Almost all brick kilns in Bangladesh operate in violation of existing regulations, yet 25% of the kilns account for 50% of the health harms. The Department of Environment should prioritise enforcing regulations on the most harmful brick kilns first. These are typically kilns located upwind of large cities or those using outdated technologies. The recent announcement, and subsequent enforcement, of a brick kiln ban in Savar is a step in the right direction; many more such decisions need to be taken. As bricks become scarcer, more construction will shift to alternative materials, such as concrete blocks.3. Promote a shift among rural households away from burning solid fuel for cooking, and towards stoves that generate less air pollution, such as LPG gas stoves. This would reduce both ambient air pollution and indoor pollution caused by traditional cook stoves. Indoor pollution from cook stoves is a major health crisis, affecting women in rural areas in particular. Subsidising LPG cylinders for rural households is an effective way to promote this transition.4. Reduce reliance on coal and oil for electricity generation. Bangladesh needs electricity to prosper, but the government should not allow any more coal- or oil-fired power plants to be built and should phase out older plants, such as Barapukuria, which lack modern equipment to clean emissions before they are released into the atmosphere. Instead, Bangladesh should make use of its substantial solar energy potential by continuing to accelerate the installation of solar panels. Furthermore, Bangladesh could import more electricity, especially from Himalayan hydropower, which is a natural complement to solar power. The existing agreement to purchase electricity from Nepal should be expanded to larger volumes, and hydropower from other sources, such as Bhutan, should also be included.5. Stricter enforcement of the ban on open waste burning. Businesses and individuals who engage in open waste or crop residue burning should face stringent fines. This practice is already banned, so implementation should be prioritised by detecting burning and holding responsible actors accountable, especially in and around densely populated urban areas. Municipal corporations also need to improve waste collection and management systems.6. Phase out old, polluting vehicles, especially buses and heavy trucks. We can begin by replacing buses used for public transportation — something the government is already in the process of doing for Dhaka, but has not yet fully implemented. This needs to be implemented not only in Dhaka, but across all public transportation systems nationwide. Old trucks should also be phased out or retrofitted with catalytic converters and filters.As can be seen from the policy proposals above, enforcement and action are the key steps, rather than introducing new laws, targets, and regulations. However, the government has limited capacity to enforce all rules simultaneously and everywhere. Therefore, I emphasise that enforcement efforts should prioritise the most harmful emission sources first — typically those located within, or just upwind of, densely populated urban areas.WHAT CAN I DO?The most common action taken to reduce exposure to air pollution is to wear a mask when outside. This can help if you are wearing an N95, KN95, or FFP2 mask; however, cloth masks or simple surgical masks do not provide substantial protection. A much more underutilised technology is air purifiers.1. Install air purifiers in your bedroom(s)One of the most effective ways of protecting oneself and one's family is to install an air purifier in your home. Specifically, if you place an air purifier in your bedroom, close all doors and windows, and run it throughout the night while you sleep — at least during the winter months, when air pollution is at its peak. Research carried out by me and my co-authors shows that even a small air purifier reduces air pollution in a room by 80% when run on medium speed, provided doors and windows are closed. There are many good models available; the most important thing is that the purifier has a HEPA filter.2. Install air purifiers in all schools, hospitals, and indoor workplacesThe government should mandate schools to run air purifiers in classrooms with windows shut during the winter season. This will protect children, at least while they are in the classroom. The same can be done in hospitals and indoor workplaces. In addition to the health benefits, there is suggestive evidence that better air quality improves learning among children and substantial evidence that it makes workers more productive.HOW DO OUR INSTITUTIONS NEED TO CHANGE?1. The government should focus on taking domestic action immediately, not making goals for the future or international agreementsWhile transboundary pollution (i.e. pollution that drifts into Bangladesh from neighbouring countries) is real, Bangladesh should prioritise its own domestic pollution first. Most pollution originates within the country, and this is the only pollution that the government can realistically control. International agreements or pledges to meet future goals are, at best, a distraction from the important tasks at hand and, at worst, a way for policy-makers to gain credit for signing agreements rather than taking real actions that reduce pollution. We can still be inspired by other countries' successes and emulate their solutions; no international treaties or high-level political cooperation are necessary for that to happen. If each country in South Asia focuses on tackling its own emissions, cross-border pollution will also decline.2. Media and civil society organisations should educate the population and promote long-term solutionsFirst and foremost, media and civil society organisations need to communicate the extent to which the air pollution crisis is harming us all. For instance, the media tends to focus on air pollution only when it peaks during the winter months. Unfortunately, it is not helpful to demand that the government \"take action now\" only once Dhaka becomes the most polluted city in the world. The truth is that there is often little the government can do on that particular day itself. The media and civil society should also ask the government what it is doing to prepare for the coming winter and the years ahead.Expectations should also be realistic; even in China — the country that has reduced air pollution levels most rapidly — it took five years for pollution to decline by 40%. Therefore, credit should be given for steps taken in the right direction, even if the situation remains poor; otherwise, there is little incentive for politicians to address the problem.BANGLADESH IS READY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMMany countries, such as the UK, the US, and China, have substantially reduced air pollution, but this did not happen by itself. It required multiple parts of society — government, industry, media, and an engaged public — to make this a priority. I firmly believe that Bangladeshi society will rise to the occasion and that we will substantially improve our air quality.Martin Mattssonis an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the National University of Singapore.Click to commentCommentsComments Policy|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

It is estimated that ambient air pollution causes 90 thousand deaths every year in Bangladesh. Imagine if an industrial accident had caused as many deaths — and that too every year. Countless more people suffer from chronic illness, lost productivity, and reduced well-being. This makes air pollution an enormous burden on the economy as well.But this crisis is not hopeless. Drawing on recent research, including my own, and the insights I gained from working with policy-makers in Bangladesh, this article unpacks the air pollution challenge, clarifies common misconceptions, and proposes concrete steps that can address the problem. While many of these steps are at the level of policy and government action, I will also provide some practical measures that you, as an individual, could take to protect yourself and your family.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.THE PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION IN BANGLADESHAir pollution in Bangladesh is among the most severe in the world. The largest health harm is caused by very small particles — those with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (scientifically known as PM2.5). These particles are so small that they cannot be seen, and they can bypass our bodies' natural filters and enter our bloodstream when we inhale them.The World Health Organization's (WHO) guideline is that there should not be more than 5 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air (5 µg/m³), but in Bangladesh, the national average in 2023 was 62 µg/m³ — 12 times higher than the WHO guideline. According to the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), Bangladeshis lose, on average, 5.5 years of life expectancy compared to a scenario in which the WHO guideline is met. In districts such as Dhaka and Gazipur, more than seven years of life expectancy is lost.Air pollution affects our health by increasing the risk of many conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, respiratory infections, asthma, and lung cancer. Although it is never possible to know with certainty whether a health condition in a specific individual is caused by air pollution, research has shown that air pollution increases the share of the population that suffers from and dies of these conditions.In addition to the health costs, there is increasing evidence that air pollution substantially reduces productivity in both physically and cognitively demanding jobs. This means that high levels of air pollution make us less productive and ultimately economically poorer.Annual air pollution averages estimated from satellite data, compared with national and WHO air quality standards. Data: van Donkelaar et al. (2021).WHERE DOES THE POLLUTION COME FROM?Scientists broadly agree on the main sources:• Power generation (especially coal- and oil-fired power plants and diesel generators)• Open waste burning• Traffic (especially old buses and trucks)• Brick kilns• Other industries (e.g. steel mills and fertiliser plants)• Households burning solid fuel (e.g. firewood) for cooking• Dust from roads and construction• Natural causes such as sea salt and soil dust• Pollution entering Bangladesh from other countriesThere is still debate among scientists about how large each of these contributing sources is. What we do know is that there is no single main source that, if reduced, would allow us to solve most of the problem. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach that addresses multiple sources simultaneously will be necessary.Bangladesh is the country losing the most life expectancy to air pollution worldwide. Data: AQLI.COMMON MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT AIR POLLUTIONDespite the urgency of the situation, many misconceptions cloud public and policy understanding of air pollution in Bangladesh.1. Air pollution is primarily an outdoor problemOne widespread belief is that the worst air is outdoors, and that by staying inside, individuals can avoid its harms. But my co-authored research in Mirpur tells a different story. We found that indoor pollution levels are similar to those outside.2. Air pollution is mostly an urban problemAnother common misconception is that air pollution is mainly an issue for cities like Dhaka, while rural areas are safe. It is true that urban areas generally have higher pollution levels, but rural Bangladesh also experiences very high levels of air pollution. In other words, reducing air pollution is a priority for all of Bangladesh, not just urban areas.3. Trees are a simple solutionMany people believe that planting trees and keeping plants at home can meaningfully reduce particulate pollution. While green spaces offer many benefits, including some reduction in air pollution, these effects are small relative to the scale of Bangladesh's air pollution problem.SIX POLICY PROPOSALS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTIONIf we are to make meaningful progress, we must deploy resources where they can deliver the greatest gains in reduced air pollution at a reasonable cost. Below are my top six policy proposals that are both feasible and capable of generating large public health gains.1. Raise taxes and duties on highly polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and oil. We should tax the source of the pollution — the fuel itself — and then allow producers and consumers to determine the best alternatives, rather than having the government attempt to micro-manage the transition. In addition, these duties will raise government revenue.2. Phase out coal-fired brick kilns. Almost all brick kilns in Bangladesh operate in violation of existing regulations, yet 25% of the kilns account for 50% of the health harms. The Department of Environment should prioritise enforcing regulations on the most harmful brick kilns first. These are typically kilns located upwind of large cities or those using outdated technologies. The recent announcement, and subsequent enforcement, of a brick kiln ban in Savar is a step in the right direction; many more such decisions need to be taken. As bricks become scarcer, more construction will shift to alternative materials, such as concrete blocks.3. Promote a shift among rural households away from burning solid fuel for cooking, and towards stoves that generate less air pollution, such as LPG gas stoves. This would reduce both ambient air pollution and indoor pollution caused by traditional cook stoves. Indoor pollution from cook stoves is a major health crisis, affecting women in rural areas in particular. Subsidising LPG cylinders for rural households is an effective way to promote this transition.4. Reduce reliance on coal and oil for electricity generation. Bangladesh needs electricity to prosper, but the government should not allow any more coal- or oil-fired power plants to be built and should phase out older plants, such as Barapukuria, which lack modern equipment to clean emissions before they are released into the atmosphere. Instead, Bangladesh should make use of its substantial solar energy potential by continuing to accelerate the installation of solar panels. Furthermore, Bangladesh could import more electricity, especially from Himalayan hydropower, which is a natural complement to solar power. The existing agreement to purchase electricity from Nepal should be expanded to larger volumes, and hydropower from other sources, such as Bhutan, should also be included.5. Stricter enforcement of the ban on open waste burning. Businesses and individuals who engage in open waste or crop residue burning should face stringent fines. This practice is already banned, so implementation should be prioritised by detecting burning and holding responsible actors accountable, especially in and around densely populated urban areas. Municipal corporations also need to improve waste collection and management systems.6. Phase out old, polluting vehicles, especially buses and heavy trucks. We can begin by replacing buses used for public transportation — something the government is already in the process of doing for Dhaka, but has not yet fully implemented. This needs to be implemented not only in Dhaka, but across all public transportation systems nationwide. Old trucks should also be phased out or retrofitted with catalytic converters and filters.As can be seen from the policy proposals above, enforcement and action are the key steps, rather than introducing new laws, targets, and regulations. However, the government has limited capacity to enforce all rules simultaneously and everywhere. Therefore, I emphasise that enforcement efforts should prioritise the most harmful emission sources first — typically those located within, or just upwind of, densely populated urban areas.WHAT CAN I DO?The most common action taken to reduce exposure to air pollution is to wear a mask when outside. This can help if you are wearing an N95, KN95, or FFP2 mask; however, cloth masks or simple surgical masks do not provide substantial protection. A much more underutilised technology is air purifiers.1. Install air purifiers in your bedroom(s)One of the most effective ways of protecting oneself and one's family is to install an air purifier in your home. Specifically, if you place an air purifier in your bedroom, close all doors and windows, and run it throughout the night while you sleep — at least during the winter months, when air pollution is at its peak. Research carried out by me and my co-authors shows that even a small air purifier reduces air pollution in a room by 80% when run on medium speed, provided doors and windows are closed. There are many good models available; the most important thing is that the purifier has a HEPA filter.2. Install air purifiers in all schools, hospitals, and indoor workplacesThe government should mandate schools to run air purifiers in classrooms with windows shut during the winter season. This will protect children, at least while they are in the classroom. The same can be done in hospitals and indoor workplaces. In addition to the health benefits, there is suggestive evidence that better air quality improves learning among children and substantial evidence that it makes workers more productive.HOW DO OUR INSTITUTIONS NEED TO CHANGE?1. The government should focus on taking domestic action immediately, not making goals for the future or international agreementsWhile transboundary pollution (i.e. pollution that drifts into Bangladesh from neighbouring countries) is real, Bangladesh should prioritise its own domestic pollution first. Most pollution originates within the country, and this is the only pollution that the government can realistically control. International agreements or pledges to meet future goals are, at best, a distraction from the important tasks at hand and, at worst, a way for policy-makers to gain credit for signing agreements rather than taking real actions that reduce pollution. We can still be inspired by other countries' successes and emulate their solutions; no international treaties or high-level political cooperation are necessary for that to happen. If each country in South Asia focuses on tackling its own emissions, cross-border pollution will also decline.2. Media and civil society organisations should educate the population and promote long-term solutionsFirst and foremost, media and civil society organisations need to communicate the extent to which the air pollution crisis is harming us all.

Almost all brick kilns in Bangladesh operate in violation of existing regulations, yet 25% of the kilns account for 50% of the health harms. The Department of Environment should prioritise enforcing regulations on the most harmful brick kilns first. These are typically kilns located upwind of large cities or those using outdated technologies. The recent announcement, and subsequent enforcement, of a brick kiln ban in Savar is a step in the right direction; many more such decisions need to be taken. As bricks become scarcer, more construction will shift to alternative materials, such as concrete blocks.3. Promote a shift among rural households away from burning solid fuel for cooking, and towards stoves that generate less air pollution, such as LPG gas stoves. This would reduce both ambient air pollution and indoor pollution caused by traditional cook stoves. Indoor pollution from cook stoves is a major health crisis, affecting women in rural areas in particular. Subsidising LPG cylinders for rural households is an effective way to promote this transition.4. Reduce reliance on coal and oil for electricity generation. Bangladesh needs electricity to prosper, but the government should not allow any more coal- or oil-fired power plants to be built and should phase out older plants, such as Barapukuria, which lack modern equipment to clean emissions before they are released into the atmosphere. Instead, Bangladesh should make use of its substantial solar energy potential by continuing to accelerate the installation of solar panels. Furthermore, Bangladesh could import more electricity, especially from Himalayan hydropower, which is a natural complement to solar power. The existing agreement to purchase electricity from Nepal should be expanded to larger volumes, and hydropower from other sources, such as Bhutan, should also be included.5. Stricter enforcement of the ban on open waste burning. Businesses and individuals who engage in open waste or crop residue burning should face stringent fines. This practice is already banned, so implementation should be prioritised by detecting burning and holding responsible actors accountable, especially in and around densely populated urban areas. Municipal corporations also need to improve waste collection and management systems.6. Phase out old, polluting vehicles, especially buses and heavy trucks. We can begin by replacing buses used for public transportation — something the government is already in the process of doing for Dhaka, but has not yet fully implemented. This needs to be implemented not only in Dhaka, but across all public transportation systems nationwide. Old trucks should also be phased out or retrofitted with catalytic converters and filters.As can be seen from the policy proposals above, enforcement and action are the key steps, rather than introducing new laws, targets, and regulations. However, the government has limited capacity to enforce all rules simultaneously and everywhere. Therefore, I emphasise that enforcement efforts should prioritise the most harmful emission sources first — typically those located within, or just upwind of, densely populated urban areas.WHAT CAN I DO?The most common action taken to reduce exposure to air pollution is to wear a mask when outside. This can help if you are wearing an N95, KN95, or FFP2 mask; however, cloth masks or simple surgical masks do not provide substantial protection. A much more underutilised technology is air purifiers.1. Install air purifiers in your bedroom(s)One of the most effective ways of protecting oneself and one's family is to install an air purifier in your home. Specifically, if you place an air purifier in your bedroom, close all doors and windows, and run it throughout the night while you sleep — at least during the winter months, when air pollution is at its peak. Research carried out by me and my co-authors shows that even a small air purifier reduces air pollution in a room by 80% when run on medium speed, provided doors and windows are closed. There are many good models available; the most important thing is that the purifier has a HEPA filter.2. Install air purifiers in all schools, hospitals, and indoor workplacesThe government should mandate schools to run air purifiers in classrooms with windows shut during the winter season. This will protect children, at least while they are in the classroom. The same can be done in hospitals and indoor workplaces. In addition to the health benefits, there is suggestive evidence that better air quality improves learning among children and substantial evidence that it makes workers more productive.HOW DO OUR INSTITUTIONS NEED TO CHANGE?1. The government should focus on taking domestic action immediately, not making goals for the future or international agreementsWhile transboundary pollution (i.e. pollution that drifts into Bangladesh from neighbouring countries) is real, Bangladesh should prioritise its own domestic pollution first. Most pollution originates within the country, and this is the only pollution that the government can realistically control. International agreements or pledges to meet future goals are, at best, a distraction from the important tasks at hand and, at worst, a way for policy-makers to gain credit for signing agreements rather than taking real actions that reduce pollution. We can still be inspired by other countries' successes and emulate their solutions; no international treaties or high-level political cooperation are necessary for that to happen. If each country in South Asia focuses on tackling its own emissions, cross-border pollution will also decline.2. Media and civil society organisations should educate the population and promote long-term solutionsFirst and foremost, media and civil society organisations need to communicate the extent to which the air pollution crisis is harming us all. For instance, the media tends to focus on air pollution only when it peaks during the winter months. Unfortunately, it is not helpful to demand that the government \"take action now\" only once Dhaka becomes the most polluted city in the world. The truth is that there is often little the government can do on that particular day itself. The media and civil society should also ask the government what it is doing to prepare for the coming winter and the years ahead.Expectations should also be realistic; even in China — the country that has reduced air pollution levels most rapidly — it took five years for pollution to decline by 40%. Therefore, credit should be given for steps taken in the right direction, even if the situation remains poor; otherwise, there is little incentive for politicians to address the problem.BANGLADESH IS READY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMMany countries, such as the UK, the US, and China, have substantially reduced air pollution, but this did not happen by itself. It required multiple parts of society — government, industry, media, and an engaged public — to make this a priority. I firmly believe that Bangladeshi society will rise to the occasion and that we will substantially improve our air quality.Martin Mattssonis an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at the National University of Singapore.Click to commentCommentsComments Policy  Big PictureBig PictureBreathing death: What Bangladesh must do to tackle air pollutionSat Dec 27, 2025 12:00 AMLast update on: Sat Dec 27, 2025 12:26 AMMartin MattssonSat Dec 27, 2025 12:00 AM      Last update on: Sat Dec 27, 2025 12:26 AMPhoto: Palash Khan/StarAir pollution in Bangladesh is not just an environmental issue — it is a public health catastrophe. It is estimated that ambient air pollution causes 90 thousand deaths every year in Bangladesh. Imagine if an industrial accident had caused as many deaths — and that too every year. Countless more people suffer from chronic illness, lost productivity, and reduced well-being. This makes air pollution an enormous burden on the economy as well.But this crisis is not hopeless. Drawing on recent research, including my own, and the insights I gained from working with policy-makers in Bangladesh, this article unpacks the air pollution challenge, clarifies common misconceptions, and proposes concrete steps that can address the problem. While many of these steps are at the level of policy and government action, I will also provide some practical measures that you, as an individual, could take to protect yourself and your family.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.THE PROBLEM OF AIR POLLUTION IN BANGLADESHAir pollution in Bangladesh is among the most severe in the world. The largest health harm is caused by very small particles — those with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (scientifically known as PM2.5). These particles are so small that they cannot be seen, and they can bypass our bodies' natural filters and enter our bloodstream when we inhale them.The World Health Organization's (WHO) guideline is that there should not be more than 5 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre of air (5 µg/m³), but in Bangladesh, the national average in 2023 was 62 µg/m³ — 12 times higher than the WHO guideline. According to the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), Bangladeshis lose, on average, 5.5 years of life expectancy compared to a scenario in which the WHO guideline is met. In districts such as Dhaka and Gazipur, more than seven years of life expectancy is lost.Air pollution affects our health by increasing the risk of many conditions, including heart attacks, strokes, respiratory infections, asthma, and lung cancer. Although it is never possible to know with certainty whether a health condition in a specific individual is caused by air pollution, research has shown that air pollution increases the share of the population that suffers from and dies of these conditions.In addition to the health costs, there is increasing evidence that air pollution substantially reduces productivity in both physically and cognitively demanding jobs. This means that high levels of air pollution make us less productive and ultimately economically poorer.Annual air pollution averages estimated from satellite data, compared with national and WHO air quality standards. Data: van Donkelaar et al. (2021).WHERE DOES THE POLLUTION COME FROM?Scientists broadly agree on the main sources:• Power generation (especially coal- and oil-fired power plants and diesel generators)• Open waste burning• Traffic (especially old buses and trucks)• Brick kilns• Other industries (e.g. steel mills and fertiliser plants)• Households burning solid fuel (e.g. firewood) for cooking• Dust from roads and construction• Natural causes such as sea salt and soil dust• Pollution entering Bangladesh from other countriesThere is still debate among scientists about how large each of these contributing sources is. What we do know is that there is no single main source that, if reduced, would allow us to solve most of the problem. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach that addresses multiple sources simultaneously will be necessary.Bangladesh is the country losing the most life expectancy to air pollution worldwide. Data: AQLI.COMMON MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT AIR POLLUTIONDespite the urgency of the situation, many misconceptions cloud public and policy understanding of air pollution in Bangladesh.1. Air pollution is primarily an outdoor problemOne widespread belief is that the worst air is outdoors, and that by staying inside, individuals can avoid its harms. But my co-authored research in Mirpur tells a different story. We found that indoor pollution levels are similar to those outside.2. Air pollution is mostly an urban problemAnother common misconception is that air pollution is mainly an issue for cities like Dhaka, while rural areas are safe. It is true that urban areas generally have higher pollution levels, but rural Bangladesh also experiences very high levels of air pollution. In other words, reducing air pollution is a priority for all of Bangladesh, not just urban areas.3. Trees are a simple solutionMany people believe that planting trees and keeping plants at home can meaningfully reduce particulate pollution. While green spaces offer many benefits, including some reduction in air pollution, these effects are small relative to the scale of Bangladesh's air pollution problem.SIX POLICY PROPOSALS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTIONIf we are to make meaningful progress, we must deploy resources where they can deliver the greatest gains in reduced air pollution at a reasonable cost. Below are my top six policy proposals that are both feasible and capable of generating large public health gains.1. Raise taxes and duties on highly polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and oil. We should tax the source of the pollution — the fuel itself — and then allow producers and consumers to determine the best alternatives, rather than having the government attempt to micro-manage the transition. In addition, these duties will raise government revenue.2. Phase out coal-fired brick kilns.

You were an active participant in that continuum of struggle. The vision at the time was to build a just, equitable and exploitation-free society in response to West Pakistan's discriminatory and extractive rule. Fifty-four years on, how far do you think today's reality has drifted from that original vision?Rehman Sobhan (RS):Bangladesh has registered progress and change in many areas since 1971. Pre-1971 disparities in every socio-economic indicator prevailed in favour of West over East Pakistan. Today we are ahead of Pakistan in virtually every development indicator from GDP to human development. Unfortunately, we are far away from constructing an exploitation-free society so that economic inequality and social disparity have widened.PA: In the two decades following independence, the country witnessed a series of political assassinations, military coups and long stretches of military rule. Yet one of the central aspirations of the Liberation War was to break free from Pakistani militarism and build a democratic society. Although democracy was revived after the 1990 mass uprising, it has stumbled repeatedly, while authoritarian and illiberal tendencies have strengthened. In your view, where does the fundamental flaw lie in our political culture, mind-set and practice?RS:Sadly, we have over 54 years not been able to build a workable and sustainable democracy. Our struggle with the Pakistani ruling elite was over the denial of democracy which remained the root cause of the economic deprivation of the Bengalis. We have, for a period from 1991 to 2008, had four relatively free and fair elections under a caretaker government in which power has been transferred to an opposition party. But even in this period of 'democratic' rule the institutions of democracy, such as parliament and the judiciary, have not functioned as they were intended to, so that a version of 'illiberal' democracy prevailed. From the introduction of the 15th Amendment doing away with the CTG, we have witnessed the ascendancy of autocratic government which culminated in an absolute monarchy. The source of the problem lies in the appropriation of power in an all-powerful leader, whether as President or elected Prime Minister, and the tribalisation of our democratic politics which has led to a winner-take-all culture.PA: The failure to fulfil the ideals of 1971, the persistence of inequality, and the democratic backsliding we have seen—did these make the 2024 mass uprising inevitable? Or do you view the events of 2024 through a different explanatory lens?RS:The uprising of July 2024 was initially inspired by the restoration of quotas for government jobs through a High Court ruling. The persistence of quotas for descendants of freedom fighters half a century after the Liberation War was quite wrong to the point of absurdity. Sheikh Hasina sensibly did away with quotas and later moved to appeal the High Court decision before the Appellate Division. Autocratic, oppressive, unjust and corrupt governance was the ultimate source of the uprising. Sheikh Hasina's unnecessary and inappropriate remarks about razakars fuelled the uprising, bringing the widespread frustrations and anger of the citizens to the surface.PA: We now see attempts by some to frame the 2024 uprising as being in opposition to the Liberation War itself. Why is this happening? Is this a temporary or isolated effort, or do you think forces opposed to the historical and political aspirations of 1971 have steadily grown stronger and are now, in the post-2024 moment, deliberately trying to undermine the legacy of the Liberation War?RS:As I have indicated above, the July uprising was inspired by democratic failure and unjust rule. Elements opposed to the Liberation War who have remained embedded in our politics took advantage of the uprising, infiltrated it, and may even have played an important role in its direction. This happens in mass upsurges against autocratic regimes where suppressed forces which have remained well organised and disciplined, even when they were repressed, can readily come into prominence when the opportunity presents itself. In the period of the interim government, they have emerged as a more visible force with strong electoral prospects. They are inclined to use this opportunity to reinterpret their historical collaborationist role with the Pakistan Army in 1971. Being led by politically astute leaders, at this stage of the political process, their position on the Liberation War is likely to be projected with some caution. It, however, remains a part of their political strategy to whitewash their role in 1971.PA: In an article for Prothom Alo this April, you wrote about Jamaat-e-Islami that, \"Although they display restraint in public rhetoric, one of their main objectives is to rewrite history so that, even if they are not seen as heroes of 1971, they at least appear as victims, portraying Bangladesh under Bangabandhu's leadership as having fought the wrong enemy in the wrong war.\" We are now seeing that this effort is not limited to Jamaat alone; some segments of the student leadership that led the uprising, along with other groups, are also attempting to write history and shape narratives in their own way. There are visible attempts from their side to marginalise or overlook the Liberation War. How do you interpret this trend?RS:The response of some of the student leadership to the Liberation War has surprised many. Such a position indicates that some elements in the movement were nurtured by anti-liberation forces and have projected such views after 5th August. Others appear to have elevated their strong antipathy to Sheikh Hasina and her party into an antipathy to Bangabandhu and the Liberation War. Both positions have become counterproductive to the political aspirations of the student movement. The role we all looked for from the students and any political party they formed was to delink themselves from the historical and partisan debates which divided the AL and BNP. The students should have projected themselves as a forward-looking force of the 21st century and emerged as a modern-minded third political force which was badly needed to enable Bangladesh to move away from our tribalised politics. Their origins from non-elitist social backgrounds could have provided them with credibility to provide an authentic voice to the concerns of the common people.PA: During Sheikh Hasina's fifteen and a half years of undemocratic rule, the rhetoric of the Liberation War was frequently used as a political instrument to repress and delegitimise the opposition. Moreover, historical discourse was narrowed to an exclusively Awami League–centric interpretation, restricting broader scholarly and civic engagement with 1971. Do you believe this environment contributed to the emergence of negative perceptions about the Liberation War among the younger generation?RS:Sheikh Hasina's initial response was motivated by the complete whitewashing of Bangabandhu and the AL from the public domain by the regimes in office between 1975 and 1996. However, when she came to power in 1996, and more so in 2008, she overplayed the image of her father and oversold the prominence and role of the AL in the Liberation War. The objective reality was that the AL was a vanguard force in the struggle for national liberation provided by the democratic mandate received through the 1970 election and the iconic role of Bangabandhu in giving leadership to the struggle for self-rule for the Bangalis. However, other political leaders and parties contributed to this struggle, while our armed forces and the common people of Bangladesh also played a critical role in the Liberation War. Their respective roles should have been more fully recognised both after liberation in 1972 and subsequently by Sheikh Hasina. To assign an exclusive position to the AL in the liberation struggle was both politically and morally wrong and has proved costly for her party as well as to the memory of the Liberation War.PA: The Awami League's prolonged use of Liberation War rhetoric has, in many ways, deepened social fractures and political divisions. How can these rifts be healed? And specifically, how can we re-engage the younger generation with the Liberation War—its history, its ideals, and the broader practice of historical inquiry?RS:We need to initiate a process of historical reconciliation through an extended programme of reasoned dialogue both at the political level and among the younger generation. This dialogue should bring all the available historical evidence into the public domain so we can arrive at a more consensual version of history based on facts rather than partisan posturing backed by rhetoric, abuse and even physical threats. The degree of misinformation and its weaponisation for political gain has clouded the understanding of an entire generation about this formative phase in our history.PA: The 2024 uprising has introduced a host of new questions about Bangladesh's society, politics, and historical trajectory. People had hoped for profound transformation, and the moment did open up such possibilities. Words like \"reform,\" \"inclusion,\" \"pluralism,\" and \"a new settlement\" echoed everywhere. Fifteen months into the uprising and the interim government, to what extent do you think popular expectations have been met?RS:Prof. Yunus and the interim government (IG) have rightly recognised that a central message of the July uprising remains that we should not go back to business as usual. The reform initiatives by various Commissions and task forces, summarised in the July Sanad, serve as a positive move to present a set of reforms which would provide Bangladesh with better governance and a more just future. Our long history with the promise of reform provided by every regime from the time of our liberation indicates that the true challenge is to implement whatever reforms or policies a government has presented to the people. In my view, implementation failure more than wrong policies has been the principal source of both democratic dysfunction and malgovernance.The lack of emphasis by the IG on improving governance through better implementation, whether of law and order or economic management, has been disappointing and a source of frustration to the people. The IG has brought about improvement in some areas, but this has not matched public expectations. In my view, the IG should have given priority to diagnosing implementation failure and should, within their short tenure, have demonstrated how policies and projects already on the statute books can be better implemented.The future of the reforms under the July Sanad, in reality, can only be implemented by an elected government which stays in office for four to five years, which provides enough time to evaluate the outcome of a reform. It is a political and juridical mistake to believe that an elected government can be bound by a Sanad mandated through a referendum. The future of such reforms will depend on the political commitment of the elected government, the strength of the elected opposition to pressure them in parliament to carry out and implement reforms, and the activism of civil society to serve as watchdogs over the passage and implementation not just of reforms but the election manifesto of the elected government.The two issues which were very much in the minds of the July uprising, pluralism and inclusion, have unfortunately not received the attention they demand. The IG government has demonstrated its own limitations in protecting women, minorities and political elements which are currently out of favour. None of the commissions, including the economic task forces, have provided any clear agenda for an inclusive development strategy, nor has the IG, through the Sanad, satisfactorily addressed the issue of pluralism. The neglect of the recommendations of the Women's Commission remains a case in point.PA: The interim government's inaction and inability to curb mob violence have emboldened the far right. Women, ethnic and religious minorities, Bauls, and followers of mazar traditions have faced attacks, and their spaces have shrunk. Major political parties have also failed to play an assertive role in protecting their rights. Liberal groups remain cornered and silent. What impact do you think this will have on our society going forward?RS:The failure of the IG to discourage and take firm action against mob violence remains conspicuous. Their failure is both a declaration of intent as well as a reflection of their weak governance capacity. Political parties have made rhetorical observations but have done little to act against such violence. Verbal abuse and instigation of violence emanating from social media remain unattended. The IG should have set standards on how to deal with such a process. It is not clear if elected political parties will be any more willing to take action to contain such forces since some of this violence emanates from political elements who now hope to get elected to the 13th Sanghsad. The failure of the IG to deal with violence has now opened up a new and more dangerous phase on the eve of elections through the resort to gun violence against particular political contestants.PA: For more than three decades, Bangladeshi politics has revolved around a rigid two-party structure. You have argued that this bipolar divide has produced a kind of tribalism in national politics. How realistic is the emergence of a third political force in Bangladesh?RS:As I pointed out earlier, we had entertained much hope that the students may emerge as a third force. Their statements, actions and efforts at forming a political party do not provide much encouragement that they will emerge as such a force. The Jamaat-e-Islami has clearly emerged as a strong political force. During and after the elections they will serve as the bipolar force in contestation with the BNP in politics and parliament, given the absence of the Awami League.The big question which no one is willing to publicly discuss is the future role of the Awami League which provided one of the two pillars of our bipolar politics. They remain a party with a 77-year history and a sizeable electoral following. Whatever their wrongdoing, this force will not wither away in our tribalised polity. This is an issue which will have to be addressed by the elected government. Failure to do so will open up an uncertain future for the workings of our 'reformed' political order.PA: In your writings and lectures, you have repeatedly emphasised the idea of an \"unfinished Liberation War.\" In your view, in what sense does our Liberation War remain incomplete? And how do we, as a nation, carry forward the unfinished journeys of that struggle?RS:The Liberation War promised democracy, secularism, socialism and nationalism. The first three principles have never been fully realised. Nor does the near future provide much prospect for their realisation. These three foundational principles of our nationhood have indeed been excluded from the July Sanad. The idea of nationalism remains contested even after 54 years. I fear that my own political journey, at the age of 90, may remain unfinished.The interview was originally published in Bangla by Prothom Alo on December 16, 2025.

You were an active participant in that continuum of struggle. The vision at the time was to build a just, equitable and exploitation-free society in response to West Pakistan's discriminatory and extractive rule. Fifty-four years on, how far do you think today's reality has drifted from that original vision?Rehman Sobhan (RS):Bangladesh has registered progress and change in many areas since 1971. Pre-1971 disparities in every socio-economic indicator prevailed in favour of West over East Pakistan. Today we are ahead of Pakistan in virtually every development indicator from GDP to human development. Unfortunately, we are far away from constructing an exploitation-free society so that economic inequality and social disparity have widened.PA: In the two decades following independence, the country witnessed a series of political assassinations, military coups and long stretches of military rule.

However, other political leaders and parties contributed to this struggle, while our armed forces and the common people of Bangladesh also played a critical role in the Liberation War. Their respective roles should have been more fully recognised both after liberation in 1972 and subsequently by Sheikh Hasina. To assign an exclusive position to the AL in the liberation struggle was both politically and morally wrong and has proved costly for her party as well as to the memory of the Liberation War.PA: The Awami League's prolonged use of Liberation War rhetoric has, in many ways, deepened social fractures and political divisions. How can these rifts be healed? And specifically, how can we re-engage the younger generation with the Liberation War—its history, its ideals, and the broader practice of historical inquiry?RS:We need to initiate a process of historical reconciliation through an extended programme of reasoned dialogue both at the political level and among the younger generation. This dialogue should bring all the available historical evidence into the public domain so we can arrive at a more consensual version of history based on facts rather than partisan posturing backed by rhetoric, abuse and even physical threats. The degree of misinformation and its weaponisation for political gain has clouded the understanding of an entire generation about this formative phase in our history.PA: The 2024 uprising has introduced a host of new questions about Bangladesh's society, politics, and historical trajectory. People had hoped for profound transformation, and the moment did open up such possibilities. Words like \"reform,\" \"inclusion,\" \"pluralism,\" and \"a new settlement\" echoed everywhere. Fifteen months into the uprising and the interim government, to what extent do you think popular expectations have been met?RS:Prof. Yunus and the interim government (IG) have rightly recognised that a central message of the July uprising remains that we should not go back to business as usual. The reform initiatives by various Commissions and task forces, summarised in the July Sanad, serve as a positive move to present a set of reforms which would provide Bangladesh with better governance and a more just future. Our long history with the promise of reform provided by every regime from the time of our liberation indicates that the true challenge is to implement whatever reforms or policies a government has presented to the people. In my view, implementation failure more than wrong policies has been the principal source of both democratic dysfunction and malgovernance.The lack of emphasis by the IG on improving governance through better implementation, whether of law and order or economic management, has been disappointing and a source of frustration to the people. The IG has brought about improvement in some areas, but this has not matched public expectations. In my view, the IG should have given priority to diagnosing implementation failure and should, within their short tenure, have demonstrated how policies and projects already on the statute books can be better implemented.The future of the reforms under the July Sanad, in reality, can only be implemented by an elected government which stays in office for four to five years, which provides enough time to evaluate the outcome of a reform. It is a political and juridical mistake to believe that an elected government can be bound by a Sanad mandated through a referendum. The future of such reforms will depend on the political commitment of the elected government, the strength of the elected opposition to pressure them in parliament to carry out and implement reforms, and the activism of civil society to serve as watchdogs over the passage and implementation not just of reforms but the election manifesto of the elected government.The two issues which were very much in the minds of the July uprising, pluralism and inclusion, have unfortunately not received the attention they demand. The IG government has demonstrated its own limitations in protecting women, minorities and political elements which are currently out of favour. None of the commissions, including the economic task forces, have provided any clear agenda for an inclusive development strategy, nor has the IG, through the Sanad, satisfactorily addressed the issue of pluralism. The neglect of the recommendations of the Women's Commission remains a case in point.PA: The interim government's inaction and inability to curb mob violence have emboldened the far right. Women, ethnic and religious minorities, Bauls, and followers of mazar traditions have faced attacks, and their spaces have shrunk. Major political parties have also failed to play an assertive role in protecting their rights. Liberal groups remain cornered and silent. What impact do you think this will have on our society going forward?RS:The failure of the IG to discourage and take firm action against mob violence remains conspicuous. Their failure is both a declaration of intent as well as a reflection of their weak governance capacity. Political parties have made rhetorical observations but have done little to act against such violence. Verbal abuse and instigation of violence emanating from social media remain unattended. The IG should have set standards on how to deal with such a process. It is not clear if elected political parties will be any more willing to take action to contain such forces since some of this violence emanates from political elements who now hope to get elected to the 13th Sanghsad. The failure of the IG to deal with violence has now opened up a new and more dangerous phase on the eve of elections through the resort to gun violence against particular political contestants.PA: For more than three decades, Bangladeshi politics has revolved around a rigid two-party structure. You have argued that this bipolar divide has produced a kind of tribalism in national politics. How realistic is the emergence of a third political force in Bangladesh?RS:As I pointed out earlier, we had entertained much hope that the students may emerge as a third force. Their statements, actions and efforts at forming a political party do not provide much encouragement that they will emerge as such a force. The Jamaat-e-Islami has clearly emerged as a strong political force. During and after the elections they will serve as the bipolar force in contestation with the BNP in politics and parliament, given the absence of the Awami League.The big question which no one is willing to publicly discuss is the future role of the Awami League which provided one of the two pillars of our bipolar politics. They remain a party with a 77-year history and a sizeable electoral following. Whatever their wrongdoing, this force will not wither away in our tribalised polity. This is an issue which will have to be addressed by the elected government. Failure to do so will open up an uncertain future for the workings of our 'reformed' political order.PA: In your writings and lectures, you have repeatedly emphasised the idea of an \"unfinished Liberation War.\" In your view, in what sense does our Liberation War remain incomplete? And how do we, as a nation, carry forward the unfinished journeys of that struggle?RS:The Liberation War promised democracy, secularism, socialism and nationalism. The first three principles have never been fully realised. Nor does the near future provide much prospect for their realisation. These three foundational principles of our nationhood have indeed been excluded from the July Sanad. The idea of nationalism remains contested even after 54 years. I fear that my own political journey, at the age of 90, may remain unfinished.The interview was originally published in Bangla by Prothom Alo on December 16, 2025.

You were an active participant in that continuum of struggle. The vision at the time was to build a just, equitable and exploitation-free society in response to West Pakistan's discriminatory and extractive rule. Fifty-four years on, how far do you think today's reality has drifted from that original vision?Rehman Sobhan (RS):Bangladesh has registered progress and change in many areas since 1971. Pre-1971 disparities in every socio-economic indicator prevailed in favour of West over East Pakistan. Today we are ahead of Pakistan in virtually every development indicator from GDP to human development. Unfortunately, we are far away from constructing an exploitation-free society so that economic inequality and social disparity have widened.PA: In the two decades following independence, the country witnessed a series of political assassinations, military coups and long stretches of military rule. Yet one of the central aspirations of the Liberation War was to break free from Pakistani militarism and build a democratic society. Although democracy was revived after the 1990 mass uprising, it has stumbled repeatedly, while authoritarian and illiberal tendencies have strengthened. In your view, where does the fundamental flaw lie in our political culture, mind-set and practice?RS:Sadly, we have over 54 years not been able to build a workable and sustainable democracy. Our struggle with the Pakistani ruling elite was over the denial of democracy which remained the root cause of the economic deprivation of the Bengalis. We have, for a period from 1991 to 2008, had four relatively free and fair elections under a caretaker government in which power has been transferred to an opposition party. But even in this period of 'democratic' rule the institutions of democracy, such as parliament and the judiciary, have not functioned as they were intended to, so that a version of 'illiberal' democracy prevailed. From the introduction of the 15th Amendment doing away with the CTG, we have witnessed the ascendancy of autocratic government which culminated in an absolute monarchy. The source of the problem lies in the appropriation of power in an all-powerful leader, whether as President or elected Prime Minister, and the tribalisation of our democratic politics which has led to a winner-take-all culture.PA: The failure to fulfil the ideals of 1971, the persistence of inequality, and the democratic backsliding we have seen—did these make the 2024 mass uprising inevitable? Or do you view the events of 2024 through a different explanatory lens?RS:The uprising of July 2024 was initially inspired by the restoration of quotas for government jobs through a High Court ruling. The persistence of quotas for descendants of freedom fighters half a century after the Liberation War was quite wrong to the point of absurdity. Sheikh Hasina sensibly did away with quotas and later moved to appeal the High Court decision before the Appellate Division. Autocratic, oppressive, unjust and corrupt governance was the ultimate source of the uprising. Sheikh Hasina's unnecessary and inappropriate remarks about razakars fuelled the uprising, bringing the widespread frustrations and anger of the citizens to the surface.PA: We now see attempts by some to frame the 2024 uprising as being in opposition to the Liberation War itself. Why is this happening? Is this a temporary or isolated effort, or do you think forces opposed to the historical and political aspirations of 1971 have steadily grown stronger and are now, in the post-2024 moment, deliberately trying to undermine the legacy of the Liberation War?RS:As I have indicated above, the July uprising was inspired by democratic failure and unjust rule. Elements opposed to the Liberation War who have remained embedded in our politics took advantage of the uprising, infiltrated it, and may even have played an important role in its direction. This happens in mass upsurges against autocratic regimes where suppressed forces which have remained well organised and disciplined, even when they were repressed, can readily come into prominence when the opportunity presents itself. In the period of the interim government, they have emerged as a more visible force with strong electoral prospects. They are inclined to use this opportunity to reinterpret their historical collaborationist role with the Pakistan Army in 1971. Being led by politically astute leaders, at this stage of the political process, their position on the Liberation War is likely to be projected with some caution. It, however, remains a part of their political strategy to whitewash their role in 1971.PA: In an article for Prothom Alo this April, you wrote about Jamaat-e-Islami that, \"Although they display restraint in public rhetoric, one of their main objectives is to rewrite history so that, even if they are not seen as heroes of 1971, they at least appear as victims, portraying Bangladesh under Bangabandhu's leadership as having fought the wrong enemy in the wrong war.\" We are now seeing that this effort is not limited to Jamaat alone; some segments of the student leadership that led the uprising, along with other groups, are also attempting to write history and shape narratives in their own way. There are visible attempts from their side to marginalise or overlook the Liberation War. How do you interpret this trend?RS:The response of some of the student leadership to the Liberation War has surprised many. Such a position indicates that some elements in the movement were nurtured by anti-liberation forces and have projected such views after 5th August. Others appear to have elevated their strong antipathy to Sheikh Hasina and her party into an antipathy to Bangabandhu and the Liberation War. Both positions have become counterproductive to the political aspirations of the student movement. The role we all looked for from the students and any political party they formed was to delink themselves from the historical and partisan debates which divided the AL and BNP. The students should have projected themselves as a forward-looking force of the 21st century and emerged as a modern-minded third political force which was badly needed to enable Bangladesh to move away from our tribalised politics. Their origins from non-elitist social backgrounds could have provided them with credibility to provide an authentic voice to the concerns of the common people.PA: During Sheikh Hasina's fifteen and a half years of undemocratic rule, the rhetoric of the Liberation War was frequently used as a political instrument to repress and delegitimise the opposition. Moreover, historical discourse was narrowed to an exclusively Awami League–centric interpretation, restricting broader scholarly and civic engagement with 1971. Do you believe this environment contributed to the emergence of negative perceptions about the Liberation War among the younger generation?RS:Sheikh Hasina's initial response was motivated by the complete whitewashing of Bangabandhu and the AL from the public domain by the regimes in office between 1975 and 1996. However, when she came to power in 1996, and more so in 2008, she overplayed the image of her father and oversold the prominence and role of the AL in the Liberation War. The objective reality was that the AL was a vanguard force in the struggle for national liberation provided by the democratic mandate received through the 1970 election and the iconic role of Bangabandhu in giving leadership to the struggle for self-rule for the Bangalis.

And how do we, as a nation, carry forward the unfinished journeys of that struggle?RS:The Liberation War promised democracy, secularism, socialism and nationalism. The first three principles have never been fully realised. Nor does the near future provide much prospect for their realisation. These three foundational principles of our nationhood have indeed been excluded from the July Sanad. The idea of nationalism remains contested even after 54 years. I fear that my own political journey, at the age of 90, may remain unfinished.The interview was originally published in Bangla by Prothom Alo on December 16, 2025.

You were an active participant in that continuum of struggle. The vision at the time was to build a just, equitable and exploitation-free society in response to West Pakistan's discriminatory and extractive rule. Fifty-four years on, how far do you think today's reality has drifted from that original vision?Rehman Sobhan (RS):Bangladesh has registered progress and change in many areas since 1971. Pre-1971 disparities in every socio-economic indicator prevailed in favour of West over East Pakistan. Today we are ahead of Pakistan in virtually every development indicator from GDP to human development. Unfortunately, we are far away from constructing an exploitation-free society so that economic inequality and social disparity have widened.PA: In the two decades following independence, the country witnessed a series of political assassinations, military coups and long stretches of military rule. Yet one of the central aspirations of the Liberation War was to break free from Pakistani militarism and build a democratic society. Although democracy was revived after the 1990 mass uprising, it has stumbled repeatedly, while authoritarian and illiberal tendencies have strengthened. In your view, where does the fundamental flaw lie in our political culture, mind-set and practice?RS:Sadly, we have over 54 years not been able to build a workable and sustainable democracy. Our struggle with the Pakistani ruling elite was over the denial of democracy which remained the root cause of the economic deprivation of the Bengalis. We have, for a period from 1991 to 2008, had four relatively free and fair elections under a caretaker government in which power has been transferred to an opposition party. But even in this period of 'democratic' rule the institutions of democracy, such as parliament and the judiciary, have not functioned as they were intended to, so that a version of 'illiberal' democracy prevailed. From the introduction of the 15th Amendment doing away with the CTG, we have witnessed the ascendancy of autocratic government which culminated in an absolute monarchy. The source of the problem lies in the appropriation of power in an all-powerful leader, whether as President or elected Prime Minister, and the tribalisation of our democratic politics which has led to a winner-take-all culture.PA: The failure to fulfil the ideals of 1971, the persistence of inequality, and the democratic backsliding we have seen—did these make the 2024 mass uprising inevitable? Or do you view the events of 2024 through a different explanatory lens?RS:The uprising of July 2024 was initially inspired by the restoration of quotas for government jobs through a High Court ruling. The persistence of quotas for descendants of freedom fighters half a century after the Liberation War was quite wrong to the point of absurdity. Sheikh Hasina sensibly did away with quotas and later moved to appeal the High Court decision before the Appellate Division. Autocratic, oppressive, unjust and corrupt governance was the ultimate source of the uprising. Sheikh Hasina's unnecessary and inappropriate remarks about razakars fuelled the uprising, bringing the widespread frustrations and anger of the citizens to the surface.PA: We now see attempts by some to frame the 2024 uprising as being in opposition to the Liberation War itself. Why is this happening? Is this a temporary or isolated effort, or do you think forces opposed to the historical and political aspirations of 1971 have steadily grown stronger and are now, in the post-2024 moment, deliberately trying to undermine the legacy of the Liberation War?RS:As I have indicated above, the July uprising was inspired by democratic failure and unjust rule. Elements opposed to the Liberation War who have remained embedded in our politics took advantage of the uprising, infiltrated it, and may even have played an important role in its direction. This happens in mass upsurges against autocratic regimes where suppressed forces which have remained well organised and disciplined, even when they were repressed, can readily come into prominence when the opportunity presents itself. In the period of the interim government, they have emerged as a more visible force with strong electoral prospects. They are inclined to use this opportunity to reinterpret their historical collaborationist role with the Pakistan Army in 1971. Being led by politically astute leaders, at this stage of the political process, their position on the Liberation War is likely to be projected with some caution. It, however, remains a part of their political strategy to whitewash their role in 1971.PA: In an article for Prothom Alo this April, you wrote about Jamaat-e-Islami that, \"Although they display restraint in public rhetoric, one of their main objectives is to rewrite history so that, even if they are not seen as heroes of 1971, they at least appear as victims, portraying Bangladesh under Bangabandhu's leadership as having fought the wrong enemy in the wrong war.\" We are now seeing that this effort is not limited to Jamaat alone; some segments of the student leadership that led the uprising, along with other groups, are also attempting to write history and shape narratives in their own way. There are visible attempts from their side to marginalise or overlook the Liberation War. How do you interpret this trend?RS:The response of some of the student leadership to the Liberation War has surprised many. Such a position indicates that some elements in the movement were nurtured by anti-liberation forces and have projected such views after 5th August. Others appear to have elevated their strong antipathy to Sheikh Hasina and her party into an antipathy to Bangabandhu and the Liberation War. Both positions have become counterproductive to the political aspirations of the student movement. The role we all looked for from the students and any political party they formed was to delink themselves from the historical and partisan debates which divided the AL and BNP. The students should have projected themselves as a forward-looking force of the 21st century and emerged as a modern-minded third political force which was badly needed to enable Bangladesh to move away from our tribalised politics. Their origins from non-elitist social backgrounds could have provided them with credibility to provide an authentic voice to the concerns of the common people.PA: During Sheikh Hasina's fifteen and a half years of undemocratic rule, the rhetoric of the Liberation War was frequently used as a political instrument to repress and delegitimise the opposition. Moreover, historical discourse was narrowed to an exclusively Awami League–centric interpretation, restricting broader scholarly and civic engagement with 1971. Do you believe this environment contributed to the emergence of negative perceptions about the Liberation War among the younger generation?RS:Sheikh Hasina's initial response was motivated by the complete whitewashing of Bangabandhu and the AL from the public domain by the regimes in office between 1975 and 1996. However, when she came to power in 1996, and more so in 2008, she overplayed the image of her father and oversold the prominence and role of the AL in the Liberation War. The objective reality was that the AL was a vanguard force in the struggle for national liberation provided by the democratic mandate received through the 1970 election and the iconic role of Bangabandhu in giving leadership to the struggle for self-rule for the Bangalis. However, other political leaders and parties contributed to this struggle, while our armed forces and the common people of Bangladesh also played a critical role in the Liberation War. Their respective roles should have been more fully recognised both after liberation in 1972 and subsequently by Sheikh Hasina. To assign an exclusive position to the AL in the liberation struggle was both politically and morally wrong and has proved costly for her party as well as to the memory of the Liberation War.PA: The Awami League's prolonged use of Liberation War rhetoric has, in many ways, deepened social fractures and political divisions. How can these rifts be healed? And specifically, how can we re-engage the younger generation with the Liberation War—its history, its ideals, and the broader practice of historical inquiry?RS:We need to initiate a process of historical reconciliation through an extended programme of reasoned dialogue both at the political level and among the younger generation. This dialogue should bring all the available historical evidence into the public domain so we can arrive at a more consensual version of history based on facts rather than partisan posturing backed by rhetoric, abuse and even physical threats. The degree of misinformation and its weaponisation for political gain has clouded the understanding of an entire generation about this formative phase in our history.PA: The 2024 uprising has introduced a host of new questions about Bangladesh's society, politics, and historical trajectory. People had hoped for profound transformation, and the moment did open up such possibilities. Words like \"reform,\" \"inclusion,\" \"pluralism,\" and \"a new settlement\" echoed everywhere. Fifteen months into the uprising and the interim government, to what extent do you think popular expectations have been met?RS:Prof. Yunus and the interim government (IG) have rightly recognised that a central message of the July uprising remains that we should not go back to business as usual. The reform initiatives by various Commissions and task forces, summarised in the July Sanad, serve as a positive move to present a set of reforms which would provide Bangladesh with better governance and a more just future. Our long history with the promise of reform provided by every regime from the time of our liberation indicates that the true challenge is to implement whatever reforms or policies a government has presented to the people. In my view, implementation failure more than wrong policies has been the principal source of both democratic dysfunction and malgovernance.The lack of emphasis by the IG on improving governance through better implementation, whether of law and order or economic management, has been disappointing and a source of frustration to the people. The IG has brought about improvement in some areas, but this has not matched public expectations. In my view, the IG should have given priority to diagnosing implementation failure and should, within their short tenure, have demonstrated how policies and projects already on the statute books can be better implemented.The future of the reforms under the July Sanad, in reality, can only be implemented by an elected government which stays in office for four to five years, which provides enough time to evaluate the outcome of a reform. It is a political and juridical mistake to believe that an elected government can be bound by a Sanad mandated through a referendum. The future of such reforms will depend on the political commitment of the elected government, the strength of the elected opposition to pressure them in parliament to carry out and implement reforms, and the activism of civil society to serve as watchdogs over the passage and implementation not just of reforms but the election manifesto of the elected government.The two issues which were very much in the minds of the July uprising, pluralism and inclusion, have unfortunately not received the attention they demand. The IG government has demonstrated its own limitations in protecting women, minorities and political elements which are currently out of favour. None of the commissions, including the economic task forces, have provided any clear agenda for an inclusive development strategy, nor has the IG, through the Sanad, satisfactorily addressed the issue of pluralism. The neglect of the recommendations of the Women's Commission remains a case in point.PA: The interim government's inaction and inability to curb mob violence have emboldened the far right. Women, ethnic and religious minorities, Bauls, and followers of mazar traditions have faced attacks, and their spaces have shrunk. Major political parties have also failed to play an assertive role in protecting their rights. Liberal groups remain cornered and silent. What impact do you think this will have on our society going forward?RS:The failure of the IG to discourage and take firm action against mob violence remains conspicuous. Their failure is both a declaration of intent as well as a reflection of their weak governance capacity. Political parties have made rhetorical observations but have done little to act against such violence. Verbal abuse and instigation of violence emanating from social media remain unattended. The IG should have set standards on how to deal with such a process. It is not clear if elected political parties will be any more willing to take action to contain such forces since some of this violence emanates from political elements who now hope to get elected to the 13th Sanghsad. The failure of the IG to deal with violence has now opened up a new and more dangerous phase on the eve of elections through the resort to gun violence against particular political contestants.PA: For more than three decades, Bangladeshi politics has revolved around a rigid two-party structure. You have argued that this bipolar divide has produced a kind of tribalism in national politics. How realistic is the emergence of a third political force in Bangladesh?RS:As I pointed out earlier, we had entertained much hope that the students may emerge as a third force. Their statements, actions and efforts at forming a political party do not provide much encouragement that they will emerge as such a force. The Jamaat-e-Islami has clearly emerged as a strong political force. During and after the elections they will serve as the bipolar force in contestation with the BNP in politics and parliament, given the absence of the Awami League.The big question which no one is willing to publicly discuss is the future role of the Awami League which provided one of the two pillars of our bipolar politics. They remain a party with a 77-year history and a sizeable electoral following. Whatever their wrongdoing, this force will not wither away in our tribalised polity. This is an issue which will have to be addressed by the elected government. Failure to do so will open up an uncertain future for the workings of our 'reformed' political order.PA: In your writings and lectures, you have repeatedly emphasised the idea of an \"unfinished Liberation War.\" In your view, in what sense does our Liberation War remain incomplete? And how do we, as a nation, carry forward the unfinished journeys of that struggle?RS:The Liberation War promised democracy, secularism, socialism and nationalism. The first three principles have never been fully realised. Nor does the near future provide much prospect for their realisation. These three foundational principles of our nationhood have indeed been excluded from the July Sanad. The idea of nationalism remains contested even after 54 years. I fear that my own political journey, at the age of 90, may remain unfinished.The interview was originally published in Bangla by Prothom Alo on December 16, 2025.

The military junta's attempt to stage national polls is driven by a need to project legitimacy at a time when its authority is deeply eroded. Large sections of the country, particularly along the northern, eastern, and western borderlands, are controlled by ethnic armed organisations and resistance forces. These groups have carved out autonomous zones with their own administrations, revenue collection systems, and security structures. China-brokered ceasefire agreements have contained battles in some areas, but they have not restored central authority. Instead, they have produced a patchwork governance order, with competing jurisdictions responding to different political patrons. In such a fragmented environment, an election becomes an exercise in performance rather than a mechanism for political settlement.The Rohingya question and the politics of erasureFor the Rohingya, the election offers no meaningful pathway toward recognition, rights, or safety. Their exclusion from Myanmar's political community has been entrenched for decades and was violently reinforced by the 2017 mass atrocities that pushed nearly a million refugees into Bangladesh. The current electoral framework preserves this architecture of exclusion. No major political force in Myanmar – whether aligned with the junta or opposed to it – has articulated a vision for reintegrating the Rohingya into national life. The civil war has further marginalised their plight, pushing the question of citizenship and accountability to the outer edges of political discourse.For Bangladesh, this political void has immediate implications. The prolonged instability inside Myanmar has stalled repatriation efforts and diminished the prospects for creating conditions conducive to a safe return. As host communities in Cox's Bazar shoulder the social and economic weight of the refugee population, it becomes increasingly clear that no progress is possible without structural change in Myanmar's political order. The election does not create that change; it simply reproduces the conditions that have locked the Rohingya crisis into a dangerous stalemate.Rohingya camps at Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. File Photo: Anisur RahmanChina's expanding strategic footprintMyanmar's internal conflict has become intertwined with China's strategic interests, making Beijing the most consequential external actor in shaping the country's trajectory. China's engagement is defined by a deliberate duality. It maintains formal ties with the junta to safeguard major infrastructure and energy projects, including pipelines and economic corridors that cut across contested terrain. Simultaneously, it maintains relationships with ethnic armed organisations that control border areas essential to Chinese trade and security. This multipronged approach allows Beijing to cultivate influence without committing to a political settlement. Its priority remains border stability, uninterrupted commercial activity, and the protection of long-term strategic assets.This strategy reflects a broader regional pattern in which China prefers calibrated involvement over transformative engagement. Its deepening role in Myanmar signals to neighbouring states, including Bangladesh, that Beijing's approach to crises in its periphery is rooted in pragmatism rather than normative considerations. The geopolitical space China occupies in Myanmar is thus not simply a matter of influence; it is part of a wider reordering of power in mainland Southeast Asia.India's security dilemma on its Eastern frontierIndia faces a more complex challenge. Instability in Myanmar has reverberated across its northeastern borderlands, contributing to refugee inflows, illicit cross-border movements, and the resurgence of armed groups with long-standing grievances. New Delhi once viewed the Myanmar military as a critical partner for stabilising this frontier and for advancing connectivity projects central to the Act East policy. However, the military's weakening grip over territory has undermined this equation. Key infrastructure initiatives, including the Kaladan project and the trilateral highway, have been repeatedly disrupted by conflict and logistical insecurity. Local political sensitivities in Manipur and Mizoram further constrain India's ability to deepen engagement with Myanmar's military authorities.An election campaign billboard for the Union Solidarity and Development party in Shan state. Photo: AFP/Getty ImagesThe upcoming election does little to resolve these pressures. Rather, it underscores the limits of relying on a regime that cannot assert control over its own territory. As India weighs its options, it confronts the uncomfortable reality that Myanmar's internal fragmentation directly impacts its regional ambitions and border management strategies.ASEAN's constraints and the limits of regional diplomacyASEAN, long positioned as Myanmar's diplomatic anchor, has struggled to craft a coherent or influential response. The bloc's non-interference principle, coupled with internal political divisions, has hampered efforts to enforce its Five-Point Consensus or to pressure the junta toward substantive concessions. Some member states favour a tougher stance, while others prioritise stability and engagement. This divergence has produced a crisis of relevance for ASEAN, whose diplomatic interventions increasingly appear symbolic rather than effective. The election is unlikely to reverse this trend; instead, it highlights the bloc's structural inability to shape Myanmar's trajectory in a meaningful way.Regional fatigue has also become evident. Years of conflict, humanitarian suffering, and stalled negotiations have created a sense of diplomatic inertia. While ASEAN remains formally engaged, its capacity to influence events inside Myanmar continues to diminish, leaving a vacuum into which other powers have stepped.The military junta in Myanmar, which came to power by toppling the elected government in February 2021, seems to be in deep trouble. File Photo: REUTERSWestern pressure and its limitsWestern governments maintain a normative stance on Myanmar, rejecting the junta's legitimacy and implementing sanctions targeting military-linked businesses and key individuals. However, the impact of these measures has been limited. The military continues to draw revenue from border trade, resource extraction, and channels supported by regional powers. Moreover, Myanmar does not occupy a central place in Western strategic priorities compared with broader Indo-Pacific calculations centred on China's rise. This imbalance between moral condemnation and strategic commitment has created space for the junta to endure, even as it faces international isolation.Bangladesh in a complicated geopolitical landscapeFor Bangladesh, the geopolitical stakes are profound and multifaceted. The crisis in Myanmar intersects with national security concerns, humanitarian responsibilities, and regional diplomatic pressures. Bangladesh must navigate a delicate balance: maintaining a working relationship with the junta for the sake of repatriation, engaging China and ASEAN to sustain diplomatic momentum, and coordinating with Western partners and UN agencies to keep the Rohingya issue on the global agenda. These competing imperatives require strategic flexibility rather than alignment with any single external power.Instability in Myanmar also complicates regional visions for connectivity and economic integration. Bangladesh's aspirations to benefit from broader Bay of Bengal and Indo-Pacific frameworks depend on a stable neighbourhood. A fragmented state on its southeastern border disrupts these opportunities and forces Dhaka to adapt its strategic outlook.Supporters of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) wave party flags in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on October 28, 2025. Photo: Aung Shine Oo/APMyanmar as a regional pressure pointMyanmar's election reflects a deeper reality: the country has become a pressure point in the geopolitical contestations shaping South and Southeast Asia. Its internal fragmentation invites external involvement, while its location at the crossroads of multiple strategic corridors ensures that regional and global powers cannot ignore its trajectory. For Bangladesh, India, China, ASEAN, and Western governments, Myanmar represents both a humanitarian challenge and a strategic variable.Beyond the illusion of political normalcyMyanmar's election is unlikely to alter the fundamental drivers of conflict within the country. It is an exercise in political theatre designed to project normalcy in a state where legitimacy is fractured and authority contested. Yet its implications extend far beyond Myanmar's borders. The crisis continues to shape regional security dynamics, redraw geopolitical alignments, and impose strategic burdens on neighbouring states—none more so than Bangladesh.A clear-eyed understanding of these dynamics is essential. For Bangladesh and the region, the path forward lies not in hoping for rapid political transformation within Myanmar but in preparing for a prolonged period of instability that will demand sustained diplomatic engagement, strategic patience, and resilient humanitarian management.ASM Tarek Hassan Semul,Research Fellow, Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Cohort of the Indo-Pacific Young Leaders Program, Asia Pacific Foundation (APF), Canada.Send your articles forSlow Readsto[email protected].

It maintains formal ties with the junta to safeguard major infrastructure and energy projects, including pipelines and economic corridors that cut across contested terrain. Simultaneously, it maintains relationships with ethnic armed organisations that control border areas essential to Chinese trade and security. This multipronged approach allows Beijing to cultivate influence without committing to a political settlement. Its priority remains border stability, uninterrupted commercial activity, and the protection of long-term strategic assets.This strategy reflects a broader regional pattern in which China prefers calibrated involvement over transformative engagement. Its deepening role in Myanmar signals to neighbouring states, including Bangladesh, that Beijing's approach to crises in its periphery is rooted in pragmatism rather than normative considerations. The geopolitical space China occupies in Myanmar is thus not simply a matter of influence; it is part of a wider reordering of power in mainland Southeast Asia.India's security dilemma on its Eastern frontierIndia faces a more complex challenge. Instability in Myanmar has reverberated across its northeastern borderlands, contributing to refugee inflows, illicit cross-border movements, and the resurgence of armed groups with long-standing grievances. New Delhi once viewed the Myanmar military as a critical partner for stabilising this frontier and for advancing connectivity projects central to the Act East policy. However, the military's weakening grip over territory has undermined this equation. Key infrastructure initiatives, including the Kaladan project and the trilateral highway, have been repeatedly disrupted by conflict and logistical insecurity. Local political sensitivities in Manipur and Mizoram further constrain India's ability to deepen engagement with Myanmar's military authorities.An election campaign billboard for the Union Solidarity and Development party in Shan state. Photo: AFP/Getty ImagesThe upcoming election does little to resolve these pressures. Rather, it underscores the limits of relying on a regime that cannot assert control over its own territory. As India weighs its options, it confronts the uncomfortable reality that Myanmar's internal fragmentation directly impacts its regional ambitions and border management strategies.ASEAN's constraints and the limits of regional diplomacyASEAN, long positioned as Myanmar's diplomatic anchor, has struggled to craft a coherent or influential response. The bloc's non-interference principle, coupled with internal political divisions, has hampered efforts to enforce its Five-Point Consensus or to pressure the junta toward substantive concessions. Some member states favour a tougher stance, while others prioritise stability and engagement. This divergence has produced a crisis of relevance for ASEAN, whose diplomatic interventions increasingly appear symbolic rather than effective. The election is unlikely to reverse this trend; instead, it highlights the bloc's structural inability to shape Myanmar's trajectory in a meaningful way.Regional fatigue has also become evident. Years of conflict, humanitarian suffering, and stalled negotiations have created a sense of diplomatic inertia. While ASEAN remains formally engaged, its capacity to influence events inside Myanmar continues to diminish, leaving a vacuum into which other powers have stepped.The military junta in Myanmar, which came to power by toppling the elected government in February 2021, seems to be in deep trouble. File Photo: REUTERSWestern pressure and its limitsWestern governments maintain a normative stance on Myanmar, rejecting the junta's legitimacy and implementing sanctions targeting military-linked businesses and key individuals. However, the impact of these measures has been limited. The military continues to draw revenue from border trade, resource extraction, and channels supported by regional powers. Moreover, Myanmar does not occupy a central place in Western strategic priorities compared with broader Indo-Pacific calculations centred on China's rise. This imbalance between moral condemnation and strategic commitment has created space for the junta to endure, even as it faces international isolation.Bangladesh in a complicated geopolitical landscapeFor Bangladesh, the geopolitical stakes are profound and multifaceted. The crisis in Myanmar intersects with national security concerns, humanitarian responsibilities, and regional diplomatic pressures. Bangladesh must navigate a delicate balance: maintaining a working relationship with the junta for the sake of repatriation, engaging China and ASEAN to sustain diplomatic momentum, and coordinating with Western partners and UN agencies to keep the Rohingya issue on the global agenda. These competing imperatives require strategic flexibility rather than alignment with any single external power.Instability in Myanmar also complicates regional visions for connectivity and economic integration. Bangladesh's aspirations to benefit from broader Bay of Bengal and Indo-Pacific frameworks depend on a stable neighbourhood. A fragmented state on its southeastern border disrupts these opportunities and forces Dhaka to adapt its strategic outlook.Supporters of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) wave party flags in Naypyidaw, Myanmar, on October 28, 2025.

Its internal fragmentation invites external involvement, while its location at the crossroads of multiple strategic corridors ensures that regional and global powers cannot ignore its trajectory. For Bangladesh, India, China, ASEAN, and Western governments, Myanmar represents both a humanitarian challenge and a strategic variable.Beyond the illusion of political normalcyMyanmar's election is unlikely to alter the fundamental drivers of conflict within the country. It is an exercise in political theatre designed to project normalcy in a state where legitimacy is fractured and authority contested. Yet its implications extend far beyond Myanmar's borders. The crisis continues to shape regional security dynamics, redraw geopolitical alignments, and impose strategic burdens on neighbouring states—none more so than Bangladesh.A clear-eyed understanding of these dynamics is essential. For Bangladesh and the region, the path forward lies not in hoping for rapid political transformation within Myanmar but in preparing for a prolonged period of instability that will demand sustained diplomatic engagement, strategic patience, and resilient humanitarian management.ASM Tarek Hassan Semul,Research Fellow, Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Cohort of the Indo-Pacific Young Leaders Program, Asia Pacific Foundation (APF), Canada.Send your articles forSlow Readsto[email protected].

The military junta's attempt to stage national polls is driven by a need to project legitimacy at a time when its authority is deeply eroded. Large sections of the country, particularly along the northern, eastern, and western borderlands, are controlled by ethnic armed organisations and resistance forces. These groups have carved out autonomous zones with their own administrations, revenue collection systems, and security structures. China-brokered ceasefire agreements have contained battles in some areas, but they have not restored central authority. Instead, they have produced a patchwork governance order, with competing jurisdictions responding to different political patrons. In such a fragmented environment, an election becomes an exercise in performance rather than a mechanism for political settlement.The Rohingya question and the politics of erasureFor the Rohingya, the election offers no meaningful pathway toward recognition, rights, or safety. Their exclusion from Myanmar's political community has been entrenched for decades and was violently reinforced by the 2017 mass atrocities that pushed nearly a million refugees into Bangladesh. The current electoral framework preserves this architecture of exclusion. No major political force in Myanmar – whether aligned with the junta or opposed to it – has articulated a vision for reintegrating the Rohingya into national life. The civil war has further marginalised their plight, pushing the question of citizenship and accountability to the outer edges of political discourse.For Bangladesh, this political void has immediate implications. The prolonged instability inside Myanmar has stalled repatriation efforts and diminished the prospects for creating conditions conducive to a safe return. As host communities in Cox's Bazar shoulder the social and economic weight of the refugee population, it becomes increasingly clear that no progress is possible without structural change in Myanmar's political order. The election does not create that change; it simply reproduces the conditions that have locked the Rohingya crisis into a dangerous stalemate.Rohingya camps at Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.

A father paused at a footpath stall while his son stood beside him, restless and close to tears. The stall was filled with plastic horns, balloons, whistles, but the child kept pointing at the same thing. Among the bright, forgettable objects, a small green and red flag, hung on a thick bamboo stick. As his father placed the flag in his hand, he leaned down and whispered, \"Careful.\" The word felt heavier than the flag was. The child adjusted his grip and held it closer, the red circle resting lightly against his chest. He didn't know the histories behind the flag, but he knew this was something that could not be dropped.This is how most of us learn to love a country, without explanation, without context. We learn the colours first. Long before we learn the dates or names, we learn the feeling of belonging. And the weight of it in our hands.For those who were born long after 1971, the Liberation War doesn't live in our memory. It lives in pieces. On a road named after someone we never met. In a story that stops just before the pain becomes too difficult to explain. We neither earned nor experienced victory. We simply inherited it. And inheritance is easy to take for granted.The trouble is, victory isn't a resting place. It's a starting line. It asks something of us, every day, to carry it forward, not just in parades, but in principle. To remember that freedom wasn't won just once. It's kept, or it's lost, in the small choices of ordinary life. Independence didn't end the work. It passed it on. To us.What happened in 1971 was never just a war ending. It was a world breaking open. It was the moment when ordinary people decided that language, name, and the right to walk through one's own home without fear were worth more than silence. Worth more than safety. They chose, when choosing felt impossible. And that choice built this country. Decades later, a different child stands on a peaceful street. He points to a flag on a stick, wanting it not as a tool of survival, but as a token of belonging. His wanting is a luxury they bought for him, at a price they never meant him to understand.The trouble is, victory isn't a resting place. It's a starting line. It asks something of us, every day, to carry it forward, not just in parades, but in principle. To remember that freedom wasn't won just once. It's kept, or it's lost, in the small choices of ordinary life. Independence didn't end the work. It passed it on. To us.As the distance from 1971 grows, the struggle becomes visible only as victory. But victory risks being reduced to dates and ceremonial pride. It becomes something we display rather than something we think about. We forget that this country wasn't handed down gently. There's a grief folded into our victory that no celebration can undo. Freedom did not bring the dead back to their homes and nor did it erase the pain that survivors carried. Many people built the country quietly while carrying loss that was never acknowledged publicly. Remembering this is not an act of sadness, it is an act of honesty. Perhaps Victory Day should unsettle us a little.File Photo: Sazzad Ibne SayedIt should remind us that the freedom we enjoy was not free, and that forgetting the difficulty of achieving it makes us careless with its meaning. The father's whisper, careful, was not only for the child. It was a reminder for all of us.When he learns about mass graves, silenced voices and broken families, may he find a country that still respects the sacrifices that made it possible.

Red-green flag and the comfort of forgetting independenceWisdomWisdomBySinthia KamalWed Dec 24, 2025 12:10 PMLast update on: Wed Dec 24, 2025 02:33 PMOn a street I had passed countless times, I noticed a child holding something small that seemed to carry the weight of the world, as I kept walking quietly. A father paused at a footpath stall while his son stood beside him, restless and close to tears. The stall was filled with plastic horns, balloons, whistles, but the child kept pointing at the same thing. Among the bright, forgettable objects, a small green and red flag, hung on a thick bamboo stick. As his father placed the flag in his hand, he leaned down and whispered, \"Careful.\" The word felt heavier than the flag was. The child adjusted his grip and held it closer, the red circle resting lightly against his chest. He didn't know the histories behind the flag, but he knew this was something that could not be dropped.This is how most of us learn to love a country, without explanation, without context. We learn the colours first. Long before we learn the dates or names, we learn the feeling of belonging. And the weight of it in our hands.For those who were born long after 1971, the Liberation War doesn't live in our memory. It lives in pieces. On a road named after someone we never met. In a story that stops just before the pain becomes too difficult to explain. We neither earned nor experienced victory. We simply inherited it. And inheritance is easy to take for granted.The trouble is, victory isn't a resting place. It's a starting line. It asks something of us, every day, to carry it forward, not just in parades, but in principle. To remember that freedom wasn't won just once. It's kept, or it's lost, in the small choices of ordinary life. Independence didn't end the work. It passed it on. To us.What happened in 1971 was never just a war ending. It was a world breaking open. It was the moment when ordinary people decided that language, name, and the right to walk through one's own home without fear were worth more than silence. Worth more than safety. They chose, when choosing felt impossible. And that choice built this country. Decades later, a different child stands on a peaceful street. He points to a flag on a stick, wanting it not as a tool of survival, but as a token of belonging.

One of them would sing out, \"Token number so-and-so\", and the other would come forward to get poked with an injection. I don't know if it was the sing-song tone or the imaginary shot that made them all giggly, but they seemed very proud of the game they had invented.Both of them had faced genuine health scares earlier this year.One survived dengue, the other chikungunya.They went through repeated blood tests and visits to \"real\" doctors and \"real\" diagnostic centers; nightmares for us parents.These moments were especially difficult when you consider the impact of the dengue outbreak this year.In 2025 alone, Bangladesh witnessed 409 deaths so far, while the disease inflicted 110,765 people (Source:Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha). We were lucky that we were not part of that death toll.Luck— you need a lot of it to stay alive in this city. And also a sense of dark humour.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life. So what do you call Dhaka? For me, no more ajadur shohor. Some call it a deathtrap, some call it Gotham with no Batman to save. Some compare it to living inside a video game and some: an unreleased installment of Final Destination.I have noticed that many people in Bangladesh have found ways to cope with death and disasters through dark humour. It does not mean they lack sensitivity or empathy, in fact quite the opposite.  Humour is just a survival mechanism, a way of acknowledging death while continuing to live without being consumed by it. When you hear people joke about what could have happened in the recent spates of earthquakes, for example, you realise that you're living in a city that has adopted humour as a way to cope with the many challenges thrown their way.Humour is the superpower you unlock when the world around you conspires to kill you at any moment.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life.So what do you call Dhaka? For me, no more ajadur shohor. Some call it a deathtrap, some call it Gotham with no Batman to save. Some compare it to living inside a video game and some: an unreleased installment of Final Destination.And can you blame us? Abul Kalam died when a bearing pad fell on him. The body of Faria Tasnim Jyoti was recovered 36 hours after she fell into an uncovered drain in Tongi, Gazipur. If you think you are safe at home, remember the recent murder of the mother and daughter in their own residence.If you are a minority, the chances are higher.If you are a woman, the chances are higher.If you are a child, the chances are higher.If you are someone trying to raise your voice, making a difference, or politically active the chances are higher.And as if all this is not enough, there is the earthquake scare and other natural disasters. There is also fear of mobs. This year we have seen death come in many forms. At times the number felt unreal, at others the reasons did.  Some were violent and loudly discussed, some were silent, unreported. Many of these deaths rearranged something inside us until the city started to feel like a house of cards, even as we kept going.Aerial view of Dhaka. File Photo: Nakib Shah AlamDeath next door: Milestone tragedySome incidents are so absurd, so Kafkaesque, that the mind refuses to accept them at first.On July 20, 2025, Bangladesh lived through one of its most horrific chapters when a training aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force crashed into a building of the Milestone School and College in Uttara Dhaka.My office and home are both in Uttara.  That morning, I took my sick cat to the vet and went to the office after dropping her home.It was around 1:30 pm when a colleague called to say that a plane had crashed into Milestone School. Uttara has many branches of Milestone. I had just crossed one myself. It sounded like an extreme exaggeration, until it wasn't.For the rest of the day, we helplessly watched school children— who were supposed to be returning home in a few minutes—screaming in agony as they burned to death.It was a regular workday. Our office is very close to Diabari, where the accident took place. We carried on like zombies with the sound of ambulances, fire brigades and crowds in the background.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Some people I know send their children to Milestone. You see Milestone students everywhere in Uttara— in elevators, on street corners, at local stationery shops. I don't know if it is the proximity of the school to our home, or the fact that I have a child of similar age to the victims, so many children had such a tragic death inside their second home; it felt as though the distance between death and me was nonexistent.If you are Bangladeshi, death can feel routine. The Milestone school incident felt personal. I feel like I know Nazia, Nafee, Shayan, Mahreen Miss, Shobuja Khala.Death is sitting right next to us.The next day, life continued with cruel precision— morning tea, getting ready for work.I had to take Monu, my eight-year-old cat, to the vet again for her treatment.I myself had a doctor's appointment for an old pain. After dropping Monu home, I went to the hospital planning to go to work afterward. Then my phone rang.Monu, my cat was not moving. She died.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Somewhere between the Milestone fire and my cat's death, something inside me broke open. My knees gave way. I sat down and cried in the hospital— not quietly, but profusely, uncontrollably—for Monu, for the Milestone children I would never meet. Only then did I realise how much grief I had been carrying.That day, I also learnt one more thing— hospitals are a great place to cry. No one questions you or judges you. You feel no obligation to explain.While they (the shadharon jonota) are simply trying to navigate their life amid death and unknown, uncertain dangers, I feel that everyone in this city holds unreleased grief within them. And if we want to actually get going with life, somewhere along the way we need to hear the grief's demands to be released. We need to scream and cry it out.It's been five months since that incident; I often wonder how the families are doing. So much has happened ever since, some more fire incidents, many more deaths.In the days following the tragedy, on my way back home from dropping my daughter off to school, I would often spot \"We mourn for Milestone\" banners throughout different sectors of Uttara. Then one day, they were taken down. Just like that, we move on to the next big incident.There was a press conference where the parents recounted the suffering and tragedy of the \"fortunate\" children who survived and those who couldn't. They spoke about how difficult it is for them to live the trauma, how hard it will be for the survivors to even hold a pen or to look at an airplane. They spoke about how that one seemingly regular day of their life altered their daily reality forever, how they struggled with purpose and to navigate a life. How ironic it is that they have to demand the best treatment for their little fighters; that it's not a given by the State.A student of Milestone School and College holds her teacher as she cries while recounting the horrors of the previous day when a fighter jet crashed into one of the school buildings. File Photo: Prabir DasWe see them, empathise with them on some level, and understand them from a distance, but we will never be able to truly comprehend the pain that the families live with everyday. As we are saying goodbye to this year, I keep praying for these little victims and their families.The Milestones incident did not alter my daily reality the way it did for the victims' families. But this sense of unreality made me more grounded, more compassionate, and more aware of the perpetual proximity of death's closeness.That getting back home to our family is the whole point of the day.The famous song 'dhonodhanne pushpebhora'is of course close to our heart but after every unusual, absurd accident- every avoidable death and failure of accountability the line'emon deshti kothao khuje pabe nako tumi'resurfaces our newsfeed as status and memes reflecting our lived irony. See, humour is a survival skill for us.It does not mean we lack patriotism, in fact quite the opposite.You have to love this city to live in it, to wake up every morning and step into its chaos.So what do you call this city? I call it home.And you have to carry some luck and some love—stubborn, foolish love— in your heart to call such a difficult place your home.Fayeka Zabeen Siddiquais the co-founder and designer of Shishu Poribohon and mother of seven cats.Send your articles forSlow Readsto[email protected].

I don't know if it was the sing-song tone or the imaginary shot that made them all giggly, but they seemed very proud of the game they had invented.Both of them had faced genuine health scares earlier this year.One survived dengue, the other chikungunya.They went through repeated blood tests and visits to \"real\" doctors and \"real\" diagnostic centers; nightmares for us parents.These moments were especially difficult when you consider the impact of the dengue outbreak this year.In 2025 alone, Bangladesh witnessed 409 deaths so far, while the disease inflicted 110,765 people (Source:Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha). We were lucky that we were not part of that death toll.Luck— you need a lot of it to stay alive in this city. And also a sense of dark humour.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life. So what do you call Dhaka? For me, no more ajadur shohor. Some call it a deathtrap, some call it Gotham with no Batman to save. Some compare it to living inside a video game and some: an unreleased installment of Final Destination.I have noticed that many people in Bangladesh have found ways to cope with death and disasters through dark humour. It does not mean they lack sensitivity or empathy, in fact quite the opposite.  Humour is just a survival mechanism, a way of acknowledging death while continuing to live without being consumed by it. When you hear people joke about what could have happened in the recent spates of earthquakes, for example, you realise that you're living in a city that has adopted humour as a way to cope with the many challenges thrown their way.Humour is the superpower you unlock when the world around you conspires to kill you at any moment.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life.So what do you call Dhaka?

The body of Faria Tasnim Jyoti was recovered 36 hours after she fell into an uncovered drain in Tongi, Gazipur.

There is also fear of mobs. This year we have seen death come in many forms. At times the number felt unreal, at others the reasons did.  Some were violent and loudly discussed, some were silent, unreported. Many of these deaths rearranged something inside us until the city started to feel like a house of cards, even as we kept going.Aerial view of Dhaka. File Photo: Nakib Shah AlamDeath next door: Milestone tragedySome incidents are so absurd, so Kafkaesque, that the mind refuses to accept them at first.On July 20, 2025, Bangladesh lived through one of its most horrific chapters when a training aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force crashed into a building of the Milestone School and College in Uttara Dhaka.My office and home are both in Uttara.  That morning, I took my sick cat to the vet and went to the office after dropping her home.It was around 1:30 pm when a colleague called to say that a plane had crashed into Milestone School. Uttara has many branches of Milestone. I had just crossed one myself. It sounded like an extreme exaggeration, until it wasn't.For the rest of the day, we helplessly watched school children— who were supposed to be returning home in a few minutes—screaming in agony as they burned to death.It was a regular workday. Our office is very close to Diabari, where the accident took place. We carried on like zombies with the sound of ambulances, fire brigades and crowds in the background.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Some people I know send their children to Milestone. You see Milestone students everywhere in Uttara— in elevators, on street corners, at local stationery shops. I don't know if it is the proximity of the school to our home, or the fact that I have a child of similar age to the victims, so many children had such a tragic death inside their second home; it felt as though the distance between death and me was nonexistent.If you are Bangladeshi, death can feel routine. The Milestone school incident felt personal. I feel like I know Nazia, Nafee, Shayan, Mahreen Miss, Shobuja Khala.Death is sitting right next to us.The next day, life continued with cruel precision— morning tea, getting ready for work.I had to take Monu, my eight-year-old cat, to the vet again for her treatment.I myself had a doctor's appointment for an old pain. After dropping Monu home, I went to the hospital planning to go to work afterward. Then my phone rang.Monu, my cat was not moving. She died.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Somewhere between the Milestone fire and my cat's death, something inside me broke open. My knees gave way. I sat down and cried in the hospital— not quietly, but profusely, uncontrollably—for Monu, for the Milestone children I would never meet. Only then did I realise how much grief I had been carrying.That day, I also learnt one more thing— hospitals are a great place to cry. No one questions you or judges you. You feel no obligation to explain.While they (the shadharon jonota) are simply trying to navigate their life amid death and unknown, uncertain dangers, I feel that everyone in this city holds unreleased grief within them. And if we want to actually get going with life, somewhere along the way we need to hear the grief's demands to be released. We need to scream and cry it out.It's been five months since that incident; I often wonder how the families are doing. So much has happened ever since, some more fire incidents, many more deaths.In the days following the tragedy, on my way back home from dropping my daughter off to school, I would often spot \"We mourn for Milestone\" banners throughout different sectors of Uttara. Then one day, they were taken down. Just like that, we move on to the next big incident.There was a press conference where the parents recounted the suffering and tragedy of the \"fortunate\" children who survived and those who couldn't. They spoke about how difficult it is for them to live the trauma, how hard it will be for the survivors to even hold a pen or to look at an airplane. They spoke about how that one seemingly regular day of their life altered their daily reality forever, how they struggled with purpose and to navigate a life. How ironic it is that they have to demand the best treatment for their little fighters; that it's not a given by the State.A student of Milestone School and College holds her teacher as she cries while recounting the horrors of the previous day when a fighter jet crashed into one of the school buildings. File Photo: Prabir DasWe see them, empathise with them on some level, and understand them from a distance, but we will never be able to truly comprehend the pain that the families live with everyday. As we are saying goodbye to this year, I keep praying for these little victims and their families.The Milestones incident did not alter my daily reality the way it did for the victims' families. But this sense of unreality made me more grounded, more compassionate, and more aware of the perpetual proximity of death's closeness.That getting back home to our family is the whole point of the day.The famous song 'dhonodhanne pushpebhora'is of course close to our heart but after every unusual, absurd accident- every avoidable death and failure of accountability the line'emon deshti kothao khuje pabe nako tumi'resurfaces our newsfeed as status and memes reflecting our lived irony. See, humour is a survival skill for us.It does not mean we lack patriotism, in fact quite the opposite.You have to love this city to live in it, to wake up every morning and step into its chaos.So what do you call this city? I call it home.And you have to carry some luck and some love—stubborn, foolish love— in your heart to call such a difficult place your home.Fayeka Zabeen Siddiquais the co-founder and designer of Shishu Poribohon and mother of seven cats.Send your articles forSlow Readsto[email protected].

I don't know if it is the proximity of the school to our home, or the fact that I have a child of similar age to the victims, so many children had such a tragic death inside their second home; it felt as though the distance between death and me was nonexistent.If you are Bangladeshi, death can feel routine. The Milestone school incident felt personal. I feel like I know Nazia, Nafee, Shayan, Mahreen Miss, Shobuja Khala.Death is sitting right next to us.The next day, life continued with cruel precision— morning tea, getting ready for work.I had to take Monu, my eight-year-old cat, to the vet again for her treatment.I myself had a doctor's appointment for an old pain. After dropping Monu home, I went to the hospital planning to go to work afterward. Then my phone rang.Monu, my cat was not moving. She died.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Somewhere between the Milestone fire and my cat's death, something inside me broke open. My knees gave way. I sat down and cried in the hospital— not quietly, but profusely, uncontrollably—for Monu, for the Milestone children I would never meet. Only then did I realise how much grief I had been carrying.That day, I also learnt one more thing— hospitals are a great place to cry. No one questions you or judges you. You feel no obligation to explain.While they (the shadharon jonota) are simply trying to navigate their life amid death and unknown, uncertain dangers, I feel that everyone in this city holds unreleased grief within them. And if we want to actually get going with life, somewhere along the way we need to hear the grief's demands to be released. We need to scream and cry it out.It's been five months since that incident; I often wonder how the families are doing. So much has happened ever since, some more fire incidents, many more deaths.In the days following the tragedy, on my way back home from dropping my daughter off to school, I would often spot \"We mourn for Milestone\" banners throughout different sectors of Uttara. Then one day, they were taken down. Just like that, we move on to the next big incident.There was a press conference where the parents recounted the suffering and tragedy of the \"fortunate\" children who survived and those who couldn't. They spoke about how difficult it is for them to live the trauma, how hard it will be for the survivors to even hold a pen or to look at an airplane. They spoke about how that one seemingly regular day of their life altered their daily reality forever, how they struggled with purpose and to navigate a life. How ironic it is that they have to demand the best treatment for their little fighters; that it's not a given by the State.A student of Milestone School and College holds her teacher as she cries while recounting the horrors of the previous day when a fighter jet crashed into one of the school buildings. File Photo: Prabir DasWe see them, empathise with them on some level, and understand them from a distance, but we will never be able to truly comprehend the pain that the families live with everyday. As we are saying goodbye to this year, I keep praying for these little victims and their families.The Milestones incident did not alter my daily reality the way it did for the victims' families. But this sense of unreality made me more grounded, more compassionate, and more aware of the perpetual proximity of death's closeness.That getting back home to our family is the whole point of the day.The famous song 'dhonodhanne pushpebhora'is of course close to our heart but after every unusual, absurd accident- every avoidable death and failure of accountability the line'emon deshti kothao khuje pabe nako tumi'resurfaces our newsfeed as status and memes reflecting our lived irony.

One of them would sing out, \"Token number so-and-so\", and the other would come forward to get poked with an injection. I don't know if it was the sing-song tone or the imaginary shot that made them all giggly, but they seemed very proud of the game they had invented.Both of them had faced genuine health scares earlier this year.One survived dengue, the other chikungunya.They went through repeated blood tests and visits to \"real\" doctors and \"real\" diagnostic centers; nightmares for us parents.These moments were especially difficult when you consider the impact of the dengue outbreak this year.In 2025 alone, Bangladesh witnessed 409 deaths so far, while the disease inflicted 110,765 people (Source:Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha). We were lucky that we were not part of that death toll.Luck— you need a lot of it to stay alive in this city. And also a sense of dark humour.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life. So what do you call Dhaka? For me, no more ajadur shohor. Some call it a deathtrap, some call it Gotham with no Batman to save. Some compare it to living inside a video game and some: an unreleased installment of Final Destination.I have noticed that many people in Bangladesh have found ways to cope with death and disasters through dark humour. It does not mean they lack sensitivity or empathy, in fact quite the opposite.  Humour is just a survival mechanism, a way of acknowledging death while continuing to live without being consumed by it. When you hear people joke about what could have happened in the recent spates of earthquakes, for example, you realise that you're living in a city that has adopted humour as a way to cope with the many challenges thrown their way.Humour is the superpower you unlock when the world around you conspires to kill you at any moment.If you live in Dhaka, it takes a reckless kind of courage, and a quiet delusion to dodge death, reach home, enjoy your morning tea and go about your life.So what do you call Dhaka? For me, no more ajadur shohor. Some call it a deathtrap, some call it Gotham with no Batman to save. Some compare it to living inside a video game and some: an unreleased installment of Final Destination.And can you blame us? Abul Kalam died when a bearing pad fell on him. The body of Faria Tasnim Jyoti was recovered 36 hours after she fell into an uncovered drain in Tongi, Gazipur. If you think you are safe at home, remember the recent murder of the mother and daughter in their own residence.If you are a minority, the chances are higher.If you are a woman, the chances are higher.If you are a child, the chances are higher.If you are someone trying to raise your voice, making a difference, or politically active the chances are higher.And as if all this is not enough, there is the earthquake scare and other natural disasters. There is also fear of mobs. This year we have seen death come in many forms. At times the number felt unreal, at others the reasons did.  Some were violent and loudly discussed, some were silent, unreported. Many of these deaths rearranged something inside us until the city started to feel like a house of cards, even as we kept going.Aerial view of Dhaka. File Photo: Nakib Shah AlamDeath next door: Milestone tragedySome incidents are so absurd, so Kafkaesque, that the mind refuses to accept them at first.On July 20, 2025, Bangladesh lived through one of its most horrific chapters when a training aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force crashed into a building of the Milestone School and College in Uttara Dhaka.My office and home are both in Uttara.  That morning, I took my sick cat to the vet and went to the office after dropping her home.It was around 1:30 pm when a colleague called to say that a plane had crashed into Milestone School. Uttara has many branches of Milestone. I had just crossed one myself. It sounded like an extreme exaggeration, until it wasn't.For the rest of the day, we helplessly watched school children— who were supposed to be returning home in a few minutes—screaming in agony as they burned to death.It was a regular workday. Our office is very close to Diabari, where the accident took place. We carried on like zombies with the sound of ambulances, fire brigades and crowds in the background.When I returned home that evening, my heart felt heavy with grief, anger, and compassion I didn't know how to process. I stayed up all night, scrolling for updates of those babies while holding my own school-going child to my heart. I felt lucky that my baby was still alive, and then almost immediately felt guilty for feeling any kind of luck.Some people I know send their children to Milestone.

The mother of these street puppies was not around when this \"inhuman\" act took place. When she returned, she was not only visibly distressed and disoriented, but also in physical pain, her body heavy with unweaned milk—a visual display of this agony is circulating on social media.This human-made tragedy, however, was partially remedied by \"humans\" themselves. A young man brought two newborn puppies from his own pet dog and gently introduced them to the grieving mother. He let her milk soak the puppies' fur so that they would not smell unfamiliar, then placed them beside her. After some hesitation, she accepted them. The next day, by coincidence, a dog in a neighbouring district died, leaving behind two puppies. They, too, were brought to the mourning mother. With this second adoption, her family, in some fragile way, was restored.Beyond the immediate question of what counts as \"human\" or \"inhuman\", this story opens onto themes that we get to know little of. It was later learned that the housewife—whose act of clandestine violence was testified to by her own young son—had acted on the advice of a beggar who walked that neighbourhood daily. For a mobile street beggar, a lane free of dogs is a territorial issue: fewer animals to compete with for scraps, fewer sudden threats on the road. That territorial anxiety is rooted in a chronic scarcity, for both men and dogs, that ebbs and flows with the seasons.A street dog mourns beside the bodies of her drowned puppies in Ishwardi, Bangladesh—an image that sparked outrage. Photo: Collected.November—or Agrahayan, in the Bengali calendar—is the time when paddy is harvested; there is relatively more food, a bit of spare cash, a little more abundance, and a little more waste. Street dogs with new litters and itinerant beggars seeking extra leftovers are both responding, in different ways, to this seasonal opening.So the headline that ignites public outrage—\"Cruel housewife kills eight puppies\"—is really just the tip of a long, submerged pyramid of stories. Beneath it are cascading layers that draw us into the tangled realities of human and more-than-human lives, all sharing the same streets, seasons, and scarcities.How, then, do we locate this story within the emerging field of environmental humanities? It clearly illuminates interspecies relations and care, the psychology of fear and scarcity, questions of animal welfare, and the silences or ad hoc reactions of local governance. But it also exposes the epistemic boundaries of the discipline itself. Like many powerful ideas of the last few centuries, environmental history and environmental humanities were incubated primarily in the Global North. It is encouraging that institutions and scholars in the Global South—from South Asia to Latin America and Africa—are now entering these conversations. Yet the epistemic gap remains: how much does the Global North really know, or want to know, about the everyday ecological and ethical worlds of the Global South?FILE PHOTO: Toukir Ahmed TanveeThat gap is not just about knowledge; it is built into the material conditions that shape the vulnerability of non-human species and the historical construction of global spatial inequality. If environmental humanities is serious about interspecies ethics, it has to remain open to questions of inequality, poverty, and precarity, especially under climate change, which adds new territorial and existential contests that see a slow erosion of empathy across species lines. This emerges from a situation in which humans—good, bad, and the nonchalant—are left with limited choices for being and becoming in relation to nature.Late-twentieth-century environmental history in the United States, where the discipline took shape, was criticised for sometimes reflecting a largely middle-class conservation sensibility. One hopes that environmental humanities, with its enormous critical potential, will avoid a similar censure.

When she returned, she was not only visibly distressed and disoriented, but also in physical pain, her body heavy with unweaned milk—a visual display of this agony is circulating on social media.This human-made tragedy, however, was partially remedied by \"humans\" themselves. A young man brought two newborn puppies from his own pet dog and gently introduced them to the grieving mother. He let her milk soak the puppies' fur so that they would not smell unfamiliar, then placed them beside her. After some hesitation, she accepted them. The next day, by coincidence, a dog in a neighbouring district died, leaving behind two puppies. They, too, were brought to the mourning mother. With this second adoption, her family, in some fragile way, was restored.Beyond the immediate question of what counts as \"human\" or \"inhuman\", this story opens onto themes that we get to know little of. It was later learned that the housewife—whose act of clandestine violence was testified to by her own young son—had acted on the advice of a beggar who walked that neighbourhood daily. For a mobile street beggar, a lane free of dogs is a territorial issue: fewer animals to compete with for scraps, fewer sudden threats on the road. That territorial anxiety is rooted in a chronic scarcity, for both men and dogs, that ebbs and flows with the seasons.A street dog mourns beside the bodies of her drowned puppies in Ishwardi, Bangladesh—an image that sparked outrage.

It also exposes a landscape shaped by years of unchecked groundwater extraction, where dry shafts lie open and danger has become routine. In the Barind region, what was once a seasonal scarcity of water is now hardening into a permanent crisis.The Barind region sits on the northwestern part of Bangladesh, stretching across Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogura, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Pabna, and Rajshahi. It is simultaneously one of the hottest regions during summer and one of the coldest during winter. For decades, the area has been marked as one of South Asia's major drought-prone zones. Now, the warnings feel less like projections and more like an imminent reality.Most rivers, canals, and wetlands in Barind dry up during the winter. Shallow pumps that once served farmers are no longer able to reach the receding water table. Deep tube wells have taken their place. This shift comes at a cost: farmers must use more electricity to lift water from deeper layers, and constant pumping gives aquifers no time to recover.\"Over-extraction is the main problem,\" said Professor Dr Khondokar Emamul Haque of Rajshahi University's Geology and Mining Department. \"In the Barind belts, the surface water level is already insufficient, so people are forced to extract groundwater for both irrigation and drinking. Because of this constant pressure, the aquifer doesn't get enough time to recharge properly.\"\"Unlike other floodplain areas, Barind is an elevated plain, and because of this it can't form land reclamation. The grains and finer particles that help recharge aquifers aren't available here. We can't even call it grain; we call it Barind clay. The deposition is not good at all, so natural recharge remains low year after year,\" shared Dr Haque.A deep tube well in the low-lying area of Uchadanga in Rajshahi’s Tanore upazila, where large stretches of farmland develop cracks during the dry season. File photo: StarWhen pumping exceeds the rate at which aquifers can replenish, the soil loses support below ground and begins to sink. Haque warned that \"overuse of deep tube wells in these regions can result in land subsidence,\" a slow sinking of land that can damage roads and homes and make future water storage even more difficult.Jahid Hossain, Principal Scientific Officer at WARPO (Water Resources Planning Organisation), described it as a combination of overuse and rainfall deficit. \"If you look at the average rainfall of Bangladesh and compare it to these areas, you will see it is naturally much lower. The aquifer volume is comparatively low too. These areas are renowned for paddy cultivation, and farmers are naturally dependent on groundwater because rainfall is low and surface water isn't sufficient.\"\"We are planning to launch an irrigation development project,\" said Arifur Rahman Ankur, Executive Engineer of the Rajshahi Water Development Division, BWDB. The idea is simple: bring water from the Padma River and distribute it to fields in Tanore, Poba, and other pockets of the region. \"We had several studies done, but none of them led to an actual project.\"Ankur said the main challenge is that rivers and canals, which used to carry water into Barind's plains, are themselves drying up. Without flowing canals, farmers fall back on tube wells again. The cycle repeats.He sees two key alternatives. \"First, we need to reinvigorate the rivers in those Barind areas. Then the canals will have enough water so farmers can use them during the dry season. That will also help recharge groundwater. And we need to promote rainwater harvesting projects. During the monsoon, we must conserve water for the dry season.\"Farmers speak from lived experience, and their stories reveal the uneven spread of crisis across the region. Nur Islam, a farmer from Dinajpur Sadar, grows potatoes, paddy, eggplants, and tomatoes. His community has been struggling for the past three to four years; neighbouring districts, he said, for nearly a decade. \"After the month of Magh, the rivers dry up, leaving no water for irrigation.\" He relies on both shallow pumps and deep tube wells. He manages occasionally, but more often he cannot.Others feel less pressure, though the warning signs are already visible. Md Milon Islam, an onion farmer from Birol, said the problem remains an inconvenience for now. \"Sometimes water doesn't come up during the day, so we have to wait until night.\" He views the abundance of deep tube wells in his area as a buffer for the coming years. Yet the fact that water rises only at night signals that the local aquifer is slipping beyond the reach of daytime pumping.In Vatina village, Zillur grows potatoes, bananas, and paddy. Winter is especially difficult. \"Water doesn't come without a submersible pump,\" he said. He also worries about the shortage of affordable shallow machines and rising input costs. His frustrations extend to what he sees as a lack of government attention. \"Right after winter, we face a water crisis, and the signs are already there,\" he added.The experiences differ from village to village, but the trend is clear: dry seasons are arriving earlier, staying longer, and demanding more groundwater than the land can comfortably give.The Groundwater Foundation, a US-based non-profit organisation working on groundwater conservation and education, outlines a grim set of consequences if over-extraction continues: reduced surface water, permanent loss of aquifer storage, land subsidence, and declining water quality. In some parts of the world, subsidence has sunk land by metres. Barind could face similar risks if the soil continues to give way.A 2025 study published in the journal Global Food Security, titled \"Revisiting the Drought–Food Insecurity Nexus: A Social–Ecological Systems Perspective\", warned that if climate pressures persist and water management continues to lag, food security in northwestern Bangladesh could decline by more than half. Barind's farmers already bear higher costs for water, diesel, and fertiliser. A falling aquifer adds yet another layer of risk to their livelihoods.The solutions proposed by scientists and engineers point in a common direction: reducing dependence on groundwater and restoring the surface water network. Professor Haque echoed this view, stressing that deep tube wells should be reserved for drinking water, not irrigation. \"Surface water use needs to increase. Reviving canals is essential,\" he said. He pointed to examples in Godagari, where farmers pump water directly from the Padma for irrigation, and to parts of Satkhira, where rainwater harvesting has become a routine practice.Onlookers watch from the embankment as rescue workers and an excavator operate deep within a pit on December 11, 2025. The 32-hour mission came to a heartbreaking end when the body of two-year-old Sajid was recovered from the abandoned shaft. Photo: Azahar UddinYet each of these options demands sustained investment, political commitment, and patient engagement with farmers. WARPO, the government's Water Resources Planning Organisation, itself struggles with manpower shortages, while the agencies responsible for implementation often fall short in terms of funding and coordination.Still, the path forward is clear. Aquifers need time—around 90 days of rest to recharge, according to Professor Haque. Canals require dredging and regular maintenance. Rainwater must be stored. Crop choices need to adapt to the region's changing climate.Like clockwork, the Barind water crisis returns to the headlines each dry season, when the damage becomes visible enough to demand attention. Yet meaningful precaution rarely follows. One year, shallow pumps begin to fail; the next, deep tube wells require ever more powerful motors. Rivers shrink. Canals narrow. Farmers wait until night to draw water. What was once a seasonal hardship is steadily hardening into a permanent condition.The region now stands at a crossroads, where the choices made today will determine whether Barind remains a productive agricultural heartland or slips into a future marked by chronic water stress.Ystiaque Ahmedis a journalist at The Daily Star.

It also exposes a landscape shaped by years of unchecked groundwater extraction, where dry shafts lie open and danger has become routine. In the Barind region, what was once a seasonal scarcity of water is now hardening into a permanent crisis.The Barind region sits on the northwestern part of Bangladesh, stretching across Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogura, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Pabna, and Rajshahi. It is simultaneously one of the hottest regions during summer and one of the coldest during winter. For decades, the area has been marked as one of South Asia's major drought-prone zones. Now, the warnings feel less like projections and more like an imminent reality.Most rivers, canals, and wetlands in Barind dry up during the winter. Shallow pumps that once served farmers are no longer able to reach the receding water table. Deep tube wells have taken their place. This shift comes at a cost: farmers must use more electricity to lift water from deeper layers, and constant pumping gives aquifers no time to recover.\"Over-extraction is the main problem,\" said Professor Dr Khondokar Emamul Haque of Rajshahi University's Geology and Mining Department. \"In the Barind belts, the surface water level is already insufficient, so people are forced to extract groundwater for both irrigation and drinking. Because of this constant pressure, the aquifer doesn't get enough time to recharge properly.\"\"Unlike other floodplain areas, Barind is an elevated plain, and because of this it can't form land reclamation. The grains and finer particles that help recharge aquifers aren't available here. We can't even call it grain; we call it Barind clay. The deposition is not good at all, so natural recharge remains low year after year,\" shared Dr Haque.A deep tube well in the low-lying area of Uchadanga in Rajshahi’s Tanore upazila, where large stretches of farmland develop cracks during the dry season. File photo: StarWhen pumping exceeds the rate at which aquifers can replenish, the soil loses support below ground and begins to sink. Haque warned that \"overuse of deep tube wells in these regions can result in land subsidence,\" a slow sinking of land that can damage roads and homes and make future water storage even more difficult.Jahid Hossain, Principal Scientific Officer at WARPO (Water Resources Planning Organisation), described it as a combination of overuse and rainfall deficit. \"If you look at the average rainfall of Bangladesh and compare it to these areas, you will see it is naturally much lower. The aquifer volume is comparatively low too. These areas are renowned for paddy cultivation, and farmers are naturally dependent on groundwater because rainfall is low and surface water isn't sufficient.\"\"We are planning to launch an irrigation development project,\" said Arifur Rahman Ankur, Executive Engineer of the Rajshahi Water Development Division, BWDB. The idea is simple: bring water from the Padma River and distribute it to fields in Tanore, Poba, and other pockets of the region. \"We had several studies done, but none of them led to an actual project.\"Ankur said the main challenge is that rivers and canals, which used to carry water into Barind's plains, are themselves drying up. Without flowing canals, farmers fall back on tube wells again. The cycle repeats.He sees two key alternatives. \"First, we need to reinvigorate the rivers in those Barind areas. Then the canals will have enough water so farmers can use them during the dry season. That will also help recharge groundwater. And we need to promote rainwater harvesting projects. During the monsoon, we must conserve water for the dry season.\"Farmers speak from lived experience, and their stories reveal the uneven spread of crisis across the region. Nur Islam, a farmer from Dinajpur Sadar, grows potatoes, paddy, eggplants, and tomatoes. His community has been struggling for the past three to four years; neighbouring districts, he said, for nearly a decade. \"After the month of Magh, the rivers dry up, leaving no water for irrigation.\" He relies on both shallow pumps and deep tube wells. He manages occasionally, but more often he cannot.Others feel less pressure, though the warning signs are already visible. Md Milon Islam, an onion farmer from Birol, said the problem remains an inconvenience for now. \"Sometimes water doesn't come up during the day, so we have to wait until night.\" He views the abundance of deep tube wells in his area as a buffer for the coming years. Yet the fact that water rises only at night signals that the local aquifer is slipping beyond the reach of daytime pumping.In Vatina village, Zillur grows potatoes, bananas, and paddy. Winter is especially difficult. \"Water doesn't come without a submersible pump,\" he said. He also worries about the shortage of affordable shallow machines and rising input costs. His frustrations extend to what he sees as a lack of government attention. \"Right after winter, we face a water crisis, and the signs are already there,\" he added.The experiences differ from village to village, but the trend is clear: dry seasons are arriving earlier, staying longer, and demanding more groundwater than the land can comfortably give.The Groundwater Foundation, a US-based non-profit organisation working on groundwater conservation and education, outlines a grim set of consequences if over-extraction continues: reduced surface water, permanent loss of aquifer storage, land subsidence, and declining water quality. In some parts of the world, subsidence has sunk land by metres. Barind could face similar risks if the soil continues to give way.A 2025 study published in the journal Global Food Security, titled \"Revisiting the Drought–Food Insecurity Nexus: A Social–Ecological Systems Perspective\", warned that if climate pressures persist and water management continues to lag, food security in northwestern Bangladesh could decline by more than half. Barind's farmers already bear higher costs for water, diesel, and fertiliser. A falling aquifer adds yet another layer of risk to their livelihoods.The solutions proposed by scientists and engineers point in a common direction: reducing dependence on groundwater and restoring the surface water network. Professor Haque echoed this view, stressing that deep tube wells should be reserved for drinking water, not irrigation. \"Surface water use needs to increase. Reviving canals is essential,\" he said. He pointed to examples in Godagari, where farmers pump water directly from the Padma for irrigation, and to parts of Satkhira, where rainwater harvesting has become a routine practice.Onlookers watch from the embankment as rescue workers and an excavator operate deep within a pit on December 11, 2025. The 32-hour mission came to a heartbreaking end when the body of two-year-old Sajid was recovered from the abandoned shaft. Photo: Azahar UddinYet each of these options demands sustained investment, political commitment, and patient engagement with farmers. WARPO, the government's Water Resources Planning Organisation, itself struggles with manpower shortages, while the agencies responsible for implementation often fall short in terms of funding and coordination.Still, the path forward is clear. Aquifers need time—around 90 days of rest to recharge, according to Professor Haque. Canals require dredging and regular maintenance. Rainwater must be stored. Crop choices need to adapt to the region's changing climate.Like clockwork, the Barind water crisis returns to the headlines each dry season, when the damage becomes visible enough to demand attention. Yet meaningful precaution rarely follows. One year, shallow pumps begin to fail; the next, deep tube wells require ever more powerful motors. Rivers shrink. Canals narrow. Farmers wait until night to draw water. What was once a seasonal hardship is steadily hardening into a permanent condition.The region now stands at a crossroads, where the choices made today will determine whether Barind remains a productive agricultural heartland or slips into a future marked by chronic water stress.Ystiaque Ahmedis a journalist at The Daily Star.

Then Tongue arrived--right arm pumping, eyes locked on the pitch, bowling with purpose.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.Tongue returned outstanding figures of 5-45 as Australia were bowled out for 152 in their first innings on the opening day of the fourth Test.His performance ended a long wait for an England bowler to claim a five-for at the MCG. The last to achieve the feat were Darren Gough and Dean Headley in 1998.The spell was the most successful of Tongue's Test career, bettering his previous best of 5/66 against Ireland at Lord's in 2023. His wickets came at key moments and played a major role in restricting Australia to a low total, despite the hosts having already retained the Ashes.Tongue also finished the innings on a hat-trick after dismissing Michael Neser for 35 and Scott Boland for a duck with the final two balls of the Australian innings.After the innings, Tongue remained characteristically grounded.\"I feel like anyone could have taken a five-fer today,\" he said, deflecting praise.Tongue said the bowling group benefitted from clear plans and consistent execution.\"When I'm at my best, I'm bowling a fuller length and hitting the pitch hard,\" Tongue said. \"Ben Stokes has spoken a lot about that, and if we put the ball in the same areas tomorrow, we can take early wickets.\"Related topic:Josh TongueMSCcricketAshesClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsStokes will be battle-ready for Ashes, says England chief3m agoTaskin continues good form in ILT203d agoHead released from T20I squad to prepare for Ashes1m ago‘This group will provide exciting cricketers’5d agoFakirerpool stun Mohammedan in season’s biggest upset11m ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগেJournalism without fear or favourAbout UsContact UsAppsComment PolicyRSSSitemapAdvertisementNewsletterPrivacy PolicyConference HallArchives© 2025 thedailystar.net | Powered by:RSI LABCopyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

The lead-up to the event, however, carried heartbreak and frustration -- heartbreak in failing to secure direct qualification, and frustration in how, even after eventually booking a place in the mega event, the team were let down by the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) lack of foresight in arranging a proper preparation phase.The Tigresses toured the West Indies in January with direct qualification in line, but a 2-1 series loss forced them into the six-team World Cup Qualifiers in Pakistan in April.Qualification itself came by the narrowest of margins and a near miracle, as Bangladesh grabbed the second spot at the expense of West Indies, who finished just 0.013 behind in net run-rate after both teams secured three wins.There was respite amid the struggle. A ton against Thailand saw skipper Nigar Sultana Joty become the first woman centurion from Bangladesh in an ICC ODI event. Joty and Sharmin Akter Supta finished as the second and third highest run-getters of the qualifiers. The Women's Dhaka Premier League in March also offered encouraging signs, with several batters showing greater tenacity and attacking intent.However, following the league, World Cup preparation plans hit a snag. The Tigresses went into the showpiece without playing a single international bilateral series since the West Indies tour.Instead of competitive international fixtures, camps and tournaments with the national U-15 boys' team were all that BCB could arrange. The lack of competitive preparation showed during the World Cup, particularly in crunch moments.Bangladesh collectively failed to grab close matches by the scruff of the neck, something that might have been different with proper international exposure before the World Cup. They ended with just one win, the same return as in the 2022 edition.This time, however, performances suggested the players were able to rise above their lack of preparation. The explosiveness of the new generation -- Marufa Akter, Rabeya Khan, Rubya Haider and Sobhana Mostary -- stood out as the main takeaways.It was a dream start for Marufa, who, with her inswingers, immediately became one of the stars of the World Cup.Batting concerns had followed the Tigresses, yet the tournament also saw Mostary, the top scorer for Bangladesh in the previous T20 World Cup, and Supta staking claims in the top order.The 23-year-old Mostary led with composure, and while Supta remained the standout in terms of aggregate runs, Mostary created impact. Among the youngsters, Shorna Akter's explosive knock against South Africa and Rabeya's ability to change games with her leg-spin gave Bangladesh's campaign vitality, even as they fell just short in the final hurdles against England, South Africa, and Sri Lanka.As the year edged towards its close, off-field controversies also came to light. Former skipper Jahanara Alam made allegations of sexual abuse against coaches and team management officials near the end of the year, developments that threatened to derail stability.Looking ahead, preparations for the qualifiers in Nepal in January-February, which will determine qualification for the 2026 Women's T20 World Cup in England in June-July, began late this year. The campaign remains in danger of becoming another patched-up effort, with the BCB yet to confirm any international matches ahead of the tournament and continued questions being raised about the standard of domestic cricket.Still, as 2025 draws to a close, the year will be remembered not only for missed opportunities and administrative failures but also for the emergence of a promising core.

The lead-up to the event, however, carried heartbreak and frustration -- heartbreak in failing to secure direct qualification, and frustration in how, even after eventually booking a place in the mega event, the team were let down by the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) lack of foresight in arranging a proper preparation phase.The Tigresses toured the West Indies in January with direct qualification in line, but a 2-1 series loss forced them into the six-team World Cup Qualifiers in Pakistan in April.Qualification itself came by the narrowest of margins and a near miracle, as Bangladesh grabbed the second spot at the expense of West Indies, who finished just 0.013 behind in net run-rate after both teams secured three wins.There was respite amid the struggle. A ton against Thailand saw skipper Nigar Sultana Joty become the first woman centurion from Bangladesh in an ICC ODI event. Joty and Sharmin Akter Supta finished as the second and third highest run-getters of the qualifiers. The Women's Dhaka Premier League in March also offered encouraging signs, with several batters showing greater tenacity and attacking intent.However, following the league, World Cup preparation plans hit a snag. The Tigresses went into the showpiece without playing a single international bilateral series since the West Indies tour.Instead of competitive international fixtures, camps and tournaments with the national U-15 boys' team were all that BCB could arrange. The lack of competitive preparation showed during the World Cup, particularly in crunch moments.Bangladesh collectively failed to grab close matches by the scruff of the neck, something that might have been different with proper international exposure before the World Cup. They ended with just one win, the same return as in the 2022 edition.This time, however, performances suggested the players were able to rise above their lack of preparation. The explosiveness of the new generation -- Marufa Akter, Rabeya Khan, Rubya Haider and Sobhana Mostary -- stood out as the main takeaways.It was a dream start for Marufa, who, with her inswingers, immediately became one of the stars of the World Cup.Batting concerns had followed the Tigresses, yet the tournament also saw Mostary, the top scorer for Bangladesh in the previous T20 World Cup, and Supta staking claims in the top order.The 23-year-old Mostary led with composure, and while Supta remained the standout in terms of aggregate runs, Mostary created impact. Among the youngsters, Shorna Akter's explosive knock against South Africa and Rabeya's ability to change games with her leg-spin gave Bangladesh's campaign vitality, even as they fell just short in the final hurdles against England, South Africa, and Sri Lanka.As the year edged towards its close, off-field controversies also came to light. Former skipper Jahanara Alam made allegations of sexual abuse against coaches and team management officials near the end of the year, developments that threatened to derail stability.Looking ahead, preparations for the qualifiers in Nepal in January-February, which will determine qualification for the 2026 Women's T20 World Cup in England in June-July, began late this year. The campaign remains in danger of becoming another patched-up effort, with the BCB yet to confirm any international matches ahead of the tournament and continued questions being raised about the standard of domestic cricket.Still, as 2025 draws to a close, the year will be remembered not only for missed opportunities and administrative failures but also for the emergence of a promising core. If nurtured with proper planning, competitive exposure, and stability, the performances of this year may yet become the foundation on which Bangladesh women's cricket builds a brighter future.Related topic:Bangladesh Women's Cricket teamNigar Sultana JotyBangladesh Cricket Board (BCB)TigressesClick to commentCommentsComments PolicyRelated NewsTigresses to stick to their 'natural game'2m agoLitton expected to return for Windies T20Is2m agoTigers' home Pakistan series next year set to be held in two phases, says Fahim1w agoTigresses to face men’s U-15 team for World Cup preparation5m agoJoty shines with bat in opening fixture of World Cup preparatory tournament4m ago|বাংলাদেশহাদি হত্যার বিচার দাবি: রাতে অবস্থান চলবে শাহবাগে, দেশব্যাপী অবরোধের হুঁশিয়ারিহাদি হত্যার ন্যায়বিচার নিশ্চিতে যা যা করা হয়েছে, উপদেষ্টাদের শাহবাগে এসে তার ব্যাখ্যা দেওয়ার দাবি জানিয়েছে ইনকিলাব মঞ্চ।৪১ মিনিট আগে|রাজনীতিজাতীয় স্মৃতিসৌধে তারেক রহমানের শ্রদ্ধা নিবেদন১ ঘণ্টা আগে CricketAbdullah Al MehdiFri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AMMost Viewed'This country belongs to people of the hills and plains, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and Christians'Tarique Rahman returns home after 17 years in exileA psychological reset for BNP, a moment of political recalibration for BangladeshZubaida, daughter Zaima reach Gulshan residenceCricketA LOOK BACK AT 2025CricketHope flickers despite hurdlesFri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AMLast update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AMAbdullah Al MehdiFri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AM      Last update on: Fri Dec 26, 2025 08:30 AMHope and despair -- Bangladesh women's cricket team saw both sides of the coin in 2025, as the possibilities shown this year and the turbulence faced both on and off the field left them standing on the precipice of either progress or regression going into the new year.As the year is revisited, a few performances continue to light beacons of hope.For all latest news, follow The Daily Star's Google News channel.The narrative was shaped by the biggest event in Bangladesh women's cricket in 2025, the ODI World Cup held in September-November.

Party leaders and activists will line both sides of the road to greet him.BNP standing committee members, leaders of political parties that joined the simultaneous movement and prominent figures will be present on stage, but only Tarique will address the crowd.Following his address, Tarique will go to Evercare Hospital to visit his ailing mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who has been undergoing treatment there for over a month now.After meeting his mother, he will go to Firoza, the Zia family's residence at Gulshan‑2, via Airport Road and Kakoli Mor.The Dhaka Metropolitan Police has taken multi‑layered security measures to prevent any untoward incident.The party expects around 50 lakh people to gather in Dhaka on the day.The overall responsibility for Tarique's security from the airport to Gulshan has been given to AKM Shamsul Islam.Party‑based security arrangements will be used to the fullest extent including the Chairperson's Security Force (CSF), Shamsul said at a briefing yesterday.Centred on the 300 Feet area, party leaders and activists had already begun streaming into the venue last night.Around 1,000 speakers are being installed across the airport area, Purbachal, Kanchan Bridge, Abdullahpur, Banani, Mohakhali and surrounding locations to broadcast his speech.Hundreds of billboards and posters have been set up along roads between the airport and Gulshan.

There will be a six‑bed temporary field hospital in the 300 Feet area, with an ambulance with ICU facilities. The party has installed mobile toilets and will be providing drinking water. Several thousand volunteers will be engaged in the whole service.Separate bus parking has been arranged at the main entrances to the capital to avoid traffic. To facilitate the movement of patient‑carrying ambulances and international passengers, help desks have been set up in Kakoli Mor, and in front of the airport and Abdullahpur.During the 1/11 government, Tarique was arrested on March 7, 2007. He was granted bail on September 3, 2008, and left for London with his family on September 11 for medical treatment.Tarique has been living in London with his wife, Zubaida Rahman, and daughter, Zaima Rahman. Zubaida Rahman who returned to London on December 20 after a two-week stay in Dhaka with her ailing mother‑in‑law.During Awami League's tenure, Tarique was convicted in absentia in five cases and faced around 100 lawsuits.
