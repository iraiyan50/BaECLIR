The propaganda apparently influenced Washington to impose immigration restrictions on Bangladeshis, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson said. Khaleda also brushed aside Awami League President Sheikh Hasina's claim that the four-party alliance government was to blame for the US decision. \"My government is not responsible at all. It was she and her party who had influenced the decision with anti-Bangladesh statements at home and abroad.\" She said the party portrayed Bangladesh as a communal state when in power to then US President Bill Clinton during his visit in March 2000. The party's propaganda had influenced Clinton's decision to cancel all scheduled programmes including a visit to the Savar National Mausoleum, Khaleda said. The US president spent the whole day in hotel, only attending a Bangabhaban programme, she added. Without naming the AL chief and senior Indian ministers, Khaleda said, \"They used similar words in their statements against Bangladesh. They said the same things at the same time.\" \"It is unfortunate that senior leaders of that country made such false and imaginary allegations against Bangladesh. This is nothing but a deep-rooted conspiracy against Bangladesh.\" The party's campaign and the subsequent US restrictions has thrown hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi students and workers overseas into uncertainty and panic, the prime minister told the Sramik Dal leaders and activists. \"Can the leader be called patriotic? They (AL) have put our independence, sovereignty and economy in jeopardy and are still trying to isolate the country from the world only to avenge their defeat in the elections.\" However, she said, such campaigns would not be successful, as Bangladesh \"has a reputation of being a moderate and democratic country in the world\". Khaleda said she firmly believed that the US \"knows Bangladesh as a moderate country\" and would drop the country from its terror-risk list and withdraw the immigration restrictions. Turning to the industrial sector, the prime minister said her government would close down all losing concerns and set up new ones to create employment for the laid-off workers. About closure of the Adamjee Jute Mills, she said the laid-off workers had been paid their dues and could start small-scale businesses of their own. Besides, the government has plans to convert the mill area into an export processing zone or an information technology (IT) village that would create thousands of jobs. BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, State Minister for Labour and Manpower Lutfar Rahman Khan Azad also addressed the meeting, presided over by Sramik Dal President and Food Minister Abdullah Al Noman.

Relations had deteriorated following Canadian accusations that New Delhi was involved in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh leader – claims India denied. The diplomatic rift severely disrupted consular and trade services between the nations, which exchanged about $9 billion in goods and services in 2023. Relations have improved since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took office in March. Carney met Modi in June, on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, where they agreed to name new high commissioners, as ambassadors are known between Commonwealth nations. Both envoys have since begun work. With US President Donald Trump upending global trade, both India and Canada have been much more agreeable about working together. Anand is also expected to meet India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal and meet business leaders in the financial capital Mumbai. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside India. That community includes activists for ‘Khalistan’, a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority. Ottawa accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan campaigner, and targeting other Sikh activists connected to the movement. The Khalistan campaign dates to India’s 1947 independence and has been blamed for the assassination of a prime minister and the bombing of a passenger jet. It has been a bitter issue between India and several Western nations with large Sikh populations.",

While Bangladesh has done its part thus far, we have been waiting for India to do its, and we heartily welcome the head of state's firm commitment to implementing all pledge-bound but yet unresolved issues soon, as stated in his discussion with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, as well as the foreign and finance ministers. These include the signing of the Teesta Water Sharing Agreement and ratification of the Land Boundary Agreement, the latter in India's current budget session. Though no timeline has been provided, we hope that these will be done at the earliest opportunity. The Indian president has also expressed an interest in the issue of the now to be self-funded Padma Bridge and assured that India would provide its second trench of USD 50 million grant to Bangladesh for the Padma Bridge project next month. President Mukherjee has also expressed his gratitude at his and other Indians' being conferred the \"Friends of Liberation War\" honour. Indeed, the president's visit in fact his first foreign visit since taking office -- despite the current volatile political situation in the country goes to show his goodwill towards Bangladesh. His visit to the Savar Smritishoudho upon arrival, which may otherwise have been considered routine, carries extra significance at a time when the trial of the war criminals and the Shahbagh movement have brought the war of liberation into renewed focus. His concern regarding the current political violence, particularly that carried out against minority communities in Bangladesh, is yet another reminder for ourselves about the political crisis we are currently undergoing and the image of Bangladesh being portrayed around the world. We believe and hope this visit truly holds promise of better things to come in terms of the relationship with our neighbour and regional cooperation in the sub-continent overall.",

        "body": "Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam on Sunday said that one of the major accomplishments of their foreign policy over the past 15 months has been establishing strong relations with the United States agricultural economy and the farm lobby. ‘The interim government has laid the foundation for this promising new chapter in Bangladesh-US relations,’ he said. Looking ahead, Alam said, Bangladesh will be able successfully negotiate even greater tariff reductions from the United States as the trade gap shrinks. ‘Our garment exporters already have the capacity to purchase the entirety of US cotton exports. Once we establish ourselves as a key US trading partner, we will have no need to engage costly lobby groups in Washington — we will have the US farm lobby, which has considerable political strength, to advocate for us with US governmental entities,’ he said. ‘Japan, China, Southeast Asian nations, and Western European countries have all prospered through robust trade with the United States. Now, we too can follow that path,’ Alam said in a message shared from his verified Facebook account. A few months after Khalilur Rahman was appointed as the high representative on Rohingya affairs and later as national security adviser, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus sent him to Washington DC in February to build ties with the new US administration. Khalil, a veteran career diplomat and an eminent economist who spent decades at a senior level at a UN organisation specialising in global trade policy, quickly connected with key figures in the American agricultural sector, he said. Alam said Bangladesh is a major importer of agricultural products, while the US is one of the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, wheat, cotton, and corn. ‘Access to US agricultural market is potentially a crucial aspect of our food security, which is one of our key national security concerns,’ he said. It also would allow us to diversify food import sources and thereby to avoid potential situations where certain sourcing countries might weaponise our food dependence on them. Khalil helped strengthen the bridge between Bangladeshi importers and the US farm lobby — a relationship that played a crucial role in our successful recent tariff negotiations with Washington. ‘Besides, his successful efforts as our lead negotiator contributed to securing competitive tariff rates that have effectively safeguarded Bangladesh’s garment industry,’ Alam said. Earlier this week, Bangladeshi importers pledged to purchase over one billion dollars’ worth of US farm products — a ‘win-win outcome’ for both countries and a milestone in Bangladesh-US relations, said the press secretary. With China sourcing most of its soybeans from Brazil, Bangladesh can, in a meaningful way, help fill the gap left by Chinese importers, he said. This growing agricultural trade partnership, Alam said, is now taking center stage in the two nations’ diplomatic engagement, a vision championed by the interim government.",

The journalists organised the protest rallies under the banner of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists to ensure press freedom and journalists’ welfare. BFUJ faction secretary general Kader Gani Chowdhury presented the 39-point demand at a rally in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka. The BFUJ wants a transformed media environment where journalists can report freely, without fear, and pursue truth with responsibility as the driving force of journalism, Kader Gani said. The nationwide protests reflect journalists’ unity in defending their professional rights and press freedom, he added. Dhaka Union of Journalists’ president Shahidul Islam presided over the rally, while Jatiya Press Club president Hasan Hafiz, BFUJ faction acting president Obaidur Rahman Shahin, DUJ faction general secretary Khurshid Alam, among others, also spoke.

        "body": "সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করতে বা শিক্ষার মানোন্নয়নে শাসকশ্রেণির কোনো ভূমিকা দেখছেন না অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। তিনি বলেন, যাঁরা শাসকশ্রেণির অন্তর্ভুক্ত, তাঁদের সন্তান কিংবা নাতি-নাতনিরা ভালো মানের বেসরকারি ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করেছে, করছে ও করবে। ‘বাংলাদেশে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ: অধিকতর ন্যায়পরায়ণ সমাজের পথরেখা’ শিরোনামে শনিবার রাতে একটি অনুষ্ঠানে বক্তব্য দেন গবেষণা সংস্থা সেন্টার ফর পলিসি ডায়ালগের (সিপিডি) চেয়ারম্যান অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। রাজধানীর বাংলামোটরে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রে এই অনুষ্ঠানের আয়োজন করে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘ। অনুষ্ঠানে অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা বিভক্ত। এই বিভক্তি দূর করতে না পারলে সামনে শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় আরও সামাজিক সংঘাত অপেক্ষা করছে। শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণের জন্য কয়েকটি প্রস্তাব তুলে ধরেন রেহমান সোবহান। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, পাবলিক এডুকেশন (সরকারিভাবে শিক্ষার ব্যবস্থা) এমন একটা পর্যায়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে, যেখানে সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করা যায়। এ জন্য শিক্ষা খাতে বরাদ্দ তিন গুণ বাড়াতে হবে। নিম্ন আয়ের পরিবারের সন্তানদের স্বল্প মেয়াদে ভালো শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে আসন বরাদ্দ রাখা ও বৃত্তি দেওয়ার মতো সহযোগিতা সরকারের দিক থেকে থাকতে পারে বলে প্রস্তাবে উল্লেখ করেন তিনি। অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের নেতারা বছরের পর বছর মাতৃভাষায় মানসম্মত শিক্ষার উন্নয়নে ভূমিকা রাখেননি, যা পূর্ব বা দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়ার দেশগুলো করেছে। এর বিপরীততে দেশে ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানকে উৎসাহিত করা হয়েছে। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, এমনটা করা যেতে পারে, যাঁরা সংসদ সদস্য পদে নির্বাচন করতে চান, তাঁদের সন্তানদের বাধ্যতামূলকভাবে বাংলা মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করাতে হবে। সন্তানেরা সরকারি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়লে এর মান বাড়ানোর চেষ্টা করবেন তাঁরা। তবে তিনি বলেন, এমন প্রত্যাশা তাঁর কল্পনা ছাড়া কিছু নয়। রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, শিক্ষায় নিয়ম ও সুশাসন ফিরিয়ে আনতে হবে। আর এটা তখনই সম্ভব হবে, যখন অর্থ বা পেশিশক্তির পরিবর্তে জবাবদিহি, অন্তর্ভুক্তিমূলক ও গণতান্ত্রিক প্রক্রিয়া প্রতিষ্ঠা করা যাবে। দীর্ঘ মেয়াদে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ করতে হলে রাজনীতিকে গণতান্ত্রিক করতে হবে এবং গণতান্ত্রিক সমাজ লাগবে। গণতান্ত্রিক শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় যাত্রা দীর্ঘ, কিন্তু এই যাত্রা বাধ্যতামূলক। অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এখন পর্যন্ত শিক্ষায় যথেষ্ট গুরুত্ব দেয়নি উল্লেখ করে অনুষ্ঠানে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রের প্রতিষ্ঠাতা অধ্যাপক আবদুল্লাহ আবু সায়ীদ বলেন, শিক্ষা যে সবচেয়ে আনন্দময়, সবচেয়ে উপকারী এবং সমৃদ্ধির ঘটক—এই কথাটা সমাজের মধ্যে আনা যায়নি। দেশের রাজনীতিবিদদের কখনোই দেখা যায়নি যে তাঁরা চিন্তাশীল মানুষের কথা শোনেন। যে কারণে দেশের জ্ঞানী ব্যক্তিদের পরামর্শ ও উপদেশ রাজনীতির ক্ষেত্রে প্রভাব রাখে না। ডেইলি স্টার সম্পাদক মাহ্ফুজ আনাম বলেন, যার যার জায়গা থেকে খুব ক্ষুদ্র স্তরে হলেও পরিবর্তনের সূচনা করতে হবে। গৃহকর্মীদের ছেলেমেয়েদের পড়াশোনার জন্য অর্থ সহযোগিতা দিয়ে এই পরিবর্তনের অংশ হওয়া যেতে পারে বলে মনে করেন তিনি। অনুষ্ঠানের সঞ্চালক ছিলেন বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘের সদস্য সিরাজুল ইসলাম কাদির। আরও বক্তব্য দেন মেটলাইফ বাংলাদেশের প্রধান নির্বাহী কর্মকর্তা আলাউদ্দিন আহমদ। অনুষ্ঠানে আরও উপস্থিত ছিলেন সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো অধ্যাপক রওনক জাহান, অধ্যাপক এম এম আকাশ ও সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো মোস্তাফিজুর রহমান।",

        "body": "ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প গত বছরের শুরুতে দ্বিতীয় মেয়াদে মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট হিসেবে দায়িত্ব নেন। এর পর থেকে এক বছরে দ্বিতীয় বিশ্বযুদ্ধ-পরবর্তী স্থিতিশীল বিশ্বব্যবস্থাকে কার্যত তছনছ করে দিয়েছেন তিনি। তাঁর নেওয়া একের পর এক আগ্রাসী পদক্ষেপ বিশ্বরাজনীতিকে এমন এক অনিশ্চয়তার দিকে ঠেলে দিয়েছে, যা আগে কখনো দেখা যায়নি। ট্রাম্পের মেয়াদ শেষ হতে হতে বিশ্ব হয়তো সম্পূর্ণ অচেনা এক রূপ ধারণ করবে। আগামী জুনে ৮০ বছরে পদার্পণ করতে যাওয়া এই রিপাবলিকান নেতা নতুন বছরের শুরু থেকেই যুদ্ধংদেহী মনোভাবে অবতীর্ণ হয়েছেন। ৩ জানুয়ারি তেলসমৃদ্ধ দেশ ভেনেজুয়েলায় তাঁর নির্দেশে সামরিক অভিযান চালানো হয়। এতে শতাধিক মানুষ নিহত হন। দেশটির বামপন্থী প্রেসিডেন্ট ও যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের দীর্ঘদিনের শত্রু নিকোলা মাদুরোকে তুলে নিয়ে যায় মার্কিন বিশেষ বাহিনী। ভেনেজুয়েলায় অভিযানের পর থেকে শত্রুমিত্র–নির্বিশেষে সবার বিরুদ্ধেই শক্তি প্রয়োগের হুমকি দিচ্ছেন ট্রাম্প। তিনি আবারও ন্যাটোর সদস্যদেশ ডেনমার্কের কাছ থেকে গ্রিনল্যান্ড দখল করার দাবি তুলেছেন। ইরানে সরকারবিরোধী বিক্ষোভ দমনে কড়াকড়ি শুরু হলে সেখানেও হামলার হুঁশিয়ারি দিয়েছেন। এমনকি প্রতিবেশী দেশ মেক্সিকো ও কলম্বিয়াতেও সামরিক হস্তক্ষেপের চিন্তা করছেন বলে মাঝেমধ্যে ইঙ্গিত দিয়েছেন। পরে অবশ্য ওই দুই দেশের প্রেসিডেন্টদের সঙ্গে কথা বলা পর তাঁর এ মনোভাবে পরিবর্তন হয়েছে বলে মনে হয়েছে। ট্রাম্পের সমর্থকেরা বলছেন, তিনি নিজের অনুকূলে কোনো ফলাফল পাওয়ার আগপর্যন্ত কোনো কূটনৈতিক সমাধানের পথে হাঁটেন না। ট্রাম্প ‘আমেরিকা ফার্স্ট’ বা সবার আগে যুক্তরাষ্ট্র রূপকল্প বাস্তবায়নে রাষ্ট্র পরিচালনার চিরাচরিত পদ্ধতিগুলো ভেঙে ‘একলা চলো’ নীতি গ্রহণ করেছেন। এ ধারাবাহিকতায় সবশেষ জাতিসংঘের সংস্থাসহ ডজনখানেক আন্তর্জাতিক সংস্থা থেকে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রকে প্রত্যাহার করে নেন তিনি। মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী মার্কো রুবিও ট্রাম্পের এ পদক্ষেপকে সমর্থন করে বলেছেন, অনেক আন্তর্জাতিক সংস্থা এখন শুধু বিশ্বায়নবাদীদের এজেন্ডা বাস্তবায়ন করছে। শুধু দেশের বাইরে নয়, ভেতরেও ট্রাম্প প্রশাসনের বিরুদ্ধে দমন-পীড়ন চালানোর অভিযোগ উঠেছে। তাঁর প্রশাসন সম্প্রতি মার্কিন ভাইস প্রেসিডেন্ট জেডি ভ্যান্সের নেতৃত্বে মিনিয়াপোলিসে অভিবাসনবিরোধী অভিযান চালায়। সেখানে এক অভিবাসন কর্মকর্তা রেনি গুড (৩৭) নামের এক নারীকে গুলি করে হত্যা করেন। এ ঘটনায় ট্রাম্প কিংবা তাঁর প্রশাসন লোকদেখানো সহানুভূতিও দেখায়নি, উল্টো দমন-পীড়নের মাত্রা বাড়িয়ে দিয়েছে। হোয়াইট হাউসের ডেপুটি চিফ অব স্টাফ এবং ট্রাম্পের অভিবাসনবিরোধী নীতির রূপকার স্টিফেন মিলার সিএনএনকে দেওয়া এক সাক্ষাৎকারে বলেন, বাস্তব পৃথিবী চলে শক্তি ও ক্ষমতা দিয়ে। এখন আর আন্তর্জাতিক সৌজন্য দেখানোর সময় নেই। পর্যবেক্ষকেরা বলছেন, অতীতের মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্টদের সঙ্গে ট্রাম্পের মূল পার্থক্য হলো, তিনি কোনো আদর্শ বা গণতন্ত্র রক্ষার ভানটুকুও করেন না, যেমন ভেনেজুয়েলায় গণতন্ত্র ফেরানোর চেয়ে দেশটির তেলের ওপর নিয়ন্ত্রণ নেওয়াকেই অগ্রাধিকার দিচ্ছেন তিনি। ফরাসি প্রেসিডেন্ট এমানুয়েল মাখোঁ সতর্ক করে বলেছেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের এ নীতি ‘নব্য উপনিবেশবাদ’ ও ‘সাম্রাজ্যবাদের’ নতুন যুগের সূচনা করতে পারে। তাঁর মতে, যুক্তরাষ্ট্র নিজের তৈরি আন্তর্জাতিক নিয়মগুলো নিজেই ভেঙে ফেলছে। ব্রুকিংস ইনস্টিটিউশনের বিশেষজ্ঞ মেলানি সিসন মনে করেন, দ্বিতীয় বিশ্বযুদ্ধ-পরবর্তী সেই চেনা বিশ্বব্যবস্থা আর ফিরে আসার সম্ভাবনা কম। ট্রাম্প বিশ্বরাজনীতিতে যে পরিবর্তন আনছেন, তা দীর্ঘস্থায়ী হবে এবং অন্য শক্তিগুলোও এখন শুধু নিজেদের স্বার্থ চরিতার্থ করতে ব্যস্ত থাকবে। তবে নাম প্রকাশে অনিচ্ছুক যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের এক মিত্রদেশের কূটনীতিকের মতে, বিশ্বব্যবস্থা যে আগে থেকেই ভেঙে পড়েছিল, ট্রাম্প সেটাই আঙুল দিয়ে দেখিয়ে দিচ্ছেন মাত্র।",

        "body": "Hundreds of women protested in Mexico City on Tuesday against gender-based violence, which kills an average of 10 women or girls every day in Mexico, according to official data. Mexican lawyer Alejandra Perez said she lives in fear every day since the violence she faced from her ex-partner temporarily left her disabled. But the 37-year-old summoned the courage to join the protest to denounce the impunity of many perpetrators of gender-based violence in Mexico, and marched holding a poster showing the man she accuses of attacking her. ‘I filed a complaint against him three years ago, and this man is still at large,’ she said of her daughter’s father. ‘The system is very slow. Unfortunately many women have to conduct their own investigations.’ The United Nations reports that 70 per cent of Mexican women over the age of 15 have experienced some form of aggression at least once in their lives. Mexican parliamentary records indicate 3,430 women died violent deaths in Mexico in 2024, with 829 victims of femicide, a crime defined as murder motivated by a victim’s gender. Mexico is experiencing a wave of feminist fervour fuelled by anger over the high number of assaults and the impunity of perpetrators. President Claudia Sheinbaum recently launched a nationwide drive against sexual harassment and abuse, after a shocking video of a man groping her brought the widespread issue into stark focus. The country’s first woman leader presented a plan to ensure prison sentences for sexual abuse across Mexico and to encourage women to report incidents to police. The 63-year-old leader was accosted as she walked through Mexico City when a seemingly drunk man put his arm around her shoulder, touched her hip and chest, and attempted to kiss her neck, before a member of the president’s security detail pulled him away.",

        "body": "Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan’s rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit. The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences – 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine – will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the sentencing, the former prime minister’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan’s legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours. They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case. He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.",

        "body": "Bangladesh interim government has promulgated the Enforced Disappearance Prevention and Remedies Ordinance, 2025 with the provisions of death penalty and life imprisonment for those to be found guilty of involvement in incidents of enforced disappearances. The Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division under the Ministry of Law issued a gazette late on Monday. The Council of Advisers approved the draft of the ordinance on November 6. According to the ordinance, tribunals will be set up at district and divisional levels to deal with the cases of prevention and prosecution of enforced disappearances. Offences under the ordinance are non-bailable and non-compoundable. As per the ordinance, if the victim dies as a result of enforced disappearance or if the person cannot be found alive or dead even five years after the disappearance, the offender may be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. If any public servant or member of a law enforcement agency arrests, detains, abducts, or otherwise deprives a person of liberty and deny the act or concealing the fate or whereabouts of the person, thereby placing the individual outside the protection of the law may face life imprisonment or a prison term of up to 10 years, it says. Anyone found to have destroyed evidence of disappearance, or constructed, installed, or used secret detention centres for enforced disappearances may face up to seven years in prison. The ordinance also sets out penalties for senior officers or commanders of law enforcement agencies. It states that if a superior officer orders, authorises, approves, consents to or instigates the commission of such crimes by subordinates or participates in the crime he or she will face the same punishment prescribed for the offence. A superior may also be punished if negligence, incompetence, or failure to maintain discipline or control enables subordinates to commit an enforced disappearance, the ordinance says. It further states that the location of an arrested person may be kept confidential ‘in the interest of state security’ until the person is produced before a magistrate. Trials may proceed in absentia if the accused is on the run.",

        "body": "A massive protest rally demanding justice for Inqilab Mancha spokesperson Sharif Osman Bin Hadi was held at the Shahbagh intersection in the capital on Saturday. Inqilab Mancha organised the rally. It gave 24hrs ultimatum to arrest Hadi’s killers. Following Hadi’s burial on the Dhaka University campus, thousands of protesters gathered at Shahbagh. Processions from different parts of the city arrived in succession and eventually converged at the busy intersection to press their demand for justice over his killing. During the demonstration, protesters raised slogans including “Delhi or Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka,” “Modi or Hadi? Hadi, Hadi,” “We want justice,” and “Catch Awami League, put them behind bars.” The protesters began dispersing around 5:15pm, after which traffic gradually resumed on the Shahbagh-Matsya Bhaban, Shahbagh-Karwan Bazar, and Shahbagh-Science Lab roads, which had remained blocked during the protest. Some demonstrators were also seen hurling shoes at an effigy bearing the photograph of Law Adviser Asif Nazrul during the rally. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Inqilab Mancha and secretary of the Liberation War and Democratic Movement of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, called on people to join the protest. “Everyone come to Shahbagh,” she wrote in a Facebook post following Hadi’s funeral. For security reasons, law enforcement agencies barricaded the road from Hotel InterContinental Dhaka towards Minto Road. A large contingent of police, APBn, and Border Guard Bangladesh personnel was deployed in the area, while water cannons and armoured personnel carriers were also positioned at the site. Earlier in the day, Sharif Osman Hadi was laid to rest beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on the Dhaka University campus after his namaz-e-janaza was held at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad under tight security. From the morning, mourners had gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in small processions to attend the funeral prayer, which was joined by a large crowd.Hadi’s death has sparked protests in Dhaka and several other districts since Thursday night, with demonstrators continuing to demand justice for him.",

        "title": "Nepal mourns its dead after anti-corruption protests",
        "body": "Nepal flew flags at half-mast during a national day of mourning Wednesday for the 73 people killed during youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the government. An interim government, which took over after two days of protests last week, declared the day of mourning ‘in honour of those who lost their lives during the protests’, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement. Protests began on September 8, sparked by a short-lived ban on social media, but fuelled by anger at corruption and long-standing economic woes. At least 19 people were killed in a crackdown on the first day. Anger over the deaths escalated, triggering an outpouring of rage nationwide, with government offices, a Hilton Hotel and other buildings set on fire. ‘The changes we are witnessing today would not be possible without the courage and sacrifice of those who gave their lives during the protests,’ Hami Nepal, a key organisation in the protests, posted on social media. Prime minister Sushila Karki, a 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protester demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months. Karki has declared the victims martyrs, promising state honours at their cremations. Shopkeeper Pooja Shrestha, 22, said that the day of mourning would bring people together. ‘Everyone is sad about what happened, the loss of lives — all young people like us,’ she said. ‘Things have improved now, and we hope the new government will bring the changes we need.’ A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447. Streets have been back to bustling business since the protests, but were quieter on Wednesday because it was declared a public holiday. But Lokesh Tamang, 17, sitting in a gift shop in Kathmandu, kept the store open hoping for business after it was closed for days during the unrest. He recalled the ‘intense’ violence and mourned the ‘sad’ deaths of the protesters. ‘We hope that it doesn’t get as bad as it did last week ever again,’ he said. Police spokesman Binod Kharel said Wednesday that the death toll from the protests had risen to 73, including police officers and prisoners as they staged a mass breakout. More than a third of the 13,500 prisoners who escaped from two dozen jails during the protests have been recaptured or surrendered themselves, he added. ‘So far about 5,000 prisoners who had absconded have returned to the prisons, many voluntarily,’ Kharel said.",

        "title": "Nepal PM holds first talks since protests with parties, ‘Gen Z’",
        "body": "Nepal’s interim leader has held the first talks between political parties and youth representatives since last month’s deadly anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, officials said on Thursday. ‘We have succeeded in creating an environment of cooperation and trust by ending the state of lack of dialogue,’ prime minister Sushila Karki, the former chief justice appointed as interim leader, said in a statement on social media. The unrest on September 8-9 was triggered by a brief ban on social media, although it was fuelled by long-standing frustration over economic hardship and corruption. At least 73 people were killed during the two days of unrest, which left parliament, courts and government buildings in flames. Karki, 73, who will lead the Himalayan nation until elections, held a four-hour meeting with youth representatives on Wednesday, according to her media coordinator Ram Rawal. The challenges ahead to ensure the March 2026 elections pass off smoothly are huge — including deep public distrust in Nepal’s established parties. The meeting, headed by Karki, was attended by all major political parties and several ‘Gen Z’ representatives, Rawal said. Also included were representatives of the party of ousted former prime minister KP Sharma Oli, the Communist Party of Nepal — Unified Marxist Leninist. ‘After the protest, there was a trust gap between them,’ Rawal said. ‘This meeting has helped create an environment of trust for the upcoming elections.’ Karki said in a post on X that ‘the new generation, political parties and the government all have the same goal — to hold fair, secure and timely elections’. She has pledged to restore order and address calls for clean governance in the country of 30 million. Minister for Communication Jagadish Kharel told reporters after the meeting that it was ‘important and fruitful’. The unrest in September hit Nepal’s already fragile economy. The World Bank estimates a ‘staggering’ 82 per cent of the workforce is in informal employment, while GDP per capita stood at just $1,447 in 2024.",

        "body": "Tensions mounted near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Tuesday as hundreds of activists from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) clashed with police during a protest over the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh. Carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans, the protesters broke through multiple police barricades, forcing security personnel to struggle to contain the crowd in the high-security diplomatic zone, according to Indian media, including PTI and ANI. Police had earlier stepped up security in the area in anticipation of the demonstration announced by Hindu right-wing groups, citing concerns over the death of a Hindu youth in a lynch-mob attack in Bangladesh. Besides, hundreds of protesters attempted to march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata but were stopped by police. The march, titled ‘Hindu Hunkar Padayatra’, was organised under the banner of Bongiyo Hindu Jagaran, reports PTI. The procession began from Sealdah and was heading towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission when police intercepted it in the Beckbagan area. Police set up barricades to prevent the protesters from advancing, witnesses said. A large contingent of police personnel was deployed in and around the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission office to maintain law and order amid the protest. Dipu Chandra Das, 28, a garment worker, was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Bhaluka Upazila of Mymensingh district December 18 and his body was later set on fire. Bangladesh on Tuesday expressed grave concern to the government of India over incidents involving extremist elements, including disturbances outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the official residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma and expressed deep concern over violent protests staged outside the premises of the different Diplomatic Missions of Bangladesh in India. Bangladesh condemned such acts of premeditated violence or intimidation against diplomatic establishments, which not only endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance. The government of Bangladesh called upon the government of India to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents, to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts and to ensure safety and security of Bangladesh’s diplomatic missions and related facilities in India. The government of Bangladesh expects the government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

        "body": "Leaders of different political, social and workers' organisations have strongly protested the fuel price hike terming it an anti-people decision of the government. They urged the government to withdraw the decision immediately. The fuel price hike would multiply the sufferings of the people as it would lead to rise in transport fare and price of essentials, they said. The fuel price hike would also have a negative impact on the agriculture output, they observed. At a protest rally in the city yesterday, the leaders of Dhaka City Awami League said the fuel price hike would push the people to a miserable condition. City AL president and former mayor Mohammad Hanif, AL organising secretary Abdul Mannan, Abdus Shahid, Jahangir Kabir Nanak and Miza Azam MP spoke at the rally in front of the Awami League office at Bangabandhu Avenue. It also took out a procession in the city yesterday protesting the government's decision. Chairman of Jatiya Party Anwar Hossain Monju and general secretary Sheikh Shahidul Islam in a joint statement said the government raised the fuel price in an 'undemocratic' way. It increased the fuel price through an executive order without discussing the issue in the Jatiya Sangsad, they added. The government has raised the price bypassing the Jatiya Sangsad, although it always calls for making the parliament effective, the Jatiya Party leaders said. They urged the government to make necessary reforms in the energy sector and check system loss. The Bangladesh Sanjukta Sramik Federation (BSSF) leaders observed that the fuel price hike would multiply the sufferings of the low-income group and create anarchy in the transport sector. In a joint statement, BSSF President Mokhlesur Rahman and general secretary Mokaddem Hossain said the government increased the price without considering the living standard of general people. High price in international market do not justify the fuel price hike as the living standard of general people in Bangladesh do not match with the international standard, they said. Expressing concern over the government decision, Bangladesh Krishak League President Hazi Rashed Mosharraf and general secretary Harun or-Rashid Hawladar said it would bring disaster to the country's agriculture sector. Four left-leaning political parties - Jatiya Gono Front, Biplobi Oikya Front, Gonotantrik Mojdur Party and Gonsonghati Andolon - termed the step anti-people and urged the government to withdraw the decision immediately. They called upon the people to build up resistance against such anti-people steps. The other oranisations which gave statement protesting the decision include The Gontantrik Biplobi Jote, Bangladesh Truck Chalok Sramik Federation, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal also protested the fuel price hike.",

যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "কোভিডের সময় থেকেই বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতির গতি কমতে শুরু করে। এরপর রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধের জেরে তেলের দাম বেড়ে যাওয়া এবং ডলার–সংকটের কারণে অর্থনীতি আরেক দফা ধাক্কা খায়। এই বাস্তবতায় ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনের পর অর্থনীতি যখন স্থিতিশীল হতে শুরু করে, তখন গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের মধ্য দিয়ে সরকারের পতন হলো। দেশে ড. মুহাম্মদ ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকার গঠিত হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতিতে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে এখন কী করা দরকার, সে বিষয়ে আন্তর্জাতিক গণমাধ্যমগুলো বিভিন্ন ধরনের ব্যাখ্যা-বিশ্লেষণ দিচ্ছে। সেই সঙ্গে শেখ হাসিনার পতনের কারণসমূহও তুলে ধরছে গণমাধ্যমগুলো। তারা বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার মূল কারণ হিসেবে তরুণদের বেকারত্বকেই চিহ্নিত করেছে। এ ছাড়া কাঠামোগত বিভিন্ন চ্যালেঞ্জের কথাও জানিয়েছে তারা। নতুন সরকারের কী করণীয়, সে বিষয়েও বিদেশি গণমাধ্যমগুলো মোটামুটি একই সুরে কথা বলেছে। জার্মান সংবাদমাধ্যম ডয়চে ভেলের সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশে তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থানের মূল কারণ হলো বেকারত্ব। প্রতিবছর বিপুলসংখ্যক তরুণ কর্মবাজারে প্রবেশ করছেন; যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "গত রাজনৈতিক সরকারের আমলে দেশের অর্থনৈতিক সাফল্যের যে গল্প শুনেছি আমরা, সেটি দাঁড়িয়ে ছিল এক নড়বড়ে ভিত্তির ওপর। প্রবৃদ্ধির চটকদার শিরোনামের আড়ালে চাপা পড়েছিল অর্থনীতির গভীর কাঠামোগত দুর্বলতা। বছরের পর বছর ধরে চলা অসামঞ্জস্যতা একদিকে বাড়িয়েছে ঋণের বোঝা, অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকিং খাতের অনিয়মের কারণে খেলাপি ঋণের হার পৌঁছেছে সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বের কয়টা দেশে ব্যাংক খাতের খেলাপি ঋণ ৩৫ শতাংশের বেশি, সেটি খুঁজে পাওয়া দুষ্কর। শুধু কি খেলাপি ঋণ? আস্থার সংকটে ২০২২ থেকে ২০২৪ সালের মাঝামাঝি সময়ের মধ্যে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ কমেছে প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ। পুঁজি পাচার হয়েছে ব্যাপকভাবে। আর মূল্যস্ফীতি উঠেছিল এক যুগের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায়। সুদের হারের কৃত্রিম সীমা আরোপ এবং বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের টাকা ছাপানোর আগ্রাসী নীতি মূল্যস্ফীতির আগুনকে আরও উসকে দিয়েছিল। তথ্যের অস্বচ্ছতা পরিস্থিতির প্রকৃত ভয়াবহতাকে আড়াল করে রেখেছিল, যা শেষ পর্যন্ত রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতার পথ প্রশস্ত করে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থান এবং গণমানুষের দাবির মুখে গঠিত অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এরই মধ্যে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিকে স্থিতিশীল করার ক্ষেত্রে দৃশ্যমান অগ্রগতি অর্জন করেছে। আমদানিতে কঠোরতা এবং বাজারভিত্তিক বিনিময় হার চালুর ফলে প্রবাসী আয়ে শক্তিশালী প্রবৃদ্ধি দেখা গেছে, যার সুবাদে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ ৩০ শতাংশেরও বেশি পুনরুদ্ধার হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি কিছুটা সহনীয় পর্যায়ে এসেছে এবং সম্পদের গুণগত মান পর্যালোচনা ও কঠোর তদারকির মাধ্যমে খেলাপি ঋণ সংকট মোকাবিলায় প্রাথমিক পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। তবুও, এই ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর প্রক্রিয়াটি এখনো নাজুক। ব্যবসায়ীদের বিনিয়োগের আস্থায় চিড়, শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ কমে যাওয়া এবং দীর্ঘস্থায়ী রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে গত বছর শেষে মোট দেশজ উৎপাদনের (জিডিপি) প্রবৃদ্ধি চার শতাংশের নিচে নামার শঙ্কা রয়েছে। এমন এক বাস্তবতায় রাজনৈতিক স্বচ্ছতা অর্থনীতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ধারণে বড় নির্ণায়ক হিসেবে দেখা দিয়েছে। নির্বাচিত সরকারের কাছে ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তরের প্রক্রিয়া নিয়ে সৃষ্ট অনিশ্চয়তা বিনিয়োগকারীদের মনোজগতে চাপ সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দীর্ঘ প্রবাস জীবনের পর তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফিরে আসায় সেই অনিশ্চয়তা কিছুটা কাটতে শুরু করে। তাঁকে ঘিরে ব্যবসায়ীসহ দেশবাসীর প্রত্যাশাও বেড়েছে। এটি মধ্য মেয়াদে অর্থনীতির জন্য একটি গঠনমূলক বা ইতিবাচকই বলা যায়। এই অবস্থায় আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল বা আইএমএফের পূর্বাভাসে বলা হয়েছে, চলতি বছর জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি প্রায় ৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত হতে পারে। এদিকে, সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিতে কিছুটা স্থিতিশীলতা এলেও দেশের পুঁজিবাজার বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাঙ্ক্ষিত প্রত্যাশা পূরণে ব্যর্থ হচ্ছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) প্রধান সূচক ডিএসইএক্স বহু বছরের মধ্যে সর্বনিম্ন পর্যায়ে ঘোরাফেরা করছে। ভালো ভালো অনেক কোম্পানির শেয়ারের দাম কমে তলানিতে ঠেকেছে। আঞ্চলিক শেয়ারবাজারগুলোর উত্থান সত্ত্বেও আমাদের শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগকারীদের অংশগ্রহণ আশঙ্কাজনকভাবে কমে গেছে। এই পশ্চাৎপদতা মূলত কাঠামোগত। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ভালো মানের কোনো কোম্পানি বাজারে আসেনি। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার অদক্ষতা, ব্যাংক ঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরশীলতা, ফিক্সড ইনকাম বা সঞ্চয়পত্রের উচ্চ সুদ এবং প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারীর অভাব বাজারে তারল্য সংকট ও আস্থার ঘাটতিকে স্থায়ী রূপ দিয়েছে। বাংলাদেশ এখন একটি ঐতিহাসিক সন্ধিক্ষণে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির স্থিতিশীলতা, রিজার্ভের উন্নতি এবং রাজনৈতিক উত্তরণ পুঁজিবাজারকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করার একটি সংকীর্ণ কিন্তু অর্থবহ সুযোগ তৈরি করেছে। এই সুযোগ কাজে লাগিয়ে শেয়ারবাজারের টেকসই পুনরুদ্ধার নিশ্চিত করতে প্রয়োজন একটি সমন্বিত সংস্কার কর্মসূচি। তার জন্য কাঠামোগত বাধাগুলো দূর করার মাধ্যমে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বাজার উন্নয়নের পথ সুগম করতে হবে। ভালো কোম্পানি যাতে শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত হতে আগ্রহী হয় সে জন্য কোম্পানিগুলোকে রাজস্ব নীতির মাধ্যমে উৎসাহিত করা- এখন সময়ের দাবি। তালিকাভুক্ত এবং অ-তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানির করপোরেট করের ব্যবধান ১০ থেকে ১৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত করতে হবে। পাশাপাশি, করমুক্ত লভ্যাংশ বা ডিভিডেন্ড আয় জনগণকে শেয়ারবাজারমুখী করবে। বাজারে বিনিয়োগকারীর অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে, বাজারের গভীরতাও তত বাড়বে। একই সঙ্গে পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার সংস্কারও সমানভাবে জরুরি। একটি সুশৃঙ্খল বাজারের জন্য ডিজিটাল আর্থিক রিপোর্টিং, ভালো কোম্পানি বাজারে আনার পথ সহজ করার মাধ্যমে বাজারে ভালো শেয়ারের সরবরাহ বাড়াতে হবে। এতে ব্যাংকঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরতা কমবে। অন্যদিকে শক্তিশালী করপোরেট সুশাসন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। এ জন্য স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জগুলোকেও শক্তিশালী করতে হবে। যাতে স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের পক্ষ থেকে বাজারে তদারকি জোরদার করা যায়। সেটি হলে বিনিয়োগকারীদের সুরক্ষা বাড়বে। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির ক্ষেত্রে কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হচ্ছে সংস্কার। পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা বিএসইসির কার্যকারিতা এবং জবাবদিহি বাড়ানোর পাশাপাশি রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত বিনিয়োগ সংস্থা ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করপোরেশন অব বাংলাদেশকে (আইসিবি) পুনরুজ্জীবিত করতে হবে। তাতে নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার প্রতি বিনিয়োগকারীদের বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা বাড়বে। এ ছাড়া, আন্তসংস্থা সমন্বয় এবং উন্নত আর্থিক সাক্ষরতা অত্যন্ত জরুরি। সেই সঙ্গে বেসরকারি খাতের কোম্পানির তালিকাভুক্তিতে প্রণোদনা এবং সঞ্চয়পত্রের সুদহারের যৌক্তিকীকরণের মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক ও পুঁজিবাজারের মধ্যে ভারসাম্য আনতে হবে, তাতে বাজারে তারল্য সরবরাহ বাড়বে। পুঁজিবাজারের টেকসই প্রবৃদ্ধি নির্ভর করে একটি শক্তিশালী প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারী ভিত্তি তৈরির ওপর। তার জন্য জরুরি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড শিল্পের বিকাশ। পেশাদার তহবিল ব্যবস্থাপকদের মাধ্যমে পরিচালিত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে বাজারে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বিনিয়োগের সংস্কৃতিও তৈরি হবে। তাতে বাজারে অস্থিরতা কমবে; কিন্তু দুঃখজনকভাবে দেশের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড খাতটি এখনো প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে রয়েছে। ভারতের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার দেশটির জিডিপির প্রায় ২০ শতাংশ। সেখানে বাংলাদেশে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার জিডিপির মাত্র শূন্য দশমিক ২ শতাংশ। পুঁজিবাজারকে যদি মৌলিক ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করাতে হয়, তবে এই অনুপাত উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বাড়াতে হবে। এ জন্য প্রয়োজন লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিসহায়তা। মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে বিনিয়োগের কর রেয়াত সুবিধা ১৫ শতাংশ থেকে বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা, ৫ লাখ টাকা পর্যন্ত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের লভ্যাংশ আয়কে করমুক্ত রাখা এবং আইপিওতে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের কোটা বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা হলে তাতে খাতটি বড় হবে। এ ছাড়া বেমেয়াদি ও মেয়াদি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে ব্যাংকের বিনিয়োগের ওপর বিদ্যমান ১৫ শতাংশের সীমা তুলে নেওয়া প্রয়োজন। কারণ, এই সীমাবদ্ধতা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক পুঁজি বিনিয়োগকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করছে। যদি এই সংস্কারগুলো ধারাবাহিকভাবে বাস্তবায়ন করা যায়, তবে দেশের পুঁজিবাজারও দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধির একটি শক্তিশালী ভিতে পরিণত হবে। লেখক পরিচিতি: ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক ও প্রধান নির্বাহী, ভ্যানগার্ড অ্যাসেট ম্যানেজমেন্ট",

        "body": "গত রাজনৈতিক সরকারের আমলে দেশের অর্থনৈতিক সাফল্যের যে গল্প শুনেছি আমরা, সেটি দাঁড়িয়ে ছিল এক নড়বড়ে ভিত্তির ওপর। প্রবৃদ্ধির চটকদার শিরোনামের আড়ালে চাপা পড়েছিল অর্থনীতির গভীর কাঠামোগত দুর্বলতা। বছরের পর বছর ধরে চলা অসামঞ্জস্যতা একদিকে বাড়িয়েছে ঋণের বোঝা, অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকিং খাতের অনিয়মের কারণে খেলাপি ঋণের হার পৌঁছেছে সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বের কয়টা দেশে ব্যাংক খাতের খেলাপি ঋণ ৩৫ শতাংশের বেশি, সেটি খুঁজে পাওয়া দুষ্কর। শুধু কি খেলাপি ঋণ? আস্থার সংকটে ২০২২ থেকে ২০২৪ সালের মাঝামাঝি সময়ের মধ্যে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ কমেছে প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ। পুঁজি পাচার হয়েছে ব্যাপকভাবে। আর মূল্যস্ফীতি উঠেছিল এক যুগের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায়। সুদের হারের কৃত্রিম সীমা আরোপ এবং বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের টাকা ছাপানোর আগ্রাসী নীতি মূল্যস্ফীতির আগুনকে আরও উসকে দিয়েছিল। তথ্যের অস্বচ্ছতা পরিস্থিতির প্রকৃত ভয়াবহতাকে আড়াল করে রেখেছিল, যা শেষ পর্যন্ত রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতার পথ প্রশস্ত করে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থান এবং গণমানুষের দাবির মুখে গঠিত অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এরই মধ্যে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিকে স্থিতিশীল করার ক্ষেত্রে দৃশ্যমান অগ্রগতি অর্জন করেছে। আমদানিতে কঠোরতা এবং বাজারভিত্তিক বিনিময় হার চালুর ফলে প্রবাসী আয়ে শক্তিশালী প্রবৃদ্ধি দেখা গেছে, যার সুবাদে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ ৩০ শতাংশেরও বেশি পুনরুদ্ধার হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি কিছুটা সহনীয় পর্যায়ে এসেছে এবং সম্পদের গুণগত মান পর্যালোচনা ও কঠোর তদারকির মাধ্যমে খেলাপি ঋণ সংকট মোকাবিলায় প্রাথমিক পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। তবুও, এই ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর প্রক্রিয়াটি এখনো নাজুক। ব্যবসায়ীদের বিনিয়োগের আস্থায় চিড়, শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ কমে যাওয়া এবং দীর্ঘস্থায়ী রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে গত বছর শেষে মোট দেশজ উৎপাদনের (জিডিপি) প্রবৃদ্ধি চার শতাংশের নিচে নামার শঙ্কা রয়েছে। এমন এক বাস্তবতায় রাজনৈতিক স্বচ্ছতা অর্থনীতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ধারণে বড় নির্ণায়ক হিসেবে দেখা দিয়েছে। নির্বাচিত সরকারের কাছে ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তরের প্রক্রিয়া নিয়ে সৃষ্ট অনিশ্চয়তা বিনিয়োগকারীদের মনোজগতে চাপ সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দীর্ঘ প্রবাস জীবনের পর তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফিরে আসায় সেই অনিশ্চয়তা কিছুটা কাটতে শুরু করে। তাঁকে ঘিরে ব্যবসায়ীসহ দেশবাসীর প্রত্যাশাও বেড়েছে। এটি মধ্য মেয়াদে অর্থনীতির জন্য একটি গঠনমূলক বা ইতিবাচকই বলা যায়। এই অবস্থায় আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল বা আইএমএফের পূর্বাভাসে বলা হয়েছে, চলতি বছর জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি প্রায় ৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত হতে পারে। এদিকে, সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিতে কিছুটা স্থিতিশীলতা এলেও দেশের পুঁজিবাজার বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাঙ্ক্ষিত প্রত্যাশা পূরণে ব্যর্থ হচ্ছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) প্রধান সূচক ডিএসইএক্স বহু বছরের মধ্যে সর্বনিম্ন পর্যায়ে ঘোরাফেরা করছে। ভালো ভালো অনেক কোম্পানির শেয়ারের দাম কমে তলানিতে ঠেকেছে। আঞ্চলিক শেয়ারবাজারগুলোর উত্থান সত্ত্বেও আমাদের শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগকারীদের অংশগ্রহণ আশঙ্কাজনকভাবে কমে গেছে। এই পশ্চাৎপদতা মূলত কাঠামোগত। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ভালো মানের কোনো কোম্পানি বাজারে আসেনি। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার অদক্ষতা, ব্যাংক ঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরশীলতা, ফিক্সড ইনকাম বা সঞ্চয়পত্রের উচ্চ সুদ এবং প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারীর অভাব বাজারে তারল্য সংকট ও আস্থার ঘাটতিকে স্থায়ী রূপ দিয়েছে। বাংলাদেশ এখন একটি ঐতিহাসিক সন্ধিক্ষণে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির স্থিতিশীলতা, রিজার্ভের উন্নতি এবং রাজনৈতিক উত্তরণ পুঁজিবাজারকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করার একটি সংকীর্ণ কিন্তু অর্থবহ সুযোগ তৈরি করেছে। এই সুযোগ কাজে লাগিয়ে শেয়ারবাজারের টেকসই পুনরুদ্ধার নিশ্চিত করতে প্রয়োজন একটি সমন্বিত সংস্কার কর্মসূচি। তার জন্য কাঠামোগত বাধাগুলো দূর করার মাধ্যমে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বাজার উন্নয়নের পথ সুগম করতে হবে। ভালো কোম্পানি যাতে শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত হতে আগ্রহী হয় সে জন্য কোম্পানিগুলোকে রাজস্ব নীতির মাধ্যমে উৎসাহিত করা- এখন সময়ের দাবি। তালিকাভুক্ত এবং অ-তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানির করপোরেট করের ব্যবধান ১০ থেকে ১৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত করতে হবে। পাশাপাশি, করমুক্ত লভ্যাংশ বা ডিভিডেন্ড আয় জনগণকে শেয়ারবাজারমুখী করবে। বাজারে বিনিয়োগকারীর অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে, বাজারের গভীরতাও তত বাড়বে। একই সঙ্গে পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার সংস্কারও সমানভাবে জরুরি। একটি সুশৃঙ্খল বাজারের জন্য ডিজিটাল আর্থিক রিপোর্টিং, ভালো কোম্পানি বাজারে আনার পথ সহজ করার মাধ্যমে বাজারে ভালো শেয়ারের সরবরাহ বাড়াতে হবে। এতে ব্যাংকঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরতা কমবে। অন্যদিকে শক্তিশালী করপোরেট সুশাসন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। এ জন্য স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জগুলোকেও শক্তিশালী করতে হবে। যাতে স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের পক্ষ থেকে বাজারে তদারকি জোরদার করা যায়। সেটি হলে বিনিয়োগকারীদের সুরক্ষা বাড়বে। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির ক্ষেত্রে কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হচ্ছে সংস্কার। পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা বিএসইসির কার্যকারিতা এবং জবাবদিহি বাড়ানোর পাশাপাশি রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত বিনিয়োগ সংস্থা ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করপোরেশন অব বাংলাদেশকে (আইসিবি) পুনরুজ্জীবিত করতে হবে। তাতে নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার প্রতি বিনিয়োগকারীদের বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা বাড়বে। এ ছাড়া, আন্তসংস্থা সমন্বয় এবং উন্নত আর্থিক সাক্ষরতা অত্যন্ত জরুরি। সেই সঙ্গে বেসরকারি খাতের কোম্পানির তালিকাভুক্তিতে প্রণোদনা এবং সঞ্চয়পত্রের সুদহারের যৌক্তিকীকরণের মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক ও পুঁজিবাজারের মধ্যে ভারসাম্য আনতে হবে, তাতে বাজারে তারল্য সরবরাহ বাড়বে। পুঁজিবাজারের টেকসই প্রবৃদ্ধি নির্ভর করে একটি শক্তিশালী প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারী ভিত্তি তৈরির ওপর। তার জন্য জরুরি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড শিল্পের বিকাশ। পেশাদার তহবিল ব্যবস্থাপকদের মাধ্যমে পরিচালিত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে বাজারে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বিনিয়োগের সংস্কৃতিও তৈরি হবে। তাতে বাজারে অস্থিরতা কমবে; কিন্তু দুঃখজনকভাবে দেশের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড খাতটি এখনো প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে রয়েছে। ভারতের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার দেশটির জিডিপির প্রায় ২০ শতাংশ। সেখানে বাংলাদেশে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার জিডিপির মাত্র শূন্য দশমিক ২ শতাংশ। পুঁজিবাজারকে যদি মৌলিক ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করাতে হয়, তবে এই অনুপাত উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বাড়াতে হবে। এ জন্য প্রয়োজন লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিসহায়তা। মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে বিনিয়োগের কর রেয়াত সুবিধা ১৫ শতাংশ থেকে বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা, ৫ লাখ টাকা পর্যন্ত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের লভ্যাংশ আয়কে করমুক্ত রাখা এবং আইপিওতে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের কোটা বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা হলে তাতে খাতটি বড় হবে। এ ছাড়া বেমেয়াদি ও মেয়াদি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে ব্যাংকের বিনিয়োগের ওপর বিদ্যমান ১৫ শতাংশের সীমা তুলে নেওয়া প্রয়োজন। কারণ, এই সীমাবদ্ধতা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক পুঁজি বিনিয়োগকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করছে। যদি এই সংস্কারগুলো ধারাবাহিকভাবে বাস্তবায়ন করা যায়, তবে দেশের পুঁজিবাজারও দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধির একটি শক্তিশালী ভিতে পরিণত হবে। লেখক পরিচিতি: ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক ও প্রধান নির্বাহী, ভ্যানগার্ড অ্যাসেট ম্যানেজমেন্ট",

        "body": "কোভিডের সময় থেকেই বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতির গতি কমতে শুরু করে। এরপর রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধের জেরে তেলের দাম বেড়ে যাওয়া এবং ডলার–সংকটের কারণে অর্থনীতি আরেক দফা ধাক্কা খায়। এই বাস্তবতায় ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনের পর অর্থনীতি যখন স্থিতিশীল হতে শুরু করে, তখন গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের মধ্য দিয়ে সরকারের পতন হলো। দেশে ড. মুহাম্মদ ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকার গঠিত হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতিতে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে এখন কী করা দরকার, সে বিষয়ে আন্তর্জাতিক গণমাধ্যমগুলো বিভিন্ন ধরনের ব্যাখ্যা-বিশ্লেষণ দিচ্ছে। সেই সঙ্গে শেখ হাসিনার পতনের কারণসমূহও তুলে ধরছে গণমাধ্যমগুলো। তারা বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার মূল কারণ হিসেবে তরুণদের বেকারত্বকেই চিহ্নিত করেছে। এ ছাড়া কাঠামোগত বিভিন্ন চ্যালেঞ্জের কথাও জানিয়েছে তারা। নতুন সরকারের কী করণীয়, সে বিষয়েও বিদেশি গণমাধ্যমগুলো মোটামুটি একই সুরে কথা বলেছে। জার্মান সংবাদমাধ্যম ডয়চে ভেলের সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশে তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থানের মূল কারণ হলো বেকারত্ব। প্রতিবছর বিপুলসংখ্যক তরুণ কর্মবাজারে প্রবেশ করছেন; যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "City dwellers suffered for at least three and a half hours until 6:00pm on Sunday as different groups staged separate street protests and a road blockade in front of the Jatiya Press Club and its adjoining areas in the capital, mainly to press home their job-related demands, leading to huge traffic congestion in the area. Several groups, including the Independent Ebtedayee Madrasah Teachers’ Union, the teachers of schools for students with disabilities, and the United Non-MPO Unity Council began separate sit-in demonstrations near the press club in the morning. Traffic congestion began in the area at about 2:30pm when several thousand teachers, under the platform of the Independent Ebtedayee Madrassah Teachers’ Union, brought out a march towards the chief adviser’s residence Jamuna, and were intercepted by the police at Kadam Foara, after marching a few yards. Sunday was the 21st day of the continuous sit-in programme of the ebtedayee madrassah teachers in the National Press Club area. After facing the police barricade, the protesting madrassah teachers sat down, which ultimately blocked one side of the road. They have been demanding the immediate implementation of the government’s January 28 announcement that all approved independent ebtedayee madrasahs would be nationalised. Due to the blockade, traffic movement became standstill on both ends of the blockade point. As time passed, traffic congestion spread to the nearby areas, which affected several other areas, including Matshyabhaba, Shahbagh, Banglamotor, Paltan, Bijoy Sarani, Naya Paltan, Mouchak, Gulistan, and some other parts of Old Dhaka. The platform’s chairman, Mokhlesur Rahman, said that they withdrew their blockade from the road at about 6:00pm after a fruitful meeting with the education ministry officials. He, however, said that they would continue their movement until their demand was met. Meanwhile, several thousand teachers under the United Non-MPO Unity Council also staged a sit-in in front of the Press Club, demanding that the government bring all approved non-MPO educational institutions under MPO facilities. They also brought out a procession in the afternoon. The procession paraded nearby roads. Teachers and staff members of schools for disabled students, on the other hand, held a march towards the Bangladesh Secretariat in the afternoon, demanding recognition of their institutions and declaration of monthly pay order for them. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s deputy commissioner for media and public relations, Talebur Rahman, in a press release, said that simultaneous street protests by several groups disrupted traffic at different places in the capital. ‘These (the street protests) have disrupted traffic on several important roads, causing widespread public suffering and severe traffic congestion in some parts of the capital,’ he said. The police said that traffic movement became normal after 6:00pm.",

        "title": "Showpiece signals reflect Dhaka’s habit of superficial fixes",
        "body": "THE failure of automation attempts in Dhaka’s traffic management is both worrying and symptomatic of a broader inertia in urban governance. Despite repeated investments in automatic solutions, the city remains dependent on the manual traffic policing. The latest example is the automated traffic signalling system, launched only a month ago on a trial basis at seven crossings, which has already degenerated into a display without functional authority. Installed with the aim of reducing congestion and introducing predictability to road users, the signals now operate in parallel with manual direction, producing confusion rather than efficiency. Drivers still defer to police officers along Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, stretching across a strategic corridor from Shikkha Bhaban to the airport, even when lights turn green. This shows that technology has not translated into trust. Pedestrians, too, testify to their reluctance in relying on signals. The Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority insists that the system requires time for users to adjust to, yet such optimism appears thinly stretched when placed against earlier automation initiatives — countdown timers, digital boards, solar panels, remote controls and even so-called ‘intelligent’ systems — that have all lapsed into irrelevance. The present faltering of the trial signals cannot be read in isolation because it repeats a cycle in which automation is introduced with enthusiasm only to falter against the lived realities of Dhaka’s roads. Earlier initiatives promised to modernise traffic control but were eventually rendered ineffective by technical breakdowns, poor maintenance lack of integration and, above all, the absence of public trust. What is missing is not merely the hardware but a holistic approach that accounts for the behavioural patterns of drivers, the unpredictability of public demonstrations, the intensity of pedestrian flows and the institutional weaknesses of city authorities. Without addressing the fundamental challenges, the installation of further machines across the 22 crossings on this arterial corridor risks becoming another costly showpiece. A sustainable solution requires both engineering and sociology: sustained public education campaigns to familiarise citizens with signals, robust maintenance regimes to prevent collapse at the first breakdown, legal reinforcement so that drivers are compelled to comply and inter-agency coordination so that police, transport regulators and municipal bodies act in concert. Only when technology is embedded within such a systemic framework can automation hope to achieve credibility. Authorities should, therefore, treat the current trial not as an end in itself but as a starting point for comprehensive reform. Installing machines without ensuring behavioural change, enforcement and maintenance will only add to Dhaka’s long list of failed experiments. Automated signals should be integrated with strict compliance, sustained public education and institutional coordination. Only then can the city move beyond symbolic gestures and towards a credible system of traffic management that serves its citizens effectively.",

On Wednesday morning, a truck accident on the Langolbandh Bridge disrupted vehicle movement for a long time, leading to massive tailbacks. As a result, passenger buses, cargo trucks, and private vehicles remained stuck on the highway for hours until afternoon. Kanchpur Highway Police Station Officer-in-Charge Abdul Kader Jilani said the incident occurred around 10:30 am when a truck lost control on the Langolbandh Bridge and crashed into the bridge railing. The truck was carrying nearly 27 tonnes of goods, and the impact caused severe damage to the railing.He further said that because the truck was overloaded, it could not be removed with a wrecker. Authorities first had to unload the goods onto another truck, which took a long time. As a result, the wrecked truck could not be cleared before afternoon, causing a long traffic jam on the Chattogram-bound lane of the highway.",

        "title": "Over 6 lakh illegal rickshaws plying on city streets!",
        "body": "While Army, BDR and the police are frantically trying to control city traffic amid the Eid rush, thousands of unauthorised rickshaws and autorickshaws have taken to the city streets to make quick cash. City police officials said at present more than six lakh illegal rickshaws are plying on the city streets. At the same time, hundreds of autorickshaws from the city's peripheral townships have come to the city only to make the traffic situation worse, they added. Traffic police also blamed 'irresponsible motorists' for the worsening traffic congestion. They said most of the private cars found on the city streets carried only one or two passengers. The number of such 'luxury cars' rushing for the shopping centres are also increasing every day as the Eid nears. Most of the shopping centres do not have parking place and these are parked on the roads. A traffic department official advised the citizens to try to use public transports such as taxis, buses and such other vehicles as much as possible. The authorities now find themselves in a dilemma. They cannot decide whether to divert their limited manpower and resources to crack down on the illegal vehicles or to keep city arteries clear of the gridlock. In every shift, less than 400 traffic policemen are manning different points in the city. Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) officials, however, brushed aside the police claim of six lakh illegal rickshaws. They said in addition to 80,500 licensed rickshaws 'there are at the most three lakh illegal rickshaws on the city streets.' \"As in every year, this is the peak season for rickshawpullers,\" one official said. \"Thousands of rural people come to the city to pull rickshaws during this season and no rickshaws are lying idle in any garage,\" said a Revenue Department official of the DCC. Another official admitted that DCC did 'never' have any firm policy to control rickshaws although it is the sole authority for this. \"The DCC caught only a small number of rickshaws when the press started writing but all was mere white wash,\" said a DCC official. \"Every time a clamp down started, a section of rickshawpullers started demonstrating in front of the Nagar Bhaban and the operation was instantly stopped.\" In view of the present traffic situation, DCC has given a list of 100 illegal rickshaw makers in the city to the city police. Police sources said they were trying to control making of rickshaws but were unable to do it 'satisfactorily' due to manpower constraint. So far they caught 100 illegal rickshaws in the city. While rickshaws were apparently taking most of the blame for the gridlock, in most cases illegal autorickshaws were going unpunished. Apart from one or two points in the city, there is no check point for autorickshaws. Rajuk officials noted that with the rapid expansion of the city, adequate number of roads were not constructed. Plans for new roads remain shelved because no government implements those fearing that land acquisition at the prime city spots would make it unpopular. \"The volume of traffic in such a big city cannot be accommodated by the existing roads,\" said one official. DCC is also fighting a losing battle against different trade unions as many of them are running, \"a parallel authority and issuing illegal rickshaw licences against payment of fees,\" he added.",

On Wednesday morning, a truck accident on the Langolbandh Bridge disrupted vehicle movement for a long time, leading to massive tailbacks. As a result, passenger buses, cargo trucks, and private vehicles remained stuck on the highway for hours until afternoon. Kanchpur Highway Police Station Officer-in-Charge Abdul Kader Jilani said the incident occurred around 10:30 am when a truck lost control on the Langolbandh Bridge and crashed into the bridge railing. The truck was carrying nearly 27 tonnes of goods, and the impact caused severe damage to the railing.He further said that because the truck was overloaded, it could not be removed with a wrecker. Authorities first had to unload the goods onto another truck, which took a long time. As a result, the wrecked truck could not be cleared before afternoon, causing a long traffic jam on the Chattogram-bound lane of the highway.",

        "body": "THE Dhaka Central University that the government is working to establish to resolve the long-drawn problems of seven colleges affiliated, in the latest round, to the University of Dhaka appears to have been mired in ungrounded arguments that the students, even the ones still in higher secondary education, and teachers of the colleges have put up. Before the affiliation of the colleges to the University of Dhaka was cancelled in January 2025 with the students having been unwilling to continue with the university, the National University, an affiliating collegiate university founded in 1992, had governed them since. As the National University could not cope with a large number of students, the seven colleges were put back under the University of Dhaka in February 2017 keeping to a 2014 decision. As the long-drawn issue resurfaced towards the end of 2024, the government worked on a separate university named the Dhaka Central University with the admission for the 2023–24 and 2024–25 academic sessions to resolve the issues that the colleges — Begum Badrunnessa Government Girls’ College, Dhaka College, Eden Girls’ College, Government Bangla College, Government Shaheed Suhrawardy College, Government Titumir College and Kabi Nazrul Government College. With the progress having run further towards a meaningful resolution, the teachers of the seven colleges at protests on respective campuses. The government is working on the new university, with 35–40 per cent of the classes online. The remaining classes and examinations would be held in person. The proposed university will hold science faculty using the infrastructure of the Dhaka College, Eden Girls’ College and Badrunnessa Girls’ College after college hours. Humanities faculty classes will take place at the Government Bangla College, business faculty classes at Titumir College and law and justice faculty classes at Suhrawardy College and Kabi Nazrul College. The administrative building, a teacher-student centre, an auditorium and a health centre will be built on separate locations. The teachers, banded under the BCS General Education Association, put forth a set of 11 demands, which include the incorporation of general education cadre members in all administrative and teaching positions of the proposed university, no new department, no exclusion of any department that the colleges run, no change in the ownership of the college assets and the like. Whilst these are affairs for the proposed university, which would only use the college infrastructure, and its managers to decide, it appears that the college teachers and college students who are in their tertiary education or would step in there are confused about the structure and functioning of the university. The government must not, therefore, heed the ungrounded arguments and mar the process of the establishment of the Dhaka Central University. It must, rather, proceed with its plan as early as it can to resolve the long-standing problems of the students of the seven colleges.",

        "title": "Showpiece signals reflect Dhaka’s habit of superficial fixes",
        "body": "THE failure of automation attempts in Dhaka’s traffic management is both worrying and symptomatic of a broader inertia in urban governance. Despite repeated investments in automatic solutions, the city remains dependent on the manual traffic policing. The latest example is the automated traffic signalling system, launched only a month ago on a trial basis at seven crossings, which has already degenerated into a display without functional authority. Installed with the aim of reducing congestion and introducing predictability to road users, the signals now operate in parallel with manual direction, producing confusion rather than efficiency. Drivers still defer to police officers along Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, stretching across a strategic corridor from Shikkha Bhaban to the airport, even when lights turn green. This shows that technology has not translated into trust. Pedestrians, too, testify to their reluctance in relying on signals. The Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority insists that the system requires time for users to adjust to, yet such optimism appears thinly stretched when placed against earlier automation initiatives — countdown timers, digital boards, solar panels, remote controls and even so-called ‘intelligent’ systems — that have all lapsed into irrelevance. The present faltering of the trial signals cannot be read in isolation because it repeats a cycle in which automation is introduced with enthusiasm only to falter against the lived realities of Dhaka’s roads. Earlier initiatives promised to modernise traffic control but were eventually rendered ineffective by technical breakdowns, poor maintenance lack of integration and, above all, the absence of public trust. What is missing is not merely the hardware but a holistic approach that accounts for the behavioural patterns of drivers, the unpredictability of public demonstrations, the intensity of pedestrian flows and the institutional weaknesses of city authorities. Without addressing the fundamental challenges, the installation of further machines across the 22 crossings on this arterial corridor risks becoming another costly showpiece. A sustainable solution requires both engineering and sociology: sustained public education campaigns to familiarise citizens with signals, robust maintenance regimes to prevent collapse at the first breakdown, legal reinforcement so that drivers are compelled to comply and inter-agency coordination so that police, transport regulators and municipal bodies act in concert. Only when technology is embedded within such a systemic framework can automation hope to achieve credibility. Authorities should, therefore, treat the current trial not as an end in itself but as a starting point for comprehensive reform. Installing machines without ensuring behavioural change, enforcement and maintenance will only add to Dhaka’s long list of failed experiments. Automated signals should be integrated with strict compliance, sustained public education and institutional coordination. Only then can the city move beyond symbolic gestures and towards a credible system of traffic management that serves its citizens effectively.",

The city’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, posing serious health risks to residents, according to the Air Quality Index (AQI). India’s Delhi and Qatar’s Doha occupied the first and third spots on the list, with AQI scores of 330 and 230, respectively. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be ‘very unhealthy’, while a reading of 301+ is considered ‘hazardous’, posing serious health risks to residents. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues.
