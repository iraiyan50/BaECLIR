        "title": "Minimum standard of edn a must for MPO: Farruk",
        "body": "Education Minister Dr. Osman Farruk yesterday said Monthly Pay Order (MPO) and government grants to educational institutions must not be a \"permanent settlement\". \"The educational institutions that will fail to register a minimum performance should not have the right to claim government grants and facilities,\" he said while inaugurating as chief guest the national-level programme of the 'National Education Week-2003'. Held at the Osmani Memorial Hall under the auspices of the education ministry, the function was also addressed by State Minister for Education ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Deputy Minister Mohammad Abdus Salam Pinto as special guests. Presided over by Education Secretary Mohammad Shahidul Alam, the inaugural function was also addressed, among others, by Director General of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Directorate Abdur Rashid and Joint Secretary of the ministry Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. Dr. Osman Farruk said the education administration had become weak and full of irregularities and the managing committees almost \"non-functioning\" because of \"personal\" and \"coterie\" interests. \"Our government does not believe in politicisation of school and college managing committees,\" he said adding that to improve the prevailing situation, both responsibility and accountability of the governing bodies had to be enhanced. The education minister said the responsibility to improve the standard of education must be carried out jointly by its stakeholders -- teachers, students, guardians, civil society members and the government. The education minister said the curriculum as well as syllabus of the text books must be \"life-oriented\" and realistic so that real nation-building architects come out from the country's 107,000 educational institutions. The main work to attain this goal has to be carried out by 750,000 teachers employed in these institutions, he said. Turning to the quality education, the minister said \"We do not want to engage police to remove note books from the market, nor do we want to close down the private coaching centres right now.\" \"We have to go to the root of the problem and ask ourselves why students have become dependent on note books and coaching centres,\" he said, adding that teachers must perform their sacred jobs of imparting education and wisdom to their pupils in the class room for the full period of their contract hours before heading for coaching centres. \"We have to recast our education system so that the new generation can be injected with human and moral values and are well-educated,\" he said. He stressed the need for introducing an education system that is capable of achieving the basic objectives of education, like enlightening the learners, making them wise, knowledgeable and good citizens and capable of innovating new skills and strategies for nation-building purposes. Making a departure from his written speech, the education minister raised some important issues like adopting unfair means in examinations, misuse of funds and facilities, sufferings of the teachers in the corridors of education directorate and national university to get their problems addressed. At the same time, the minister hinted at some important measures his ministry is going to take to streamline this very important sector of national life. He said the education directorate and the national university would be further decentralised so that the teachers and others concerned could get their services without undergoing much hazard and inconvenience. The inaugural session was followed by National Education Conference entitled \"Education for Attaining Self-reliance\".",

        "title": "No edn reform commission reflects neglect: BNP",
        "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Abdul Moyeen Khan alleged that despite many reform commissions were formed in other sectors post uprising, none was set up for education, reflecting the interim government’s neglect of the sector. Having questioned the mindset that education reform was not necessary, the BNP standing committee member asked if the previous regime took education to its highest level, leaving no room for further improvement. His remarks came on Thursday at a discussion meeting organised by Nagarik Oikya at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the capital. Moyeen Khan at the time also said that the status of the teachers under the government’s Monthly Pay Order system was low and their treatment was also poor. He called ‘heart-rending’ and ‘shameful’ the recent use of tear gas and baton charge by the police to disperse the teachers demonstrating for pay rise and other facilities. Criticising the government for increasing the house rent allowance by only Tk 500, he questioned how teachers would be able to manage expenses with such paltry amounts. The event was chaired by Nagarik Oikya president Mahmudur Rahman Manna. Calling teachers the ‘makers of human beings’, Moyeen Khan said that no country could achieve prominence without a strong education system supported by dedicated teachers and students. If the public administration employees or the police received generous benefits, the same should be provided to teachers too, he said. Moyeen Khan further criticised the past 15 years of Awami League regime’s policy, alleging efforts to undermine education by devaluing teachers, destroying textbooks, and dismantling school and university courses. He reminded the meeting that the 2024 Anti-Discrimination Movement stemmed from the demand for fair opportunities in the public service jobs without any discrimination. He also observed that the main dissatisfaction arose from the appointment process through the Public Service Commission and questioned whether students were pursuing education for nation-building or merely for personal career advancement. Moyeen Khan also warned against the idea of an upper house for professionals who have not been elected by people. He said that while engineers, doctors and other highly qualified professionals played a crucial advisory role, they could not make decisions about the country’s governance without a public mandate. The BNP leader also said that professional people held an inherent urge for assuming control, which he stated as a form of ‘self-criticism’, stressing that in a democracy based on popular representation, governance decisions must be made by elected representatives.",

        "title": "Disasters disrupt education",
        "body": "Different natural and human-made disasters are adversely affecting the country’s education sector by lowering quality of education and damaging infrastructure of the educational institutions round the year, government data show. With the changes in intensity, frequency, duration and timing of the natural disasters in recent years due to climate change, students especially the girl ones are continuing to face challenges like dropout, early marriage, poor academic performance and trafficking. Researchers and academics said that the negative impacts on the education system were increasing due to a lack of inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination, the absence of pragmatic, actionable and implementable disaster management plans of the government and a huge gap in the implementation of policies. Changes in scheduling and management of schools and disaster management policies and increasing awareness and readiness among students and teachers have been suggested by them to reduce these harsh impacts. According to the Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024, between 2013 and 2024, due to cyclones, floods and tides, 32,013 primary- to tertiary-level government and non-government educational institutions were closed, 17,603 institutions were open but classes could not be held, 17,289 institutions saw trees around them dying, 17,289 institutions’ classrooms were damaged, 13,263 institutions’ playground became unusable, 7,436 institutions were used as shelters, 4,974 institutions saw curriculum not completed properly, 4,911 institutions’ toilet system were collapsed, 4,898 institutions’ water supply system were collapsed, 3,117 institutions’ connecting roads were completely damaged, 2,003 institutions’ hall rooms were damaged, and 178 institutions had to be relocated. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 has been published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics recently based on a countrywide survey. Professor emeritus Ainun Nishat, adviser for the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research at BRAC University, said that impacts of climate change were directly related to various natural disasters. ‘Intensity, frequency, duration and timing of each of the disasters are changing,’ he said, adding ‘and obviously these have impacts on the education system.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, founder of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, said that students especially the girl ones were severely affected by the natural and human-made disasters. During any prolonged closure of the educational institutions by disasters, girls faced different types of harassment due to lack of security, he said. ‘As per my evidence-based research, in border areas like at Domar (upazila), Nilphamari (district), Bhurungamari (an upazila in Rangpur district), Bhomra port (in Satkhira district) and in Jashore border girls were being trafficked due to poverty,’ Mokaddam said. He said that their parents were being assured that their girls would return once the schools would reopen. The parents also chose early marriages for their girls during disasters, he added. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 also showed that following different natural and human-made disasters, a total of 1,02,015 students, including 62,308, or 61.08 per cent, girl students, were dropped out in 2024. Out of the total dropouts, the highest 57,105 dropped out from the secondary level followed by 35,614 from colleges, 8,600 from madrasahs and 696 from the primary level. The preliminary findings of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2025 conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund recently, showed that the national rate of child marriage currently was 56 per cent. The BANBEIS’s 2024 report also showed that due to the impacts of disasters, the percentage of students having performance loss in different subjects, including Bangla, English, mathematics, science, sociology, accounting and religion was 1.11 per cent at the primary level, 77.72 per cent at the secondary level, 5.37 per cent at the college level and 15.8 per cent at the madrassahs in 2024. Meanwhile, the National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (2023‐2050), prepared by the environment, forest and climate change ministry for climate change adaptation, identified 14 disasters and 11 climate stress areas in Bangladesh. Referring to the disasters and climate stress areas, climate change specialist Ainun Nishat said that the authorities had to develop an understanding how these were impacting the education system. First, he said, there will be more intensified and prolonged heat waves but all classrooms cannot be made air-conditioned. He recalled that in the 50s, 60s and 70s, the primary school classes were held between 7:00am and 10:00am or 11:00am to avoid the hottest time of the day. The timing of the rainy season is changing also, which is closely connected with the crop planting and male students as they have to help their parents on fields, Ainun said. Cyclones usually happen in eight weeks from March 15 to May 15 or October 15 to December 15, he said. During the cyclones and floods, people take shelter in the educational institutions and nobody wants to leave the shelters quickly after the disasters, he said. ‘The intensities of disasters are changing and there has to be policy change regarding school hours,’ he said. Ainun said that the environment ministry was carrying out the national adaptation plan without coordinating with the education ministry. ‘Every ministry will be affected by disasters,’ he said, adding, ‘in our country inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination is very poor.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, who was a member of the NAP feasibility committee, said that during the cyclones and floods, educational institutions were not only damaged but also used as shelters, which caused dislocation and prolonged closure of these institutions. He mentioned that two years ago during a flash flood, 94 per cent of areas in Sunamganj and 90 per cent areas in Sylhet were gone under water for 40 to 45 days. ‘For the past four decades, these educational institutions remained in this fragile state and unfortunately we are not getting out of this situation,’ he said. The prolonged closure of these institutions also affected students physically and mentally, he said, adding that due to the discontinuity of education, many students dropped out in an increasing rate. Mokaddam said that there were some sort and immediate rehabilitation initiatives but no pragmatic, actionable and implementable short-, middle- and long-term plans for disaster management. About the existing plans, he said, ‘There is a huge gap in implementing these.’ He said that during the earthquakes in Dhaka in November, some of the traumatised Dhaka University students jumped from buildings and got injured. ‘There should be awareness and readiness among the students and teachers,’ he said. He termed fire incidents, road accidents, discrimination in education and waterlogging in urban areas human-made disasters. There are 1,50,007 primary- to tertiary-level educational institutions (primary schools, junior secondary schools, secondary schools, school section of the secondary school, colleges and madrassahs) in the country.",

        "title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise",
        "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

        "title": "AI will soon force Bangladesh to rethink how students learn",
        "body": "Imagine a dedicated science teacher in a classroom in Dhaka, posing a thoughtful question to his students. \"Think about this overnight,\" he says. \"Whoever can reason through it tomorrow will have achieved something truly their own.\" It is a noble gesture — a small ritual of intellectual cultivation designed to challenge young minds, connect them, and ultimately help them understand the world around them. In a different world, the next day would see a handful of students with tentative answers — the fruits of their mental labour. But in our world, tomorrow promises a very different outcome. The teacher will be met not with the hesitant hands of thinkers, but with a chorus of perfectly recited, analytically sound answers. For the night, the challenge was not wrestled with in the quiet of a student's mind; it was delegated. The question was fed into an AI model, which promptly returned the cognitive labour — pre-packaged and flawless — bypassing the very process the teacher hoped to inspire. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel The sacred contract between teacher and student — the promise that effort leads to understanding — is being broken not by malice, but by a tool of irresistible convenience. The very exercises meant to build strong, independent minds are now being completed by an artificial brain. How widespread is AI access? There is no exact data on how many students from post-primary to university level (class 6 to 12) are using AI. According to Education Statistics 2023, the total number of students in post-primary education, including secondary school education (8,166,188), school and college (1,609,738), and college education (4,631,126), amounts to roughly 1.44 crore, excluding English-medium institutions. Approximately 50% of the national population has internet access; however, not all students can utilise it effectively. If we conservatively assume that around 40% of these students have some level of access to AI tools, that gives us an approximate figure of 50-60 lakh students who could already be using AI for their studies. This leads to an apparent inequality. Students in urban areas with internet-enabled devices can rely on AI for quick answers, while a large proportion, perhaps 70%, still flip through guidebooks or struggle to make sense of creative questions without such assistance. In other words, AI has quietly created a new form of educational privilege. The illusion of learning When the creative question system was introduced in Bangladeshi schools around 2010, it was hailed as a revolutionary step. The idea was simple but powerful: move away from rote memorisation and encourage students to think critically. It was designed to nurture reasoning, analysis, and imagination. And for some years, teachers reported that students became more curious, asking \"why\" rather than just \"what.\" That assumption is now not just outdated; it is a fantasy. The genie of Generative AI is out of the bottle, and it answers \"why\" faster than any student ever could. For students, AI feels like magic. A complex math problem? Photomath solves it with a step-by-step breakdown in seconds. An essay on climate change? Written in perfect English by Claude.ai. Even Bangla literature's creative questions can be answered instantly. But this convenience is a trap. We are witnessing the great outsourcing of the thinking process itself. The student is no longer a thinker but a prompt manager, a middleman between the exam paper and the AI. The \"creative\" in the creative question now risks standing for \"creatively prompting an AI.\" The illusion of learning is complete when the student believes the answer is theirs, even though the process of arriving at it was entirely external. Rethinking the entire system The bigger issue is that our exam system assumes only the student's brain is available during preparation. That assumption is now outdated. Our learning and exam system is designed for a pre-AI world. Creative questions no longer guarantee creative answers. AI generates them instantly, often surpassing the work of most students under exam pressure. This creates an apparent mismatch. Exams are meant to measure a student's critical thinking skills, but they often end up reflecting who has access to the internet or who can craft the most effective AI prompt. Education risks shifting from personal growth to digital shortcuts. Of course, some might argue that students have always had access to guidebooks or private tutors. But even when consulting multiple books, notes, or a tutor, the student's brain was actively working through the problem. Today, with AI, that cognitive effort is partially or even entirely outsourced, leaving little room for genuine intellectual development. The future of learning starts now Using AI detection tools or forbidding students from using AI in education is no longer a viable solution. The real challenge lies in adapting our teaching and assessment systems to meet the demands of this new reality. In Bangladesh, this means rethinking how we teach and evaluate students, and how we prepare both learners and educators for an AI-integrated future. Examinations must evolve to focus on skills that emphasise reasoning, analysis, and creativity, qualities that AI cannot easily replicate. Instead of relying on rote memorisation or predictable written answers, assessments should include oral exams, spontaneous essays written in class, and collaborative presentations. These formats make it harder to rely solely on AI-generated content and encourage genuine understanding, reflection, and intellectual ownership.

        "body": "Language is not just a tool for communication—it is a powerful means of building confidence. Whether it's applying for jobs, studying abroad, attending office meetings, or navigating social situations, proficiency in English has become increasingly essential. Against this backdrop, the globally acclaimed and award-winning English learning app, ELSA Speak, has officially launched in Bangladesh. This AI-powered language learning solution not only simplifies the learning process but also boosts user confidence significantly.\n\nA special event was held on July 25 at The Westin Dhaka to celebrate the official launch of ELSA Speak in Bangladesh. The event was graced by senior government officials, international guests, academics, corporate representatives, and leaders from the local technology and education sectors.\n\nHigh-resolution screenshots, brand guidelines, and demo videos were presented at the event to better showcase the collaborative effort of technology and language education.\n\nThe Bangladesh launch of ELSA Speak has been made possible through the initiative of Bacbon Limited, a leading international ISO-certified ed-tech organization that has been working in Bangladesh’s large-scale education sector since 2013. Bacbon has extended its footprint beyond Bangladesh to countries like Japan, the USA, UK, South Korea, and various Middle Eastern nations, offering affordable digital education and smart learning solutions. The organization delivers comprehensive 360-degree educational solutions and has been actively involved in projects with renowned international agencies such as the World Bank, UNDP, USAID, ADB, and JICA.\n\nELSA Speak is an international app that began its journey in Silicon Valley, USA in 2015 and now boasts over 80 million users across 190+ countries. The app uses advanced AI technology to help users improve pronunciation, fluency, and spoken English confidence. With its cutting-edge speech recognition system, ELSA listens to users’ speech and provides instant feedback, enabling them to learn correct pronunciation and natural speaking rhythms.\n\nThe chief guest at the launch event was Md Mahbub-Ul-Alam, Secretary of the Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nWill Polese, Vice President of Revenue at ELSA Corporation, was present to sign the partnership agreement and deliver insights into how ELSA works. Representing Bacbon Limited were Chairman & Managing Director Abdul Matin Sheikh Mahin, Executive Director Arif Ullah Khan, and Director of Human Resources Aminur Rahman.\n\nWill Polese elaborated on how ELSA identifies individual weaknesses and creates personalized learning plans tailored to each user. He emphasized that this feature differentiates ELSA from any other English learning app on the market. Globally, millions use ELSA to enhance their English skills—especially those seeking international employment, higher education, or work in English-speaking environments.\n\nAbdul Matin Sheikh Mahin, Chairman of Bacbon Limited, stated that the organization has long worked to empower students with digital education. Through the partnership with ELSA, a modern AI-based English learning platform has now been introduced in Bangladesh. He believes that this app will become a valuable tool for the country’s youth.\n\nAt the event, Imran Hossain, a successful ELSA user who scored 7.5 in IELTS, shared his experience. He explained how using ELSA in his daily routine greatly improved his pronunciation and confidence. He particularly praised the app’s feedback system and variety of practice exercises.\n\nAn English teacher also shared her experience, stating that ELSA helped her significantly in enhancing her teaching capabilities and language skills.

        "title": "Showpiece signals reflect Dhaka’s habit of superficial fixes",
        "body": "THE failure of automation attempts in Dhaka’s traffic management is both worrying and symptomatic of a broader inertia in urban governance. Despite repeated investments in automatic solutions, the city remains dependent on the manual traffic policing. The latest example is the automated traffic signalling system, launched only a month ago on a trial basis at seven crossings, which has already degenerated into a display without functional authority. Installed with the aim of reducing congestion and introducing predictability to road users, the signals now operate in parallel with manual direction, producing confusion rather than efficiency. Drivers still defer to police officers along Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, stretching across a strategic corridor from Shikkha Bhaban to the airport, even when lights turn green. This shows that technology has not translated into trust. Pedestrians, too, testify to their reluctance in relying on signals. The Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority insists that the system requires time for users to adjust to, yet such optimism appears thinly stretched when placed against earlier automation initiatives — countdown timers, digital boards, solar panels, remote controls and even so-called ‘intelligent’ systems — that have all lapsed into irrelevance. The present faltering of the trial signals cannot be read in isolation because it repeats a cycle in which automation is introduced with enthusiasm only to falter against the lived realities of Dhaka’s roads. Earlier initiatives promised to modernise traffic control but were eventually rendered ineffective by technical breakdowns, poor maintenance lack of integration and, above all, the absence of public trust. What is missing is not merely the hardware but a holistic approach that accounts for the behavioural patterns of drivers, the unpredictability of public demonstrations, the intensity of pedestrian flows and the institutional weaknesses of city authorities. Without addressing the fundamental challenges, the installation of further machines across the 22 crossings on this arterial corridor risks becoming another costly showpiece. A sustainable solution requires both engineering and sociology: sustained public education campaigns to familiarise citizens with signals, robust maintenance regimes to prevent collapse at the first breakdown, legal reinforcement so that drivers are compelled to comply and inter-agency coordination so that police, transport regulators and municipal bodies act in concert. Only when technology is embedded within such a systemic framework can automation hope to achieve credibility. Authorities should, therefore, treat the current trial not as an end in itself but as a starting point for comprehensive reform. Installing machines without ensuring behavioural change, enforcement and maintenance will only add to Dhaka’s long list of failed experiments. Automated signals should be integrated with strict compliance, sustained public education and institutional coordination. Only then can the city move beyond symbolic gestures and towards a credible system of traffic management that serves its citizens effectively.",

        "title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise",
        "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

        "body": "Farmers of the country cannot be benefited under the conventional agricultural marketing system here, according to experts. It is necessary to devise innovative strategies and implement a fair distribution policy alongside online marketing for the wellbeing of farmers, they said. Speakers said this at a virtual seminar styled \"Digital marketing under pandemic situation: Present and aftermath\" organised by Dhaka School of Economics (DScE), a constituent institution of Dhaka University, on Saturday. Professors and educationists from various countries, including the United States, Canada, Thailand, India, Australia, and Bangladesh, addressed the online seminar, which was held in three sessions. Besides, chief executives of different corporate sectors and entrepreneurs also spoke at the webinar. Around 70 experts and students from six countries took part in the event. Professor Dr Muhammad Mahboob Ali, progremme coordinator of the entrepreneurship economics department of the DScE presided over the programme, while Chairman of the DScE Governing Council and Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad was present as the session chair. Dr Kholiquzzaman said the distribution system must be ensured up to the grassroots level during the coronavirus situation. New strategies have to be adapted to reach products and benefits there, he added. Dr Muhammad Mahboob Ali pointed out that restrictions on sacrificing animals at homesteads and slum areas during the forthcoming Eid-ul-Adha might affect the demand for sacrificial animals, causing farmers to face losses. He, therefore, stressed bringing changes to the management system alongside reforming the marketing and distribution to ensure benefit for cattle farmers during the current pandemic situation. Dr Vichayanan Rattanawiboonsom, dean of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Communications at Naresuan University of Thailand, attended a technical session of the webinar as the chief guest. Besides, Professor Dr Kripa Shankar Gupta, director of KSG Centre for Quality Minds, and Taslim Ahmed, distribution and management strategist based in Canada, presented papers in the session. Among others, Helal Ahmed Chowdhury, professor at the BIBM and former managing director of Pubali Bank; Md Zahir Uddin Arif, professor of marketing department at Jagannath University; Dr Md Sabur Khan, chairman of Daffodil Group; and Anis A Khan, former managing director and CEO of Mutual Trust Bank participated in the webinar.

        "title": "The astounding triumph of tobacco harm reduction in Sweden",
        "body": "If there were any lingering doubts about the effectiveness of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) policies in ushering a country into a smoke-free era, Sweden has unequivocally silenced them with its recent and remarkable success. In a resounding testament to their unwavering commitment to public health, Sweden is on the verge of becoming the first smoke-free nation in Europe, surpassing the European Union's target date by an astounding 17 years.\n\nAccording to the European Network for Smoking and Tobacco Prevention (ENSP) and the World Health Organization (WHO), a country earns the coveted “smoke-free” status when the percentage of adult smokers dwindles below 5% of the population. In 2023, Sweden is set to achieve this momentous milestone, thanks to a comprehensive and visionary approach that has seen the number of smokers plummet from 15% to an impressive 5.6% over the past 15 years.\n\nCentral to Sweden's extraordinary achievement is the government's ground-breaking initiative of reducing taxes and excise on Harm Reduction (HR) products, including snus, vapes, e-cigarettes, HTPs, and more. A revolutionary study titled “The Swedish Experience: A Roadmap to a Smoke-free Society,” authored by esteemed figures in the field such as Prof Karl Fagerstrom, recipient of the distinguished “WHO Medal” in 1999 for his contributions to tobacco control, Dr Delon Human, former advisor to the UN Secretary-General and three Directors-General of WHO, and Anders Milton, former president of the World Medical Association and Chairman of The Snus Commission in Sweden, sheds light on Sweden's journey towards this remarkable accomplishment.\n\nPresented during a seminar on March 14, the study highlights the profound impact that Sweden's strategies could have if adopted by other European Union member states. The potential to save an astonishing 3.5 million lives in Europe alone emerges as a compelling incentive to follow in Sweden's footsteps. At the heart of Sweden's approach lies a clear emphasis on harm reduction tools, which are regarded as less detrimental to health and instrumental in aiding individuals in their quest to break free from smoking addiction. To facilitate this, the Swedish government has implemented taxes on such products that range from 8% to 36% of the excise imposed on traditional cigarettes.\n\nMikael Damberg, the Finance Minister of Sweden, explains that the nation's tobacco and nicotine tax structure has been meticulously designed to reflect the varying levels of risks associated with different products. Consequently, items deemed more harmful carry higher taxes, while the prices of vapes, snus, HTPs, and other alternatives have been significantly reduced, rendering them more accessible to adult consumers seeking an escape from the clutches of smoking.\n\nSweden's innovative model seamlessly weaves together the recommendations set forth in the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, encompassing measures aimed at curbing the supply and demand of tobacco. However, what sets Sweden apart is its embracing of smoke-free products as viable alternatives that are less harmful. By acknowledging the substantial harm reduction potential of products such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches, Sweden encourages smokers to make the switch, recognizing that this transition offers a far superior option to persisting with conventional smoking habits.\n\nSweden's resounding success with tobacco harm reduction policies stands as an inspiring example, resonating far beyond its borders. With an unwavering dedication to the well-being of its citizens, Sweden has charted a transformative path towards a smoke-free society, poised to redefine the standards of public health achievements",

        "title": "Rights to education and health",
        "body": "Globally, it is recognised that ‘educating children’ gives the next generation the most effective tools to fight poverty, prevent diseases, build resilience and create a progressive and peaceful society as ‘good health and well-being for all’ is the foundation of sustainable development. So, to protect and promote the universal rights to education and health are requisites for all aspects of social and economic development. Two articles, 17 and 28, of the constitution entrench universal rights to education, especially free primary education, as well as rights to freedom of choice to get the higher education keeping to everyone’s potential and merit. Article 18 (1) highlights the state’s primary duty to raise the nutrition level and to improve the public health. So, the constitutional mandate and the given commitment to the several international conventions such as United Nations’ Convention on Child Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights oblige obligate Bangladesh to ensure free access to quality education and improved health services. Despite being the basic human right, the constitution does not recognise the health right as the universal human rights. The global development framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, commits to leaving no one behind, which is a great premise to working together with international development partners to provide quality education and health services for all. What is the ground reality in both sectors: education and health? National statistics show that 40.72 per cent of children and youths are out of education because of multifaceted causes as well as the maternal and under-five child mortality rates are 163 per 100,000 live births (maternal mortality) and 30.6 deaths under 1000 live births (under-five mortality) respectively. This clearly indicates the state could not protect the education and health rights as the universal human rights. In addition, 51.4 per cent of girl children are married off they reach 18 and 11.3 per cent of children are engaged in labour. This is also a gross violation of children’s rights to development with their full potential. The disparities between rural and urban education and health services in terms of access to and the quality of services are unimaginable. The people in several poverty pockets such as delta, coastal and haor areas do not have minimum level of access to health care services and to quality education. There are union health complexes and government primary schools, but they are almost completely dysfunctional for lack of resources, isolation, negligence of the national and local government authorities, overlooking and exclusionary approach and the frame of mind of the political and community leaders, prevailing rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability and people’s ignorance and lack of voice for their rights and entitlement. However, only in some big cities, particularly in the capital city, a very few education and health facilities and institutions provide acceptable standards of health and education services. But that are expensive and completely out of reach of ordinary people. Only the affluent group of people, about 10 per cent of the population, can afford this good quality of health and education services. And, almost 90 per cent of the population and all of rural and marginalised people, who are penniless and powerless, receive education and health services from the dysfunctional and retrospective facilities and systems. As a result, not only individuals face the adverse impact of the dysfunctional health and education services, but also national development also suffers in all aspects. The health and education services have completely been turned into business through the hegemonic political systems and monopoly and manipulative business approaches. Good quality of education and health service systems are the main engines of all kinds of development, economic and social. But keeping the majority portion of the population out of the quality services, a country cannot get on the development highway. Research shows that one dollar’s investment in education and health sectors generates more than one dollar’s return; but in all other sectors, it creates less than one dollar’s return. It proves that the rates of returns on investment in education and health sectors are much higher than that of another sectors. The good quality of education and health services is also the most effective tools to achieve the sustainable development, including poverty alleviation and building resilience of individual, community and systems to climate change, natural and artificial shocks and disasters. Definitely, the constraint of resources — financial and expertise — is a challenge to provide good quality of education and health services as the national budget allocation is much less than what is required. Along with this limited resource allocation, rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability, political engagement of professionals, monopoly business approaches, denial of human rights and the lack of the rule of law destroy the education and health systems. A comprehensive, rights-based-approach is required to enable both parties, service recipients and providers, as rights holders and legal and moral duty bearers respectively so that they can effectively perform their duties in all kinds of businesses and services. The marginalised and excluded section of the population as rights holders need to be able enough to receive technical and non-technical supports to claim their rights and entitlement accordingly. A rights-based approach is complementary with humanitarian and democratic norms, the rule of law, transparency and accountability and it impacts well-being, progress and prosperity. It is imperative to create such an inclusive, integrated and rights-based business environment and platforms that help to attain the expected outcomes, promoting ethical business standards with humanity and prohibiting unethical and illegal business that only makes money. So, improvement in the quality of education and health services requires some important policy and strategic actions. Demonstrating strategic, visionary and people-centric leadership would dismantle the hegemonic myths, bringing all actors together to the playground with the highest standard of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Business syndicates of rights-based services systems over the monopoly and manipulative business systems in education and health sectors should be eliminated. Primary and essential health care and services must be free for all people and specialised health services must be affordable for the rural poor and marginalised people with an equitable access to good public health. Physicians must stay in community and union health complexes and provide specialised health services for rural people. Public and private partnership should be attempted at to address the challenges of resources constraints. The marginalised and excluded groups should be empowered to protect their rights to quality services. The government implements social safety net programmes to support the extreme poor and people with disabilities, but that is not effective because of political bias, corruption, abuse, exploitation and exclusion. Rights-based, service-oriented education and health systems should be established. It is essential to raise the floors of the extreme poor and marginalised people with education and empowerment programmes and initiatives so that they can raise their voice for their rights and entitlement. It is imperative that Bangladesh now should implement a comprehensive reform initiative, but no reforms will sustain in the long run if the reforms do not focus on education and health systems.

        "body": "As international education continues to attract thousands of Bangladeshi students each year, the demand for transparent, ethical, and reliable guidance has never been higher. Responding to this need is MMS Global Services, a study-abroad consultancy founded byMahmood Moosa Syed, which has steadily built a reputation for trust, honesty, and consistent student success.\n\nOver the years, MMS Global Services has positioned itself as a student-focused organization, helping applicants pursue higher education in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Sweden, and several European countries. What sets the firm apart, according to students and parents alike, is its clear communication, transparent processes, and realistic guidance throughout the application journey.\n\nMMS Global Services recently strengthened its approach by introducing a comprehensive “Study Abroad Roadmap”—a structured framework that guides students from initial assessment to post-arrival support. This model includes profile evaluation, course and university selection, documentation, visa preparation, pre-departure orientation, and career-focused guidance after arrival.\n\n“Many students fail not because they are unqualified, but because they receive incomplete or misleading information,” saidMahmood Moosa Syed, Founder of MMS Global Services. “We believe transparency is essential. Students deserve to know what is realistically achievable based on their profile, finances, and long-term goals.”\n\nAccording to the company, MMS Global Services maintains one of the highest student visa success rates in Bangladesh, a result it attributes to careful screening, honest counseling, and detailed documentation support. Rather than pushing students toward unsuitable destinations or institutions, consultants focus on aligning applications with genuine academic and financial readiness.\n\nThis approach has earned strong trust among students. Many describe the organization as honest, responsive, and supportive, particularly during critical stages such as SOP preparation, financial documentation, and visa interview readiness.\n\nA parent of a current international student shared that their child is now completing a master’s degree in Toronto, noting that MMS Global Services provided clear guidance at every step—from visa filing to accommodation planning—without hidden conditions or unrealistic promises.\n\nBeyond mainstream destinations, MMS Global Services has developed a strong footprint in Sweden and the United States, alongside several European countries—regions known for their strict visa scrutiny and detailed compliance requirements. The consultancy reports exceptionally high student visa success rates for Sweden and the USA, positioning it among the most trusted study-abroad consultancies in Bangladesh for these destinations.\n\nFor Sweden, where financial documentation and academic alignment play a critical role, MMS Global Services has earned a reputation for precise application handling and compliance-focused counseling. Similarly, for the United States, the firm provides in-depth guidance on university selection, SOP development, financial documentation, and visa interview preparation—areas where many applicants typically face challenges.\n\nStudents applying to European and US institutions receive destination-specific counseling, covering academic prerequisites, English proficiency standards, financial proof, visa interview readiness, and long-term career considerations. This structured and honest approach has helped many students secure successful outcomes in highly competitive education systems.\n\nWhile MMS Global Services operates from Bangladesh, its reach extends nationwide through online consultation and digital assessment services. Students can submit their profiles through the official website,mmsglobal.io, to receive free initial assessments and personalized guidance. The platform also publishes regular updates on admission timelines, document checklists, and scholarship opportunities.\n\nAs part of its digital expansion, MMS Global Services is currently working on a dedicated mobile application aimed at simplifying the study-abroad process for students. The upcoming app will allow users to track application progress, upload documents, receive real-time updates, and communicate directly with assigned counselors.\n\nAccording to the company, the app is being designed to improve transparency and accessibility, particularly for students outside major cities, ensuring they stay informed at every stage of their journey.\n\nTo further strengthen student support abroad, MMS Global Services is planning to introduce country-wise representatives in key destination countries. These representatives will assist students with local orientation, compliance guidance, and settlement-related challenges after arrival.\n\nFounder Mahmood Moosa Syed noted that this initiative aims to bridge the gap between admission and real-world adjustment. “Our responsibility doesn’t end with visa approval,” he said. “We want students to feel supported even after they reach their destination.”\n\nAs part of its future roadmap,MMS Global Servicesplans to organize study-abroad seminars across universities and colleges and launch a digital publication titled the “Global Scholarship Guide,” aimed at helping merit-based students better understand international funding opportunities.\n\nFor founder Mahmood Moosa Syed, the company’s long-term vision remains grounded in ethics and student success.\n\n“Studying abroad changes lives,” he said. “Our responsibility is to guide students honestly, transparently, and professionally—so they can build their future with confidence.”",

        "title": "Experts: Tobacco Harm Reduction framework necessary to achieve PM’s smoke-free vision by 2040",
        "body": "International health experts speaking at a harm reduction summit held today, discussed the need to regulate less harmful alternatives of nicotine delivery in a risk-proportionate manner while urging authorities for stricter restrictions on traditional cigarettes. Notable public health experts, policymakers, and media personnel gathered at the Bangladesh THR Summit 2023 on May 27, 2023, to discuss the role of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) in achieving the Honourable Prime Minister's vision of a ‘Smoke-free Bangladesh' by 2040.\n\nTHR is a public health strategy to reduce or minimize the health risks to individuals and wider society associated with the use of conventional tobacco products. THR amplifies the value of smoking cessation, but where smokers are unwilling or unable to quit, the use of innovative smoke free technologies, that deliver nicotine without the harmful bits -- smoke or tar. These are also referred to as Reduced Risk Products or RRPs including the likes of vaping devices, oral nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products and other non-combustible alternatives of nicotine delivery. Currently, the UK, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and many other progressive nations of the world are encouraging the use of such products to reduce smoking incidence by regulating them through a risk-proportionate regulatory framework.\n\nModerated by Dr  Delon Human, the event featured globally renowned public health experts such as Dr Derek Yach, Prof  Mihaela Raescu, Dr Kgosi Letlape, Dr Marewa Glover, Prof Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, and other experts such as Michael Landl, Masud-Uz-Zaman, Federico Fernandez with representation in the audience from ministries of industries, finance, commerce, home affairs, and other institutions such as Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA).\n\nWhile delivering his keynote speech, Dr Derek Yach, former WHO Cabinet Director and the person who co-led the development of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) said: “Harm reduction strategies have always been part of the FCTC and tobacco control, but thus far not fully implemented. Bangladesh has the opportunity to translate its economic transformation into accelerating tobacco control through harm reduction. It will save lives.”\n\nDr Delon Human, a former secretary general of World Medical Association and an adviser on global public health strategies to three Directors-General of the WHO and to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, expressed his concerns at the event: “The fundamental principle of public health is to prevent and control disease and premature death. With traditional tobacco control, there is little to no hope to achieve the aim of a smoke free world by 2040. Frankly, this is a death sentence for the almost 1.4 billion current smokers in the world, which include 20 million kind citizens of Bangladesh. How can this message of doom be turned into one of hope? By fully integrating harm reduction policies, science and regulated products into tobacco control.”\n\nDuring her panel session, Dr Marewa Glover, a New Zealand public health academic specialising in smoking cessation opined, “The poor and indigenous people in most countries suffer disproportionately from high smoking rates and tobacco-related disease. All stakeholders need to work together to improve access to smoking cessation services, including smoke-free nicotine alternatives, as has been done in New Zealand, through vaping products.”\n\nProf Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, a Greek cardiologist and the most cited THR researcher in the world suggested, “The evidence is clear, smoke free nicotine alternatives such as vaping products are at least 95% less harmful than cigarettes and the preferred method of quitting for most smokers. Along with oral nicotine pouches, these are gateway products out of smoking and should be made available in Bangladesh within well monitored, risk-proportionate regulatory frameworks.”\n\nFormer president of the World Medical Association and founder of Africa Medical Association, Dr Kgosi Letlape emphasized on ensuring access to harm reduction tools as basic human rights and highlighted the role of health professionals in contributing to the goal. He said, “Consumers have a human right to receive accurate health information and risk communication. Prohibition has never worked in public health. Rather empower consumers and patients with the truth and accurate risk assessments of products. Help them migrate from more to less harmful products, if they can't quit. It is the ethical duty of health professionals to assist consumers in this journey, to help prevent tobacco-related disease and save lives.”\n\nWith a practical THR framework in place, Bangladesh too, can become a global role model by achieving the Honourable Prime Minister's vision of a Smoke-Free Bangladesh by 2040",

        "body": "দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলে বাংলাদেশ জামায়াতে ইসলামীর সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল অধ্যাপক মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেছেন, শুধু সেক্যুলার শিক্ষা মানুষকে নৈতিক চরিত্র দিতে পারে না, বরং ইসলামের সুশিক্ষা ছাড়া এমন শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা ‘পশু তৈরি করছে, মানুষ নয়’, যার প্রমাণ আবরারের নির্মম হত্যা। সোমবার (৬ অক্টোবর) জাতীয় প্রেস ক্লাবের আব্দুস সালাম হলে শহীদ আবরার ফাহাদ দিবস উপলক্ষ্যে জাতীয় গণতান্ত্রিক পার্টি (জাগপা) আয়োজিত ‘রুখে দাঁড়াও ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ’ শীর্ষক এক আলোচনা সভায় প্রধান বক্তা হিসেবে তিনি এসব কথা বলেন। আলোচনা সভায় সভাপতিত্ব করেন জাগপার সহ সভাপতি ও দলীয় মুখপাত্র রাশেদ প্রধান। মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, আবরার ফাহাদ কোনো ছাত্রসংগঠনের সঙ্গে যুক্ত ছিল না, সে ছিল একজন দেশপ্রেমিক মেধাবী ছাত্র। তিস্তার পানি, ফেনী নদী, গ্যাস এবং কলকাতার বন্দরের ইতিহাস নিয়ে ফেসবুকে ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে লেখালেখি করায় বুয়েট ছাত্রলীগের নেতাকর্মীরা তাকে নির্মমভাবে পিটিয়ে হত্যা করে। তিনি বলেন, সেরা বিদ্যাপীঠের মেধাবী ছাত্ররা এমন নৃশংস কাজ করতে পারে কীভাবে? এটি প্রমাণ করে তাদের মেধা, মনন, শিক্ষা ও চরিত্রে মানবতা নেই। জামায়াতের সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল বলেন, এখন আধিপত্যবাদ মানে শুধু ভৌগোলিক সীমানা বা দেশ দখল নয়। বরং এটি হলো এক দেশ অন্য দেশে বসে ‘রিমোট কন্ট্রোলের’ মাধ্যমে শাসক বসানো, রাজনীতি, অর্থনীতি, বাজার, পররাষ্ট্রনীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা। এ কারণেই বাংলাদেশ তিস্তা নদীর পানি পাচ্ছে না এবং নানাভাবে শোষিত হচ্ছে। দেশের বর্তমান রাজনৈতিক পরিস্থিতি ও আসন্ন নির্বাচন প্রসঙ্গে মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, জনগণের আকাঙ্ক্ষা পূরণের জন্য একটি নির্দলীয় অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের অধীনে অবাধ ও সুষ্ঠু নির্বাচন দরকার। বিদ্যমান রাষ্ট্র কাঠামোকে বদলে দিয়ে রাজনৈতিক ও সাংবিধানিক সংস্কারের মাধ্যমে নতুন একটি রাষ্ট্র কাঠামো গঠন করতে হবে। এ সংস্কারের মধ্য দিয়ে এমন একটি রাষ্ট্রযন্ত্র তৈরি হবে, যেখানে নতুন করে আর কোনো ফ্যাসিস্ট কিংবা হাসিনার জন্ম হবে না। তিনি বলেন, আসন্ন নির্বাচনে ইসলামী শক্তি ও দেশপ্রেমিক শক্তির মধ্যে যে সমঝোতার সম্ভাবনা দেখা দিয়েছে, কোনো আধিপত্যবাদী শক্তি যেন সেই ঐক্যের পথে বাধা সৃষ্টি না করতে পারে। পাশাপাশি ভারতের সঙ্গে সমতার ভিত্তিতে ও ন্যায্যতার মাধ্যমে সুসম্পর্ক বজায় রাখার ব্যবস্থা করতে হবে।",

We don’t want to impose fresh shutdowns,” she said while speaking to the media on Saturday.\n\n“We want all the students to come back to school vaccinated, which is why we are prioritising their inoculation,” added Dipu Moni.\n\nExpressing concern at the rapid surge in Covid-19 infections, the minister urged everyone to be more aware and adhere to health guidelines for the sake of the students.\n\n“In-person classes are imperative to make up for the one-and-half year loss,” she said.\n\nThe education minister added that while it is possible to bring students 12 years or older under vaccine protection, there is growing concern regarding primary school students who are yet to become eligible.\n\nAccording to the minister, the education sector will be hit the hardest if the situation deteriorates and it will be difficult to say what another shutdown may do.\n\nBangladesh has so far recorded 21 Omicron cases and on Friday logged 1,146 new cases with the daily test positivity rising to 5.67% in 24 hours. The new cases were detected after testing 20,204 samples.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a test positivity of over 5% is a key concern for any country.\n\nMeanwhile, infections have surged all across the world including neighbouring India where health workers and hospitals are once more struggling to manage the heavy caseload.",

        "title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise",
        "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

        "title": "Rights to education and health",
        "body": "Globally, it is recognised that ‘educating children’ gives the next generation the most effective tools to fight poverty, prevent diseases, build resilience and create a progressive and peaceful society as ‘good health and well-being for all’ is the foundation of sustainable development. So, to protect and promote the universal rights to education and health are requisites for all aspects of social and economic development. Two articles, 17 and 28, of the constitution entrench universal rights to education, especially free primary education, as well as rights to freedom of choice to get the higher education keeping to everyone’s potential and merit. Article 18 (1) highlights the state’s primary duty to raise the nutrition level and to improve the public health. So, the constitutional mandate and the given commitment to the several international conventions such as United Nations’ Convention on Child Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights oblige obligate Bangladesh to ensure free access to quality education and improved health services. Despite being the basic human right, the constitution does not recognise the health right as the universal human rights. The global development framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, commits to leaving no one behind, which is a great premise to working together with international development partners to provide quality education and health services for all. What is the ground reality in both sectors: education and health? National statistics show that 40.72 per cent of children and youths are out of education because of multifaceted causes as well as the maternal and under-five child mortality rates are 163 per 100,000 live births (maternal mortality) and 30.6 deaths under 1000 live births (under-five mortality) respectively. This clearly indicates the state could not protect the education and health rights as the universal human rights. In addition, 51.4 per cent of girl children are married off they reach 18 and 11.3 per cent of children are engaged in labour. This is also a gross violation of children’s rights to development with their full potential. The disparities between rural and urban education and health services in terms of access to and the quality of services are unimaginable. The people in several poverty pockets such as delta, coastal and haor areas do not have minimum level of access to health care services and to quality education. There are union health complexes and government primary schools, but they are almost completely dysfunctional for lack of resources, isolation, negligence of the national and local government authorities, overlooking and exclusionary approach and the frame of mind of the political and community leaders, prevailing rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability and people’s ignorance and lack of voice for their rights and entitlement. However, only in some big cities, particularly in the capital city, a very few education and health facilities and institutions provide acceptable standards of health and education services. But that are expensive and completely out of reach of ordinary people. Only the affluent group of people, about 10 per cent of the population, can afford this good quality of health and education services. And, almost 90 per cent of the population and all of rural and marginalised people, who are penniless and powerless, receive education and health services from the dysfunctional and retrospective facilities and systems. As a result, not only individuals face the adverse impact of the dysfunctional health and education services, but also national development also suffers in all aspects. The health and education services have completely been turned into business through the hegemonic political systems and monopoly and manipulative business approaches. Good quality of education and health service systems are the main engines of all kinds of development, economic and social. But keeping the majority portion of the population out of the quality services, a country cannot get on the development highway. Research shows that one dollar’s investment in education and health sectors generates more than one dollar’s return; but in all other sectors, it creates less than one dollar’s return. It proves that the rates of returns on investment in education and health sectors are much higher than that of another sectors. The good quality of education and health services is also the most effective tools to achieve the sustainable development, including poverty alleviation and building resilience of individual, community and systems to climate change, natural and artificial shocks and disasters. Definitely, the constraint of resources — financial and expertise — is a challenge to provide good quality of education and health services as the national budget allocation is much less than what is required. Along with this limited resource allocation, rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability, political engagement of professionals, monopoly business approaches, denial of human rights and the lack of the rule of law destroy the education and health systems. A comprehensive, rights-based-approach is required to enable both parties, service recipients and providers, as rights holders and legal and moral duty bearers respectively so that they can effectively perform their duties in all kinds of businesses and services. The marginalised and excluded section of the population as rights holders need to be able enough to receive technical and non-technical supports to claim their rights and entitlement accordingly. A rights-based approach is complementary with humanitarian and democratic norms, the rule of law, transparency and accountability and it impacts well-being, progress and prosperity. It is imperative to create such an inclusive, integrated and rights-based business environment and platforms that help to attain the expected outcomes, promoting ethical business standards with humanity and prohibiting unethical and illegal business that only makes money. So, improvement in the quality of education and health services requires some important policy and strategic actions. Demonstrating strategic, visionary and people-centric leadership would dismantle the hegemonic myths, bringing all actors together to the playground with the highest standard of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Business syndicates of rights-based services systems over the monopoly and manipulative business systems in education and health sectors should be eliminated. Primary and essential health care and services must be free for all people and specialised health services must be affordable for the rural poor and marginalised people with an equitable access to good public health. Physicians must stay in community and union health complexes and provide specialised health services for rural people. Public and private partnership should be attempted at to address the challenges of resources constraints. The marginalised and excluded groups should be empowered to protect their rights to quality services. The government implements social safety net programmes to support the extreme poor and people with disabilities, but that is not effective because of political bias, corruption, abuse, exploitation and exclusion. Rights-based, service-oriented education and health systems should be established. It is essential to raise the floors of the extreme poor and marginalised people with education and empowerment programmes and initiatives so that they can raise their voice for their rights and entitlement. It is imperative that Bangladesh now should implement a comprehensive reform initiative, but no reforms will sustain in the long run if the reforms do not focus on education and health systems.

        "title": "Minimum standard of edn a must for MPO: Farruk",
        "body": "Education Minister Dr. Osman Farruk yesterday said Monthly Pay Order (MPO) and government grants to educational institutions must not be a \"permanent settlement\". \"The educational institutions that will fail to register a minimum performance should not have the right to claim government grants and facilities,\" he said while inaugurating as chief guest the national-level programme of the 'National Education Week-2003'. Held at the Osmani Memorial Hall under the auspices of the education ministry, the function was also addressed by State Minister for Education ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Deputy Minister Mohammad Abdus Salam Pinto as special guests. Presided over by Education Secretary Mohammad Shahidul Alam, the inaugural function was also addressed, among others, by Director General of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Directorate Abdur Rashid and Joint Secretary of the ministry Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. Dr. Osman Farruk said the education administration had become weak and full of irregularities and the managing committees almost \"non-functioning\" because of \"personal\" and \"coterie\" interests. \"Our government does not believe in politicisation of school and college managing committees,\" he said adding that to improve the prevailing situation, both responsibility and accountability of the governing bodies had to be enhanced. The education minister said the responsibility to improve the standard of education must be carried out jointly by its stakeholders -- teachers, students, guardians, civil society members and the government. The education minister said the curriculum as well as syllabus of the text books must be \"life-oriented\" and realistic so that real nation-building architects come out from the country's 107,000 educational institutions. The main work to attain this goal has to be carried out by 750,000 teachers employed in these institutions, he said. Turning to the quality education, the minister said \"We do not want to engage police to remove note books from the market, nor do we want to close down the private coaching centres right now.\" \"We have to go to the root of the problem and ask ourselves why students have become dependent on note books and coaching centres,\" he said, adding that teachers must perform their sacred jobs of imparting education and wisdom to their pupils in the class room for the full period of their contract hours before heading for coaching centres. \"We have to recast our education system so that the new generation can be injected with human and moral values and are well-educated,\" he said. He stressed the need for introducing an education system that is capable of achieving the basic objectives of education, like enlightening the learners, making them wise, knowledgeable and good citizens and capable of innovating new skills and strategies for nation-building purposes. Making a departure from his written speech, the education minister raised some important issues like adopting unfair means in examinations, misuse of funds and facilities, sufferings of the teachers in the corridors of education directorate and national university to get their problems addressed. At the same time, the minister hinted at some important measures his ministry is going to take to streamline this very important sector of national life. He said the education directorate and the national university would be further decentralised so that the teachers and others concerned could get their services without undergoing much hazard and inconvenience. The inaugural session was followed by National Education Conference entitled \"Education for Attaining Self-reliance\".",

The new cases were detected after testing 20,204 samples.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a test positivity of over 5% is a key concern for any country.\n\nMeanwhile, infections have surged all across the world including neighbouring India where health workers and hospitals are once more struggling to manage the heavy caseload.",

        "title": "How digital communication is redefining school-parent communication",
        "body": "Two parties play the most instrumental role in a child’s learning journey at school: the parents and the school authorities, particularly the teachers. Establishing a clear and consistent line of communication between these two is crucial to ensuring a child’s academic progress and overall development.\n\nFor decades, communication largely relied on paperwork: report cards, homework sheets, and various notices that students carried home in their backpacks. But this system was prone to gaps. Important messages, like teacher feedback or test dates, were often missed, leaving parents confused or uninformed about key developments.\n\nToday, with digital transformation sweeping through every sector, education is no exception. Communication between teachers and parents is rapidly shifting from traditional methods, handwritten notes, phone calls, and in-person meetings, to more streamlined, digital platforms that cater to the pace and needs of modern families.\n\nThis shift not only facilitates faster communication but also helps build stronger partnerships between home and school.\n\nMore and more parents now prefer digital updates over physical meetings, reflecting a change in expectations from schools. This is a positive trend: as studies suggest, informed parents are better positioned to support their children’s growth. According to educational psychologists, when parents stay engaged and monitor their child’s progress regularly, it leads to stronger academic outcomes and emotional well-being.\n\nIn light of this, many progressive schools are embracing digital platforms for parent communication. One such initiative is being implemented at Glenrich International School, where we have recently launched a dedicated parent communication app. This platform offers parents real-time access to their child’s academic updates, class schedules, and feedback—all in one place, without needing to call or visit the school.\n\nThe advantages of such tools are multifaceted. Parents receive instant notifications about attendance, academic performance, behavior, and upcoming school events. Teachers can share photos, videos, and summaries of classroom activities, giving parents a window into their child’s learning day. Real-time messaging allows urgent information, like schedule changes or emergencies, to be shared without delay, ensuring that parents can respond immediately when needed.\n\nMoreover, these digital tools foster a collaborative environment. Two-way communication, through instant messaging, direct feedback, or group announcements, builds trust and transparency. This helps create a strong sense of community between educators and families, all united in supporting the student’s success.\n\nResearch from Southeast Missouri State University has found that digital communication tools enhance student learning by encouraging collaboration, quick access to information, and personalized support. Increased parental involvement, enabled by these platforms, directly correlates with improved learning outcomes.\n\nWhen digital tools are proving effective in improving communication, engagement, and student performance, it’s worth asking: Why hold on to outdated methods? It’s time for all schools to reconsider their approach and embrace the digital shift that supports every child’s growth journey.\n\nAnit Arora is theprincipal of Glenrich International School, Satarkul.",

        "body": "Bangladesh is set to introduce its first national emergency alert system—Missing Urgent Notification (MUN Alert)—to speed up the rescue of missing and abducted children.\n\nAlongside this initiative, a 24/7 toll-free helpline—13219—is being officially introduced to receive information related to missing children across the country.\n\nCID Chief Additional Inspector General Sibgat Ullah made the disclosure at a press briefing in its headquarters on Tuesday.\n\nThe MUN Alert system has been developed under the leadership of the Missing Children Cell of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Bangladesh Police, with technical and coordination support from the Zero Missing Children Platform and international collaboration from the Amber Alert for Bangladesh team.\n\nThe initiative draws inspiration from the globally recognized AMBER Alert system, first launched in the United States following the 1996 abduction and murder of child Amber Hagerman.\n\nSimilar systems are now in place across Europe and in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, China, Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan.\n\nInternational research shows that the first few hours after a child goes missing are critical, and timely, verified alerts significantly increase the chances of safe recovery.\n\nIn the context of Bangladesh, tragic incidents—including the disappearance and murder of five-year-old Muntaha Akhter in Sylhet in 2024—have underscored the urgent need for a fast, integrated and technology-driven response mechanism.\n\nUnder the MUN Alert system, when there is reasonable suspicion that a child is missing or abducted, the CID will issue an emergency alert based on verified information.\n\nThe alert may be disseminated through an official web portal and mobile app, online and offline media, social media platforms, digital billboards, mobile SMS or cell broadcasting, and other technology-based channels to ensure widespread public awareness and participation.\n\nAuthorities emphasized that the dignity, safety and privacy of the child will remain paramount throughout the process.\n\nMembers of the public can report information about missing children through the national emergency service 999, the Missing Children Cell hotline (01320017060), or the newly launched toll-free helpline 13219.\n\nThe authority to verify information, assess risk levels, and issue, suspend or withdraw alerts will rest solely with the Missing Children Cell of the CID.\n\nWhere necessary, Yellow Notices may be issued through INTERPOL in cases involving risks of cross-border movement or child trafficking.\n\nThe initiative is being implemented in collaboration with the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)—the organization that manages the global Amber Alert system—and Meta (Facebook), working closely with the CID and the Zero Missing Children Platform.\n\nStakeholders expressed strong optimism that the launch of MUN Alert will establish a state-led, technology-based and integrated national framework for rescuing missing children, significantly strengthening child protection and access to justice in Bangladesh.",

        "body": "পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নে সরকারি-বেসরকারি ৪০টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান রয়েছে। এর মধ্যে ১৩টিই ফকিরহাট এলাকায়। দুই কিলোমিটার দূরত্বের মধ্যে গড়ে উঠেছে ১৩টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান। সব প্রতিষ্ঠানেই প্রয়োজনীয় শিক্ষক-শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। পাবলিক পরীক্ষায় ফলও ভালো। এত কম দূরত্বে এত শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান গড়ে ওঠায় এলাকায় ঝরে পড়া শিক্ষার্থীর সংখ্যা যেমন কমেছে, তেমনি বেড়েছে উচ্চশিক্ষা নেওয়ার হারও। ওই এলাকার নাম ফকিরহাট। এ নামের সঙ্গে মিল রেখে স্থানীয়ভাবে এলাকাটি ‘শিক্ষার হাট’ হিসেবে পরিচিতি পেয়েছে। এটি গাইবান্ধার পলাশবাড়ী উপজেলার পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নের বালাবামুনিয়া গ্রামে। পবনাপুর ইউনিয়ন পরিষদের (ইউপি) ভারপ্রাপ্ত চেয়ারম্যান শাহিনুর বেগম বলেন, প্রায় ২০ হাজার মানুষের এ ইউনিয়নে সরকারি-বেসরকারি ৪০টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান রয়েছে। এসব প্রতিষ্ঠানের ১৩টিই ফকিরহাট এলাকায়। এর মধ্যে প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় সাতটি, মাধ্যমিক বিদ্যালয় দুইটি, কলেজ দুইটি ও মাদ্রাসা দুইটি। পলাশবাড়ী উপজেলা সদর থেকে ১৪ কিলোমিটার দূরে বালাবামুনিয়া গ্রাম। এ গ্রামেরই প্রাণকেন্দ্র ফকিরহাট। এখানে একটি বাজার, ঈদগাহ ও ডাকঘরও আছে। ফকিরহাট বাজার ঘেঁষে সীমানাপ্রাচীর দিয়ে ঘেরা ফকিরহাট সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয়। এ দুটি প্রতিষ্ঠান একই ক্যাম্পাসে অবস্থিত। গত বৃহস্পতিবার দুপুরে ফটক পেরিয়ে ভেতরে ঢুকতেই কানে এল শিশুদের কলরব। তারা প্রাথমিক ও মাধ্যমিক বিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষার্থী। শ্রেণিকক্ষ থেকেই তাদের পড়ার সুর ভেসে আসছিল। কক্ষে ঢুকে সব ক্লাসেই শিক্ষার্থীদের সরব উপস্থিতি পাওয়া গেল। প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক দিলীপ কুমার সরকার বলেন, বিদ্যালয়টি ১৯৪৩ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত। এখন এখানে ১৩৫ শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। সর্বশেষ পাবলিক পরীক্ষায় পাসের হার শতভাগ। ২০১৯ সালের মেধাবৃত্তি (ট্যালেন্ট পুলে) দুজন ও সর্বশেষ একজন বৃত্তি পায়। প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের আঙিনা পেরিয়েই ১৯৩৮ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয়। ততক্ষণে মধ্যাহ্ন বিরতি হয়েছে। শিক্ষার্থীদের পদচারণে মুখর হয়েছে মাঠ। কেউ ফুটবল নিয়ে মেতেছে, কেউবা খেলছে ক্রিকেট। মেয়েরাও দাঁড়িয়াবান্ধা, বউছিসহ নানা খেলায় ব্যস্ত। এ বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক শফিকুল ইসলাম সরকার। তিনি বলেন, এখানে শিক্ষার্থী ৫৬৩ জন। এর মধ্যে ছাত্রী ২০০, ছাত্র ৩৬৩। সর্বশেষ পাবলিক পরীক্ষার ফল বেশ ভালো। পাসের হার ৭৯ দশমিক ৩৪। শিক্ষক ১৫ জন, কর্মচারী ৬ জন। স্থানীয় লোকজন জানান, এ গ্রামে প্রথমে মরহুম মোতাহার আলী খন্দকার ও হবিবর রহমান খন্দকারের সার্বিক সহযোগিতায় ১৯৩৮ সালে ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয় গড়ে ওঠে। ১৯৬৭ সালে এ বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক ছিলেন ফজলুল হক খন্দকার। তাঁর নেতৃত্বে বিদ্যালয়টি ধীরে ধীরে ভালো ফল করতে থাকে। আশপাশের গ্রামের অভিভাবকেরাও বিদ্যালয়টিতে সন্তানদের পড়াতে আগ্রহী হয়ে ওঠেন। বিদ্যালয়টিতে এখন ১৪ জন শিক্ষক ও ৫৬৩ জন শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। ফজলুল হকের প্রচেষ্টায় আরও কয়েকটি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান গড়ে ওঠে। অবসরপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষক ফজলুল হক বলেন, ‘সে সময় আমি বাড়ি বাড়ি গিয়ে শিক্ষার্থীদের লেখাপড়ার খোঁজখবর নিয়েছি। দুর্বল শিক্ষার্থীদের বাড়তি পাঠদান, অর্থ ও বই–খাতা দিয়ে সহায়তা করেছি।’ বিদ্যালয় দুটি থেকে বের হয়ে ১০০ গজ পূর্বে এলেই হাতের বাঁ পাশে প্রাচীরঘেরা ফকিরহাট শহীদ স্মৃতি ডিগ্রি কলেজের ক্যাম্পাস। এখানে ঢুকে দেখা গেল, কোনো কক্ষে চলছে পাঠদান। কোথাও আড্ডা দিচ্ছেন শিক্ষার্থীরা। কলেজটির শিক্ষার্থী নুরী আকতার বলেন, তিনি এ গ্রামের বাসিন্দা। এখান থেকেই প্রাথমিক, মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চমাধ্যমিক পাস করে এখন স্নাতকে পড়ছেন। কষ্ট করে দূরে কোথাও না গিয়ে বাড়িতে থেকেই উচ্চশিক্ষার সুযোগ পেয়েছেন। এতে একদিকে যেমন বাড়ির কাজে সাহায্য করতে পেরেছেন, তেমনি পড়াশোনার খরচও বেঁচেছে। কলেজটির ভারপ্রাপ্ত অধ্যক্ষ আবদুল আলিম খন্দকার জানান, তাঁর কলেজে প্রায় ৭০০ শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। সর্বশেষ পাসের হার ৬৩ দশমিক ৬৯। এবার স্নাতকে পাসের হার ছিল ৮৬ ভাগ। ফকিরহাট বাজার থেকে ৪০০ গজ দক্ষিণে ফকিরহাট আল্লার দরগা দাখিল মাদ্রাসা অবস্থিত। ৪১০ গজ পূর্বে শহীদ খায়রুল আলম উচ্চবালিকা বিদ্যালয়। মাদ্রাসাটি ১৯৯৪ সালে ও বালিকা বিদ্যালয়টি ১৯৭৩ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত। বাজার থেকে ৬৫০ গজ দূরে ২০০৫ সালে ফকিরহাট মদিনাতুল উলুম কওমি হাফিজিয়া মাদ্রাসা গড়ে ওঠে। বাজার থেকে ৫৫০ গজ দূরে ১৯৮৪ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়। ৬৫০ গজ দূরে ১৯৯০ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া বালিকা সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ৬০০ গজ দূরে ১৯৯৫ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া ফকিরপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়। দুই কিলোমিটার দূরে ১৯৮৫ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া আদর্শ সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ২০০ গজ দূরে ২০০০ সালে স্থাপিত ফকিরহাট মহিলা কলেজ। দেড় কিলোমিটার দূরে ১৯৯৫ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় বালাবামুনিয়া পূর্বপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় এবং ৬০০ গজ দুরে ১৯৮৫ সালে স্থাপিত সমিতিরহাট বালাবামুনিয়া উত্তরপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়। পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নের দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত সহকারী প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা কর্মকর্তা (এইউইও) আবদুল হাই বলেন, কাছাকাছি এতগুলো বিদ্যালয় থাকলেও সবগুলোতেই পর্যাপ্ত শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। এত বেশি বিদ্যালয় থাকায় এলাকাটিতে ঝরে পড়া শিক্ষার্থীও নেই বললেই চলে। গাইবান্ধার সহকারী জেলা প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা কর্মকর্তা এসএম আরশাদ বলেন, প্রতিষ্ঠানের চাহিদা থাকায় ফকিরহাটের ওই সব প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়গুলো আগেই গড়ে ওঠেছে। পরবর্তীতে সেগুলোকে সরকারি করা হয়। তবে নতুন করে প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠার ক্ষেত্রে একটি থেকে আরেকটি দূরত্ব ২ কিলোমিটার হতে হবে। তিনি আরও বলেন, প্রতিটি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ে ন্যূনতম ৫০ জন শিক্ষার্থী থাকতে হবে। এর কম হলে ঊর্ধ্বতন কর্তৃপক্ষকে জানাতে হয়। সে বিষয়ে তারা সিদ্ধান্ত দেবেন। তবে ফকিরহাটের বিদ্যালয়গুলোতে প্রয়োজনীয় শিক্ষার্থী ও শিক্ষক রয়েছে।",

        "title": "মাদ্রাসায় চালু হচ্ছে ‘ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা’, অনুমোদন পেতে শর্ত প্রযোজ্য",
        "body": "বাংলাদেশের মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় প্রথমবারের মতো দাখিল (এসএসসি সমমান) স্তরে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু হতে যাচ্ছে। আগামী শিক্ষাবর্ষ থেকেই দেশব্যাপী নির্দিষ্ট শর্তসাপেক্ষে মাদ্রাসাগুলোতে এই বিভাগ চালুর অনুমোদন দেবে বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ড। এরই মধ্যে নতুন কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপি চূড়ান্তকরণের কাজ চলছে। নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী, ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষেই ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর জন্য শতাধিক মাদ্রাসা আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ শিক্ষাবর্ষের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টির বেশি আবেদন। জানা গেছে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর উদ্যোগ এটি প্রথম নয়। এর আগে গত এক দশকে দুই দফায় এই প্রচেষ্টা নেওয়া হলেও তা বাস্তবে রূপ পায়নি। কর্মকর্তা ও নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, সরকারের অনীহা, প্রশাসনিক জটিলতা এবং নীতিগত অসহযোগিতার কারণে তৎকালীন সময়ে উদ্যোগটি থেমে যায়। বোর্ড সূত্রে জানা যায়, ২০১৪ সালের দিকে প্রথমবার ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর নীতিগত আলোচনা শুরু হয়। কিন্তু সে সময় শিক্ষানীতি বাস্তবায়ন নিয়ে অস্পষ্টতা, বাজেট সংকট এবং রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে বিষয়টি এগোয়নি। পরবর্তীতে ২০১৮ সালে দ্বিতীয়বার এই প্রস্তাব তোলা হলে পরিবর্তনশীল সরকারি অগ্রাধিকার এবং প্রশাসনিক সাড়া না পাওয়ায় উদ্যোগটি আবারও বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, তখন মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাকে মূলধারায় আনার কথা বলা হলেও কার্যকর পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়নি। শিক্ষক নিয়োগ, পাঠ্যপুস্তক তৈরি, কারিকুলাম অনুমোদন— প্রতিটি ধাপেই নানা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বাধা প্রকল্পটিকে স্থবির করে তোলে। তবে, বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি ভিন্ন বলে মনে করছেন সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তারা। নতুন শিক্ষা কাঠামো, দক্ষতাভিত্তিক শিক্ষার ওপর জোর এবং মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় কর্মমুখী বিষয় যুক্ত করার সরকারি আগ্রহের কারণে এবার উদ্যোগটি সফল হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা অনেক বেশি। তাদের মতে, এখন রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছা ও প্রশাসনিক সহযোগিতা থাকায় বাস্তবায়ন অগ্রগতিও দ্রুত হয়েছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের চেয়ারম্যান মিঞা মো. নূরুল হক ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিষয় চালুর নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত বাস্তবায়নে আন্তরিকভাবে চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। তবে, শুরুতে সব মাদ্রাসায় এর অনুমোদন মিলবে না। সেজন্য তিনটি শর্ত অবশ্যই পূরণ করতে হবে- প্রথমত, সংশ্লিষ্ট মাদ্রাসায় চলতি বছরে অষ্টম শ্রেণিতে ন্যূনতম ১০০ শিক্ষার্থী থাকতে হবে। দ্বিতীয়ত, পর্যাপ্ত ভৌত অবকাঠামো থাকতে হবে, যাতে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগের জন্য অন্তত দুটি অতিরিক্ত শ্রেণিকক্ষ চালু করলেও অন্যান্য ক্লাস ব্যাহত না হয়। তৃতীয়ত, এনটিআরসিএর মাধ্যমে শিক্ষক নিয়োগ না আসা পর্যন্ত মাদ্রাসার নিজস্ব তহবিল থেকে খণ্ডকালীন ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শিক্ষক নিয়োগ দেওয়ার সক্ষমতা থাকতে হবে। চেয়ারম্যান বলেন, ‘এই তিনটি মাপকাঠি (ক্রাইটেরিয়া) যাদের আছে এবং যারা আগ্রহী, কেবল তারাই আবেদন করতে পারবেন। বাস্তবতা দেখে পরবর্তীতে শর্ত শিথিল করার বিষয়টি বিবেচনা করা হবে।’ বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার দপ্তর বলছে, এরইমধ্যে ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ খোলার জন্য শতাধিক প্রতিষ্ঠান আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ সালের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টি মাদ্রাসার আবেদন। বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার অধ্যাপক ছালেহ আহমাদ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘বর্তমানে যুগের চাহিদার সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্য রেখে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রতি ব্যাপক আগ্রহ দেখা যাচ্ছে। আমরা চাই সংখ্যার চেয়ে মানের ওপর বেশি গুরুত্ব দিতে, যাতে শিক্ষার্থীরা ভবিষ্যতে জাতীয় অর্থনীতিতে দক্ষ মানবসম্পদ হিসেবে অবদান রাখতে পারে।’ তিনি বলেন, এসব আবেদন প্রাথমিকভাবে বাছাই করা হচ্ছে। সরেজমিন পরিদর্শনের মাধ্যমে প্রত্যেকটি প্রতিষ্ঠানের অবকাঠামো, শিক্ষক সংকট, শ্রেণিকক্ষ, ল্যাব সুবিধা এবং প্রশাসনিক সক্ষমতা যাচাই করা হবে। নীতিমালা অনুযায়ী শর্ত পূরণ হলেই কেবল পর্যায়ক্রমে অনুমোদন দেওয়া হবে। এজন্য বোর্ড সর্বোচ্চ স্বচ্ছতা, জবাবদিহি ও মাননিয়ন্ত্রণ নিশ্চিত করেই অনুমোদনের প্রক্রিয়া সম্পন্ন করবে বলেও মন্তব্য করেন তিনি। অন্যদিকে বোর্ড কর্মকর্তারা বলছেন, যুগোপযোগী শিক্ষার বিস্তারে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করা অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কারণ দেশে ব্যাংকিং, হিসাবরক্ষণ, ব্যবসায় ব্যবস্থাপনা, উদ্যোক্তা উন্নয়ন ও ইসলামী অর্থনীতি— এসব ক্ষেত্রে দক্ষ জনশক্তির চাহিদা বাড়ছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীরা এত দিন এই মূলধারার সুযোগ থেকে বেশিরভাগই বঞ্চিত ছিল। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের কারিকুলাম বিশেষজ্ঞ ড. মোহাম্মদ হেদায়েত উল্লাহ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘আলিয়া মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শাখা চালুর জন্য কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপির চূড়ান্তকরণ এখন শেষ পর্যায়ে। নতুন বইগুলোর প্রায় ৯৫ শতাংশ সাধারণ স্কুল–কলেজের ব্যবসায় শিক্ষার বইয়ের মতোই হবে। তবে ইসলামী অর্থনীতি, সুদের ধারণা, নৈতিক ব্যবসা পরিচালনা ও শরিয়াহভিত্তিক বাণিজ্যব্যবস্থা— এসব অতিরিক্ত বিষয় যুক্ত করা হয়েছে।’ তিনি আরও বলেন, ‘ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রক্রিয়াটি দীর্ঘদিন ধরেই চলমান। আগেও দুবার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছিল, কিন্তু নীতিগত ও কাঠামোগত নানা কারণে তা বাস্তবায়িত হয়নি। এবার সরকার পরিবর্তনের পর নতুন করে নীতিগত অগ্রাধিকারে এই উদ্যোগ দ্রুত এগোচ্ছে। মাদ্রাসার শিক্ষার্থীরা এর ফলে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক দক্ষতার পথে বড় সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘বছরের শুরুতেই নতুন বিভাগে পাঠদান শুরু করার প্রস্তুতি নেওয়া হচ্ছে। প্রয়োজন হলে ফেব্রুয়ারি পর্যন্ত অতিরিক্ত সময় নিয়ে বই পৌঁছানো হবে। তবে, পরবর্তী শিক্ষাবর্ষে পাঠ্যবইগুলো আরও আধুনিকায়ন করা হবে’— বলেন ড. হেদায়েতুল্লাহ। অন্যদিকে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করতে সরকারের এমন সিদ্ধান্তকে বড় পরিবর্তনের উদ্যোগ হিসেবে দেখছেন মাদ্রাসাপ্রধানরা। তারা বলছেন, বর্তমান চাহিদা অনুযায়ী এমন সিদ্ধান্ত সময়োপযোগী ও যুগান্তকারী। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য কর্মমুখী শিক্ষার সুযোগ সৃষ্টির দাবি ছিল। ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর ফলে এখন আমাদের শিক্ষার্থীরা বিজ্ঞান ও মানবিক শাখার পাশাপাশি আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞান লাভ করে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে সরাসরি অবদান রাখতে পারবে। এই উদ্যোগ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার প্রতি সাধারণ মানুষের আগ্রহ আরও বাড়িয়ে তুলবে। ময়মনসিংহের কাতলাসেন কাদেরিয়া কামিল মাদ্রাসার অধ্যক্ষ দেলোয়ার হোসেন আজিজী ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘এটি আমাদের জন্য একটি বিশাল সুযোগ। এত দিন মাদ্রাসার ছাত্রদের জন্য কর্মসংস্থান ও উচ্চশিক্ষার ক্ষেত্র কিছুটা সীমিত ছিল। নতুন এই বিভাগ চালু হওয়ায় শিক্ষার্থীরা এখন ব্যাংক, বীমা, কর্পোরেট হাউজসহ বিভিন্ন ব্যবসায়িক প্রতিষ্ঠানে নিজেদের ক্যারিয়ার গড়ার সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘আমরা আশা করি, তারা ইসলামী মূল্যবোধ ও নৈতিকতার সঙ্গে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞানের সমন্বয় ঘটিয়ে সৎ ও যোগ্য উদ্যোক্তা হিসেবে সমাজে নিজেদের প্রতিষ্ঠিত করতে সক্ষম হবে’— মনে করেন এই অধ্যক্ষ।",

        "body": "শিক্ষকদের আর্থিক নিরাপত্তা, চাকরির স্থায়ীকরণ ও সম্মানজনক অবস্থান নিশ্চিত করতে উচ্চপর্যায়ের কমিশন গঠনের ঘোষণা দিয়েছেন বিএনপির ভারপ্রাপ্ত চেয়ারম্যান তারেক রহমান। মঙ্গলবার (৭ অক্টোবর) রাজধানীর সোহরাওয়ার্দী উদ্যানে বিশ্ব শিক্ষক দিবস উপলক্ষ্যে ‘শিক্ষক-কর্মচারী ঐক্যজোট’ আয়োজিত এক সমাবেশে ভিডিও বার্তায় তিনি এই ঘোষণা দেন। তারেক রহমান বলেন, আমরা বিশ্বাস করি, রাষ্ট্রে শিক্ষকদের মর্যাদার সঙ্গে রাষ্ট্রের সম্মান জড়িত। দুর্নীতিবাজরা বিত্তবান হলে সমাজের ভাবমূর্তি নষ্ট হয়, আর শিক্ষকের মর্যাদা অক্ষুণ্ণ থাকলে সমাজ শক্ত ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড়ায়। রাষ্ট্র এবং সমাজে দুর্নীতি নামক ব্যাধি রয়েছে উল্লেখ করে তারেক রহমান বলেন, সমাজকে দুর্নীতিমুক্ত করতে হলে স্কুল, কলেজ ও মাদ্রাসার শিক্ষকগণ দুর্নীতির বিরুদ্ধে সামাজিক বিপ্লব গড়ে তোলার ক্ষেত্রে যোগ্য ভূমিকা পালন করতে পারেন বলে আমি মনে করি। তিনি বলেন, জনগণের ভোটে বিএনপি আবারো রাষ্ট্র পরিচালনার সুযোগ পেলে রাষ্ট্রের সামর্থ্য অনুযায়ী শিক্ষকদের আর্থিক নিরাপত্তা বেষ্টনী বাড়ানো, চাকরি স্থায়ীকরণ কিংবা জাতীয়করণের বিষয়টি ইতিবাচকভাবে বিবেচনার জন্য উচ্চপর্যায়ের কমিশন গঠন করব। তারেক রহমান বলেন, অতীতের ভালো দৃষ্টান্তগুলো থেকে অভিজ্ঞতা অর্জন আর খারাপ দৃষ্টান্তগুলো বর্জনের মধ্য দিয়ে একটি সমৃদ্ধ, সুন্দর, নিরাপদ, মানবিক বাংলাদেশ গড়ার কর্মপরিকল্পনা বাস্তবায়নই হোক আমাদের এই সময়ের অঙ্গীকার। বিশ্ব এখন আর্টিফিশিয়াল ইন্টেলিজেন্সের (কৃত্রিম বুদ্ধিমত্তা) যুগে প্রবেশ করেছে উল্লেখ করে বিএনপির শীর্ষ এই নেতা বলেন, জ্ঞানে-বিজ্ঞানে বিশ্ব এগিয়ে যাচ্ছে। প্রতিযোগিতামূলক এই বিশ্বে সমান ও মর্যাদার সঙ্গে একটি প্রভাবশালী জাতিরাষ্ট্র হিসেবে টিকে থাকাই আমাদের সামনে এই মুহূর্তের সবচেয়ে বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। এই চ্যালেঞ্জ মোকাবিলায় আমাদের অর্থ-বিত্তে, মেধা-মননে, জ্ঞানে-বিজ্ঞানে সমৃদ্ধ হতেই হবে। প্রতিষ্ঠা করতে হবে জ্ঞানভিত্তিক রাষ্ট্র এবং সমাজ। দেশের শিক্ষকগণই হচ্ছেন জ্ঞানভিত্তিক রাষ্ট্র-সমাজ গড়ার অন্যতম প্রধান হাতিয়ার। সুতরাং এই হাতিয়ার যদি দুর্বল হয়, তাহলে রাষ্ট্রকে শক্তিশালী ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করানো সম্ভব নয়। শিক্ষক সম্পর্কে জগৎবিখ্যাত পদার্থবিজ্ঞানী আলবার্ট আইনস্টাইনের একটি কথা তিনি মনে করিয়ে দেন: তিনি বলেছিলেন— ‘সৃষ্টিশীল প্রকাশ এবং জ্ঞানের মধ্যে আনন্দ জাগ্রত করা হলো শিক্ষকের সর্বপ্রধান শিল্প'।’ প্রাথমিক থেকে শুরু করে সর্বোচ্চ বিদ্যাপীঠ পর্যন্ত সরকারি-বেসরকারি, এমপিও কিংবা নন-এমপিও সব মিলিয়ে সারাদেশে শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের সংখ্যা কমবেশি সম্ভবত প্রায় ৯৫ হাজার বলে উল্লেখ করেন তারেক রহমান। তিনি বলেন, এরমধ্যে সম্ভবত সম্পূর্ণ এমপিওভুক্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানের সংখ্যা ২৬ হাজারের বেশি। জনসংখ্যার তুলনায় দেশের বর্তমানে শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের এই সংখ্যাকে হয়তো বেশি বলা যাবে না। কিন্তু সবাই মিলে শিক্ষক-শিক্ষার্থী এবং বিদ্যমান শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর গুণগতমান নিশ্চিত করতেই হবে। দেশের শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থাকে পুঁথিনির্ভর না রেখে শিক্ষা কারিকুলামকে স্কুল পর্যায় থেকেই ব্যবহারিক এবং কারিগরি নির্ভর শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থায় রূপান্তর করার বিকল্প নেই। একটি দায়িত্বশীল রাজনৈতিক দল হিসেবে বিএনপি ইতোমধ্যেই বিশেষজ্ঞদের নিয়ে প্রয়োজনীয় কর্মপরিকল্পনা প্রণয়নের কাজ শুরু করেছে। তারেক রহমান বলেন, শিক্ষক-শিক্ষিকারা যাতে নিজেকে একজন রোল মডেল হিসেবে শিক্ষার্থীদের সামনে আত্মবিশ্বাসের সঙ্গে উপস্থাপন করতে পারেন, সে ধরনের শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থাপনা প্রণয়নে বিএনপি বাস্তবধর্মী পরিকল্পনা নিয়ে কাজ করছে। বিএনপির কর্মপরিকল্পনায় শিক্ষকদের আর্থিক এবং সামাজিক নিরাপত্তা নিশ্চিতের ব্যাপারেও সুনির্দিষ্ট এবং বাস্তবমুখী পদক্ষেপ নিয়ে কাজ করছি। দেশের শিক্ষক সমাজের, বিশেষ করে স্কুল-মাদ্রাসা, প্রাথমিক, মাধ্যমিক এবং উচ্চ-মাধ্যমিক পর্যায়ের শিক্ষকদের আর্থিক নিরাপত্তার নিশ্চয়তা এবং সামাজিক সম্মান সুসমুন্নত করে শিক্ষকতা পেশাকে সুযোগ এবং সম্মানের দিক থেকে প্রতিযোগিতামূলক করে গড়ে তোলা প্রয়োজন। আমি আগেও বলেছি, শিক্ষকতা পেশা কখনোই ‘উপায়হীন বিকল্প’ কিংবা একটি সাধারণ চাকরির মতো হতে পারে না। বরং, শিক্ষা-দীক্ষায় সবচেয়ে মেধাবী মানুষটি যাতে কর্মজীবনে প্রথম অগ্রাধিকার হিসেবে শিক্ষকতা পেশাকে বেছে নিতে আগ্রহী হয়ে ওঠেন, বিএনপি শিক্ষক নিয়োগ এবং শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থাকে সেভাবেই ঢেলে সাজানোর পরিকল্পনা এবং উপায় নিয়ে কাজ করছে। তিনি বলেন, একইসঙ্গে প্রচলিত শিক্ষা কারিকুলামকে ব্যবহারিক এবং কারিগরি শিক্ষা প্রধান করে ঢেলে সাজানোর লক্ষ্যে অগ্রাধিকার ভিত্তিতে ‘শিক্ষা সংস্কার কমিশন’ গঠন করা হবে। নৈতিকতা এবং ধর্মীয়-সামাজিক মূল্যবোধের আলোকে কর্মমুখী শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থা প্রবর্তন এবং শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার আধুনিকায়নে জরুরি ভিত্তিতে পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণ করা না গেলে বৈশ্বিক প্রতিযোগিতায় টিকে থাকা আমাদের জন্য কঠিন হয়ে পড়বে। তারেক রহমান বলেন, রাষ্ট্র-রাজনীতি এবং সরকারের উন্নয়নে বিএনপির গৃহীত সকল পরিকল্পনা বাস্তবায়নের জন্য প্রয়োজন জনগণের স্বতঃস্ফূর্ত সমর্থন। প্রয়োজন দেশের সবচেয়ে সচেতন অংশ— শিক্ষকদের সমর্থন। একটি জ্ঞান ও মেধাভিত্তিক রাষ্ট্র এবং সরকার গঠনে আসন্ন নির্বাচনে বিএনপি আপনাদের সমর্থন এবং সহায়তা চায়। বিএনপি সম্মানিত শিক্ষক-কর্মচারী ভাই-বোনদের আন্তরিক সহযোগিতা চায়।",

        "body": "সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করতে বা শিক্ষার মানোন্নয়নে শাসকশ্রেণির কোনো ভূমিকা দেখছেন না অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। তিনি বলেন, যাঁরা শাসকশ্রেণির অন্তর্ভুক্ত, তাঁদের সন্তান কিংবা নাতি-নাতনিরা ভালো মানের বেসরকারি ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করেছে, করছে ও করবে। ‘বাংলাদেশে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ: অধিকতর ন্যায়পরায়ণ সমাজের পথরেখা’ শিরোনামে শনিবার রাতে একটি অনুষ্ঠানে বক্তব্য দেন গবেষণা সংস্থা সেন্টার ফর পলিসি ডায়ালগের (সিপিডি) চেয়ারম্যান অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। রাজধানীর বাংলামোটরে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রে এই অনুষ্ঠানের আয়োজন করে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘ। অনুষ্ঠানে অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা বিভক্ত। এই বিভক্তি দূর করতে না পারলে সামনে শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় আরও সামাজিক সংঘাত অপেক্ষা করছে। শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণের জন্য কয়েকটি প্রস্তাব তুলে ধরেন রেহমান সোবহান। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, পাবলিক এডুকেশন (সরকারিভাবে শিক্ষার ব্যবস্থা) এমন একটা পর্যায়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে, যেখানে সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করা যায়। এ জন্য শিক্ষা খাতে বরাদ্দ তিন গুণ বাড়াতে হবে। নিম্ন আয়ের পরিবারের সন্তানদের স্বল্প মেয়াদে ভালো শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে আসন বরাদ্দ রাখা ও বৃত্তি দেওয়ার মতো সহযোগিতা সরকারের দিক থেকে থাকতে পারে বলে প্রস্তাবে উল্লেখ করেন তিনি। অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের নেতারা বছরের পর বছর মাতৃভাষায় মানসম্মত শিক্ষার উন্নয়নে ভূমিকা রাখেননি, যা পূর্ব বা দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়ার দেশগুলো করেছে। এর বিপরীততে দেশে ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানকে উৎসাহিত করা হয়েছে। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, এমনটা করা যেতে পারে, যাঁরা সংসদ সদস্য পদে নির্বাচন করতে চান, তাঁদের সন্তানদের বাধ্যতামূলকভাবে বাংলা মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করাতে হবে। সন্তানেরা সরকারি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়লে এর মান বাড়ানোর চেষ্টা করবেন তাঁরা। তবে তিনি বলেন, এমন প্রত্যাশা তাঁর কল্পনা ছাড়া কিছু নয়। রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, শিক্ষায় নিয়ম ও সুশাসন ফিরিয়ে আনতে হবে। আর এটা তখনই সম্ভব হবে, যখন অর্থ বা পেশিশক্তির পরিবর্তে জবাবদিহি, অন্তর্ভুক্তিমূলক ও গণতান্ত্রিক প্রক্রিয়া প্রতিষ্ঠা করা যাবে। দীর্ঘ মেয়াদে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ করতে হলে রাজনীতিকে গণতান্ত্রিক করতে হবে এবং গণতান্ত্রিক সমাজ লাগবে। গণতান্ত্রিক শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় যাত্রা দীর্ঘ, কিন্তু এই যাত্রা বাধ্যতামূলক। অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এখন পর্যন্ত শিক্ষায় যথেষ্ট গুরুত্ব দেয়নি উল্লেখ করে অনুষ্ঠানে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রের প্রতিষ্ঠাতা অধ্যাপক আবদুল্লাহ আবু সায়ীদ বলেন, শিক্ষা যে সবচেয়ে আনন্দময়, সবচেয়ে উপকারী এবং সমৃদ্ধির ঘটক—এই কথাটা সমাজের মধ্যে আনা যায়নি। দেশের রাজনীতিবিদদের কখনোই দেখা যায়নি যে তাঁরা চিন্তাশীল মানুষের কথা শোনেন। যে কারণে দেশের জ্ঞানী ব্যক্তিদের পরামর্শ ও উপদেশ রাজনীতির ক্ষেত্রে প্রভাব রাখে না। ডেইলি স্টার সম্পাদক মাহ্ফুজ আনাম বলেন, যার যার জায়গা থেকে খুব ক্ষুদ্র স্তরে হলেও পরিবর্তনের সূচনা করতে হবে। গৃহকর্মীদের ছেলেমেয়েদের পড়াশোনার জন্য অর্থ সহযোগিতা দিয়ে এই পরিবর্তনের অংশ হওয়া যেতে পারে বলে মনে করেন তিনি। অনুষ্ঠানের সঞ্চালক ছিলেন বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘের সদস্য সিরাজুল ইসলাম কাদির। আরও বক্তব্য দেন মেটলাইফ বাংলাদেশের প্রধান নির্বাহী কর্মকর্তা আলাউদ্দিন আহমদ। অনুষ্ঠানে আরও উপস্থিত ছিলেন সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো অধ্যাপক রওনক জাহান, অধ্যাপক এম এম আকাশ ও সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো মোস্তাফিজুর রহমান।",

        "body": "দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলে বাংলাদেশ জামায়াতে ইসলামীর সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল অধ্যাপক মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেছেন, শুধু সেক্যুলার শিক্ষা মানুষকে নৈতিক চরিত্র দিতে পারে না, বরং ইসলামের সুশিক্ষা ছাড়া এমন শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা ‘পশু তৈরি করছে, মানুষ নয়’, যার প্রমাণ আবরারের নির্মম হত্যা। সোমবার (৬ অক্টোবর) জাতীয় প্রেস ক্লাবের আব্দুস সালাম হলে শহীদ আবরার ফাহাদ দিবস উপলক্ষ্যে জাতীয় গণতান্ত্রিক পার্টি (জাগপা) আয়োজিত ‘রুখে দাঁড়াও ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ’ শীর্ষক এক আলোচনা সভায় প্রধান বক্তা হিসেবে তিনি এসব কথা বলেন। আলোচনা সভায় সভাপতিত্ব করেন জাগপার সহ সভাপতি ও দলীয় মুখপাত্র রাশেদ প্রধান। মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, আবরার ফাহাদ কোনো ছাত্রসংগঠনের সঙ্গে যুক্ত ছিল না, সে ছিল একজন দেশপ্রেমিক মেধাবী ছাত্র। তিস্তার পানি, ফেনী নদী, গ্যাস এবং কলকাতার বন্দরের ইতিহাস নিয়ে ফেসবুকে ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে লেখালেখি করায় বুয়েট ছাত্রলীগের নেতাকর্মীরা তাকে নির্মমভাবে পিটিয়ে হত্যা করে। তিনি বলেন, সেরা বিদ্যাপীঠের মেধাবী ছাত্ররা এমন নৃশংস কাজ করতে পারে কীভাবে? এটি প্রমাণ করে তাদের মেধা, মনন, শিক্ষা ও চরিত্রে মানবতা নেই। জামায়াতের সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল বলেন, এখন আধিপত্যবাদ মানে শুধু ভৌগোলিক সীমানা বা দেশ দখল নয়। বরং এটি হলো এক দেশ অন্য দেশে বসে ‘রিমোট কন্ট্রোলের’ মাধ্যমে শাসক বসানো, রাজনীতি, অর্থনীতি, বাজার, পররাষ্ট্রনীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা। এ কারণেই বাংলাদেশ তিস্তা নদীর পানি পাচ্ছে না এবং নানাভাবে শোষিত হচ্ছে। দেশের বর্তমান রাজনৈতিক পরিস্থিতি ও আসন্ন নির্বাচন প্রসঙ্গে মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, জনগণের আকাঙ্ক্ষা পূরণের জন্য একটি নির্দলীয় অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের অধীনে অবাধ ও সুষ্ঠু নির্বাচন দরকার। বিদ্যমান রাষ্ট্র কাঠামোকে বদলে দিয়ে রাজনৈতিক ও সাংবিধানিক সংস্কারের মাধ্যমে নতুন একটি রাষ্ট্র কাঠামো গঠন করতে হবে। এ সংস্কারের মধ্য দিয়ে এমন একটি রাষ্ট্রযন্ত্র তৈরি হবে, যেখানে নতুন করে আর কোনো ফ্যাসিস্ট কিংবা হাসিনার জন্ম হবে না। তিনি বলেন, আসন্ন নির্বাচনে ইসলামী শক্তি ও দেশপ্রেমিক শক্তির মধ্যে যে সমঝোতার সম্ভাবনা দেখা দিয়েছে, কোনো আধিপত্যবাদী শক্তি যেন সেই ঐক্যের পথে বাধা সৃষ্টি না করতে পারে। পাশাপাশি ভারতের সঙ্গে সমতার ভিত্তিতে ও ন্যায্যতার মাধ্যমে সুসম্পর্ক বজায় রাখার ব্যবস্থা করতে হবে।",

        "body": "বাংলাদেশের মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় প্রথমবারের মতো দাখিল (এসএসসি সমমান) স্তরে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু হতে যাচ্ছে। আগামী শিক্ষাবর্ষ থেকেই দেশব্যাপী নির্দিষ্ট শর্তসাপেক্ষে মাদ্রাসাগুলোতে এই বিভাগ চালুর অনুমোদন দেবে বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ড। এরই মধ্যে নতুন কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপি চূড়ান্তকরণের কাজ চলছে। নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী, ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষেই ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর জন্য শতাধিক মাদ্রাসা আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ শিক্ষাবর্ষের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টির বেশি আবেদন। জানা গেছে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর উদ্যোগ এটি প্রথম নয়। এর আগে গত এক দশকে দুই দফায় এই প্রচেষ্টা নেওয়া হলেও তা বাস্তবে রূপ পায়নি। কর্মকর্তা ও নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, সরকারের অনীহা, প্রশাসনিক জটিলতা এবং নীতিগত অসহযোগিতার কারণে তৎকালীন সময়ে উদ্যোগটি থেমে যায়। বোর্ড সূত্রে জানা যায়, ২০১৪ সালের দিকে প্রথমবার ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর নীতিগত আলোচনা শুরু হয়। কিন্তু সে সময় শিক্ষানীতি বাস্তবায়ন নিয়ে অস্পষ্টতা, বাজেট সংকট এবং রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে বিষয়টি এগোয়নি। পরবর্তীতে ২০১৮ সালে দ্বিতীয়বার এই প্রস্তাব তোলা হলে পরিবর্তনশীল সরকারি অগ্রাধিকার এবং প্রশাসনিক সাড়া না পাওয়ায় উদ্যোগটি আবারও বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, তখন মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাকে মূলধারায় আনার কথা বলা হলেও কার্যকর পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়নি। শিক্ষক নিয়োগ, পাঠ্যপুস্তক তৈরি, কারিকুলাম অনুমোদন— প্রতিটি ধাপেই নানা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বাধা প্রকল্পটিকে স্থবির করে তোলে। তবে, বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি ভিন্ন বলে মনে করছেন সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তারা। নতুন শিক্ষা কাঠামো, দক্ষতাভিত্তিক শিক্ষার ওপর জোর এবং মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় কর্মমুখী বিষয় যুক্ত করার সরকারি আগ্রহের কারণে এবার উদ্যোগটি সফল হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা অনেক বেশি। তাদের মতে, এখন রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছা ও প্রশাসনিক সহযোগিতা থাকায় বাস্তবায়ন অগ্রগতিও দ্রুত হয়েছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের চেয়ারম্যান মিঞা মো. নূরুল হক ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিষয় চালুর নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত বাস্তবায়নে আন্তরিকভাবে চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। তবে, শুরুতে সব মাদ্রাসায় এর অনুমোদন মিলবে না। সেজন্য তিনটি শর্ত অবশ্যই পূরণ করতে হবে- প্রথমত, সংশ্লিষ্ট মাদ্রাসায় চলতি বছরে অষ্টম শ্রেণিতে ন্যূনতম ১০০ শিক্ষার্থী থাকতে হবে। দ্বিতীয়ত, পর্যাপ্ত ভৌত অবকাঠামো থাকতে হবে, যাতে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগের জন্য অন্তত দুটি অতিরিক্ত শ্রেণিকক্ষ চালু করলেও অন্যান্য ক্লাস ব্যাহত না হয়। তৃতীয়ত, এনটিআরসিএর মাধ্যমে শিক্ষক নিয়োগ না আসা পর্যন্ত মাদ্রাসার নিজস্ব তহবিল থেকে খণ্ডকালীন ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শিক্ষক নিয়োগ দেওয়ার সক্ষমতা থাকতে হবে। চেয়ারম্যান বলেন, ‘এই তিনটি মাপকাঠি (ক্রাইটেরিয়া) যাদের আছে এবং যারা আগ্রহী, কেবল তারাই আবেদন করতে পারবেন। বাস্তবতা দেখে পরবর্তীতে শর্ত শিথিল করার বিষয়টি বিবেচনা করা হবে।’ বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার দপ্তর বলছে, এরইমধ্যে ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ খোলার জন্য শতাধিক প্রতিষ্ঠান আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ সালের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টি মাদ্রাসার আবেদন। বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার অধ্যাপক ছালেহ আহমাদ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘বর্তমানে যুগের চাহিদার সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্য রেখে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রতি ব্যাপক আগ্রহ দেখা যাচ্ছে। আমরা চাই সংখ্যার চেয়ে মানের ওপর বেশি গুরুত্ব দিতে, যাতে শিক্ষার্থীরা ভবিষ্যতে জাতীয় অর্থনীতিতে দক্ষ মানবসম্পদ হিসেবে অবদান রাখতে পারে।’ তিনি বলেন, এসব আবেদন প্রাথমিকভাবে বাছাই করা হচ্ছে। সরেজমিন পরিদর্শনের মাধ্যমে প্রত্যেকটি প্রতিষ্ঠানের অবকাঠামো, শিক্ষক সংকট, শ্রেণিকক্ষ, ল্যাব সুবিধা এবং প্রশাসনিক সক্ষমতা যাচাই করা হবে। নীতিমালা অনুযায়ী শর্ত পূরণ হলেই কেবল পর্যায়ক্রমে অনুমোদন দেওয়া হবে। এজন্য বোর্ড সর্বোচ্চ স্বচ্ছতা, জবাবদিহি ও মাননিয়ন্ত্রণ নিশ্চিত করেই অনুমোদনের প্রক্রিয়া সম্পন্ন করবে বলেও মন্তব্য করেন তিনি। অন্যদিকে বোর্ড কর্মকর্তারা বলছেন, যুগোপযোগী শিক্ষার বিস্তারে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করা অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কারণ দেশে ব্যাংকিং, হিসাবরক্ষণ, ব্যবসায় ব্যবস্থাপনা, উদ্যোক্তা উন্নয়ন ও ইসলামী অর্থনীতি— এসব ক্ষেত্রে দক্ষ জনশক্তির চাহিদা বাড়ছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীরা এত দিন এই মূলধারার সুযোগ থেকে বেশিরভাগই বঞ্চিত ছিল। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের কারিকুলাম বিশেষজ্ঞ ড. মোহাম্মদ হেদায়েত উল্লাহ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘আলিয়া মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শাখা চালুর জন্য কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপির চূড়ান্তকরণ এখন শেষ পর্যায়ে। নতুন বইগুলোর প্রায় ৯৫ শতাংশ সাধারণ স্কুল–কলেজের ব্যবসায় শিক্ষার বইয়ের মতোই হবে। তবে ইসলামী অর্থনীতি, সুদের ধারণা, নৈতিক ব্যবসা পরিচালনা ও শরিয়াহভিত্তিক বাণিজ্যব্যবস্থা— এসব অতিরিক্ত বিষয় যুক্ত করা হয়েছে।’ তিনি আরও বলেন, ‘ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রক্রিয়াটি দীর্ঘদিন ধরেই চলমান। আগেও দুবার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছিল, কিন্তু নীতিগত ও কাঠামোগত নানা কারণে তা বাস্তবায়িত হয়নি। এবার সরকার পরিবর্তনের পর নতুন করে নীতিগত অগ্রাধিকারে এই উদ্যোগ দ্রুত এগোচ্ছে। মাদ্রাসার শিক্ষার্থীরা এর ফলে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক দক্ষতার পথে বড় সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘বছরের শুরুতেই নতুন বিভাগে পাঠদান শুরু করার প্রস্তুতি নেওয়া হচ্ছে। প্রয়োজন হলে ফেব্রুয়ারি পর্যন্ত অতিরিক্ত সময় নিয়ে বই পৌঁছানো হবে। তবে, পরবর্তী শিক্ষাবর্ষে পাঠ্যবইগুলো আরও আধুনিকায়ন করা হবে’— বলেন ড. হেদায়েতুল্লাহ। অন্যদিকে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করতে সরকারের এমন সিদ্ধান্তকে বড় পরিবর্তনের উদ্যোগ হিসেবে দেখছেন মাদ্রাসাপ্রধানরা। তারা বলছেন, বর্তমান চাহিদা অনুযায়ী এমন সিদ্ধান্ত সময়োপযোগী ও যুগান্তকারী। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য কর্মমুখী শিক্ষার সুযোগ সৃষ্টির দাবি ছিল। ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর ফলে এখন আমাদের শিক্ষার্থীরা বিজ্ঞান ও মানবিক শাখার পাশাপাশি আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞান লাভ করে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে সরাসরি অবদান রাখতে পারবে। এই উদ্যোগ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার প্রতি সাধারণ মানুষের আগ্রহ আরও বাড়িয়ে তুলবে। ময়মনসিংহের কাতলাসেন কাদেরিয়া কামিল মাদ্রাসার অধ্যক্ষ দেলোয়ার হোসেন আজিজী ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘এটি আমাদের জন্য একটি বিশাল সুযোগ। এত দিন মাদ্রাসার ছাত্রদের জন্য কর্মসংস্থান ও উচ্চশিক্ষার ক্ষেত্র কিছুটা সীমিত ছিল। নতুন এই বিভাগ চালু হওয়ায় শিক্ষার্থীরা এখন ব্যাংক, বীমা, কর্পোরেট হাউজসহ বিভিন্ন ব্যবসায়িক প্রতিষ্ঠানে নিজেদের ক্যারিয়ার গড়ার সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘আমরা আশা করি, তারা ইসলামী মূল্যবোধ ও নৈতিকতার সঙ্গে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞানের সমন্বয় ঘটিয়ে সৎ ও যোগ্য উদ্যোক্তা হিসেবে সমাজে নিজেদের প্রতিষ্ঠিত করতে সক্ষম হবে’— মনে করেন এই অধ্যক্ষ।",

        "body": "বাংলাদেশের মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় প্রথমবারের মতো দাখিল (এসএসসি সমমান) স্তরে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু হতে যাচ্ছে। আগামী শিক্ষাবর্ষ থেকেই দেশব্যাপী নির্দিষ্ট শর্তসাপেক্ষে মাদ্রাসাগুলোতে এই বিভাগ চালুর অনুমোদন দেবে বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ড। এরই মধ্যে নতুন কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপি চূড়ান্তকরণের কাজ চলছে। নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী, ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষেই ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর জন্য শতাধিক মাদ্রাসা আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ শিক্ষাবর্ষের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টির বেশি আবেদন। জানা গেছে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর উদ্যোগ এটি প্রথম নয়। এর আগে গত এক দশকে দুই দফায় এই প্রচেষ্টা নেওয়া হলেও তা বাস্তবে রূপ পায়নি। কর্মকর্তা ও নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, সরকারের অনীহা, প্রশাসনিক জটিলতা এবং নীতিগত অসহযোগিতার কারণে তৎকালীন সময়ে উদ্যোগটি থেমে যায়। বোর্ড সূত্রে জানা যায়, ২০১৪ সালের দিকে প্রথমবার ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর নীতিগত আলোচনা শুরু হয়। কিন্তু সে সময় শিক্ষানীতি বাস্তবায়ন নিয়ে অস্পষ্টতা, বাজেট সংকট এবং রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে বিষয়টি এগোয়নি। পরবর্তীতে ২০১৮ সালে দ্বিতীয়বার এই প্রস্তাব তোলা হলে পরিবর্তনশীল সরকারি অগ্রাধিকার এবং প্রশাসনিক সাড়া না পাওয়ায় উদ্যোগটি আবারও বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, তখন মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাকে

        "body": "French president Emmanuel Macron was on Thursday racing to find a new prime minister within a two-day deadline after the resignation of outgoing premier Sebastien Lecornu tipped the country deeper into political crisis. The presidency said late Wednesday that Macron would name a new prime minister within the next 48 hours, indicating the appointment would come by Friday evening at the latest. A declaration seemed unlikely on Thursday, with foreign ministers in Paris for talks on plans to help Palestinians after the Gaza war, then Macron due to attend a ceremony in the evening honouring a late justice minister who ended capital punishment. An announcement of a new prime minister looked more likely on Friday, and could even include a cabinet lineup, a source close to the president said. Lecornu told French television in an interview on Wednesday evening that he expected a new premier to be named — rather than early legislative elections or Macron’s resignation — in order to resolve the crisis. Unless Lecornu is reappointed, the new prime minister will be the eighth of Macron’s presidency. Lecornu resigned early Monday after less than a month in office but Macron gave him up to Wednesday evening to find a way out of months of deadlock over an austerity budget. Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. The president ‘will name a prime minister within 48 hours’, the presidency said, adding a ‘path was possible’ to agree a budget by the end of the year. The escalation of the crisis has turned into the worst political headache for Macron since he came to office in 2017, with close allies deserting a head of state who now appears increasingly isolated. Former prime minister Edouard Philippe said that Macron himself should step down and call snap presidential polls. But Lecornu insisted the president should serve out his mandate until 2027, saying it was ‘not the time to change the president’. Suggesting that a more technocratic government could be named, Lecornu said people in a new cabinet should not have ‘ambitions’ to stand in the 2027 presidential elections. ‘We need a team that decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country’s problems until the presidential election,’ he said. Rumours swirled on Thursday on who could be prime minister. A person close to the president said Jean-Louis Borloo, a former minister under right-wing presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, could be a potential candidate. But the 74-year-old centrist said he had heard nothing of it and had ‘zero’ contact with the president’s office. Whoever is named the new prime minister will likely face the same problems encountered by Lecornu and his two immediate predecessors, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou, who were both toppled by parliament. After losing their majority in 2022 elections and ceding even more seats in snap polls last year, Macron’s centrists have governed in a de facto coalition with the right-wing Republicans. But even this combination is a minority in parliament, and any premier risks being voted out again if the left teams up with the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. Le Pen said Wednesday she would thwart all action by any new government and would ‘vote against everything’. Le Pen’s anti-immigration party senses its best ever chance of winning power in the 2027 presidential elections, with Macron barred from running having served two terms. Critical to its hopes of survival could be the Socialists, who Macron has long tried to woo away from a broad left-wing alliance. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure emerged from a meeting with Lecornu earlier Wednesday, lamenting that the premier had ‘given no assurance’ on a key request, that a hotly contested 2023 pension reform would be suspended.",

        "body": "The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has directed its investigation agency and prosecution to complete their probe and submit a report within two months against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina and 24 others in a case involving crimes against humanity and mass killings during a Hefazat-e-Islam rally at Shapla Chattar in 2013. A two-member bench of International Crimes Tribunal-1, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, issued the order today (5 February), setting 5 April as the deadline for submitting the investigation report. Earlier, 5 February had been fixed for the submission of the report. However, Prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim sought an additional two months to complete the investigation. Following political changes in the country on 5 August 2024 and the subsequent reconstitution of the tribunal, Hefazat-e-Islam leader Azizul Haque filed a complaint with the chief prosecutor over the 5 May 2013 incident. He lodged the complaint on behalf of Hefazat leaders Junaid Al Habib and Maulana Mamunul Haque. Earlier in the day, 5 arrested accused were produced before the tribunal. They are former state minister for home affairs Shamsul Haque Tuku, former army officer Major General Ziaul Ahsan, former former inspector general of police (IGP) AKM Shahidul Haque, former deputy inspector general (DIG) Molla Nazrul Islam, and Shahriar Kabir, president of the advisory council of the Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee.

        "title": "Chairman proposes, minister opposes",
        "body": "Less than a week after the announcement that he would welcome newsmen at all meetings of the parliamentary bodies he heads, Suranjit Sengupta had to face strong opposition yesterday from a minister who is a member of the committee he chairs. The minister opposed Sengupta on two grounds - procedural as well as practical problems. While giving a lecture on the need for transparency in parliamentary activities, Sengupta announced on January 7 last: \"From now on, I welcome newsmen at all meetings of the parliamentary committees I head.\" Sengupta is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. The committee met yesterday afternoon. Some reporters did not fail to be present at the venue. But contrary to Sengupta's public announcement, meeting of the JS body began only after the reporters had left the room at the request of the legislators concerned. Law Minister Abdul Matin Khashru argued that there was no scope for inviting newsmen at the committee meetings \"unless certain provisions of the JS Rules of Procedure - the Bible for parliamentary practices - are changed\". He quoted a couple of rules - 199 and 201 - which do not support Sengupta's view. Rule 199 of the JS Rules of Procedure says: The sittings of a Committee shall be held in private. Rule 201 says: All persons other than members of the Committee and officers of the Parliament Secretariat shall withdraw whenever the committee is delivering. Sengupta, however, tried to take refuge in Rule 213 (I) that says: A committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure. Explaining, Sengupta said that the rule empowered a committee to independently decide as to how it would function. But the minister did not take time to interpret the rule in a different manner. Quoting the second part of the rule, the minister said that the rule actually empowered the committee to invite experts, not journalists. Rule 213 (II) says, \"A committee may obtain cooperation and advice from any expert in its respective field, if deemed necessary.\" The minister \"welcomed\" Sengupta's spirit of making the committee activities more transparent. But he said, \"If the meetings are open to journalists, I am afraid, the present level of effectiveness of the committee meetings would be affected. May be, it will inspire many of us to play to the gallery, rather than concentrate on the issues to be discussed at the meeting.\" He however told the meeting that journalists could be invited to attend some \"selective\" meetings, not all. Barrister Jamiruddin Sircar, a BNP member on the committee, believes that the meetings of the JS bodies, especially the one dealing with the judiciary, should be open for all. On the question of the restriction as stated by the minister, Sircar said: \"The rules are not mandatory. Those are rather directory.\" However, the issue remained unresolved. A senior ruling party member on the committee, Advocate Rahmat Ali, suggested that the Speaker be consulted on the controversial issue. Meanwhile, the committee members present at the meeting reached a consensus that senior lawyers having good reputation could be appointed High Court judges on temporary basis. \"It will help fight the back-log of cases pending trial in the High Court,\" the Law Minister told The Daily Star yesterday evening. \"However, the appointments will be made if the Chief Justice agrees to the proposition. Besides, we will seek opinion of other experts.\"",

        "title": "Opposition lawmakers slam health minister for ‘failure’ to tackle Covid-19",
        "body": "Some lawmakers of opposition parties in parliament have come down heavily on Health Minister Zahid Maleque, claiming that his ministry has failed to tackle the coronavirus situation. The parliament was heated up on Tuesday while the opposition lawmakers in the house discussed their cut-motions regarding Tk22,883.86-crore demand in grant for the Health Services Division. The members of parliament of the opposition parties blamed the health minister for the dire state of the country's heath sector and some even demanded his removal from the office, reports the Prothom Alo. Jatiya Party Mujibul Haque (Kishoreganj-3) said had the health ministry taken any effective action to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the situation would not have turned so critical in the country. The personal protective equipment (PPE) given to the doctors and nurses are of low quality, he added. Criticising the services provided by public hospitals, he asked the prime minister to issue a directive so that no minister, MP and government official can receive treatment from hospitals other than the government ones, reports UNB. Mujibul Haque demanded that the private hospitals be brought under accountability too. BNP lawmaker Harunur Rashid (Chapainawabganj-3) claimed that the Covid-19 infection rate in Bangladesh is the highest in the world, but the country is carrying out a small number of tests every day. He said, \"It is a big weakness in our health sector that we have various infrastructures in government hospitals at division, district and upazila levels, but the number of technologists is so limited that people who go to the hospitals for treatment after 12:00 pm, do not get tested.\" \"Therefore, the number of technologists will have to be increased so that poor people can avail 24-hour testing facilities,\" Harun said. The BNP lawmaker said there is no way to deny the fact that Bangladesh's entire medical system has become dependent on India. \"In the last 10 years, over one crore people went to India for treatment,\" he said. Jatiya Party Lawmaker Pir Fazlur Rahman (Sunamganj-4) urged the prime minister to replace incumbent Health Minister Zahid Maleque with Begum Matia Chowdhury. \"The people of my constituency asked me to place it [their desire] before the prime minister,\" he said. Another Jatiya Party lawmaker Shameem Haider Patwary (Gaibandha-1), demanded that a basic health database for all citizens in the country be prepared and enough medical technologists be recruited. Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Firoz Rashid (Dhaka-6) said there is no coordination between the ministry and the Directorate General of Health Services to deal with the coronavirus crisis. Rowshan Ara Mannan (Women Seat-47) said the health sector should be given the highest priory to deal with the situation. In response, the health minister highlighted the various steps taken by his ministry and claimed that he was in the field, reports the Prothom Alo. Responding to the allegations of irregularities in hotels and food costs of doctors and health workers at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the minister said the allegations were not correct as some 3,700 people stayed there in 50 hotels for a month, and Tk500 per person was given as food cost for three meals a day – breakfast, lunch and dinner. \"The rent for each room was Tk1,100 per day.\" Noting that the costs were not so high, he said, \"The food cost that was said [in allegation] is not correct.\" Zahid Maleque said there is now no allegation about the standard of the PPE. The government has already sent 30 lakh sets of PPE to different hospitals, reports UNB. He said now every private hospital is providing medical treatment though their service charges are high to some extent. \"The government will fix service charges.\" The minister said there was an outcry for ventilators initially, but now it seems there is no need for that. \"We have some 400 ventilators. But, 50 of those are not used. Most of the patients put under ventilator support died.\" He said the Covid-19 death rate among the infected people is low due to the measures taken by the government. The government has recruited some 2,000 doctors and 6,000 nurses within a quick time to deliver medical services to corona patients, increased the number of hotlines to 50 from five, introduced telemedicine services, prepared patient guidelines, a modern protocol for doctors and other health workers, he said, reports UNB. The minister said 14,000 beds have been designated for Covid-19 patients in the country's hospitals and 40 percent of those are still vacant, reports UNB. \"It is not like that patients are not getting treatment in any hospital of Bangladesh. As of today, we have 60 percent beds occupied while 40 percent are still vacant. We have some 14,000 beds for Covid-19 patients,\" he said. The health minister also said that high-flow oxygen lines are essential for Covid-19 patients. So, the government has taken the initiative for arranging 1,000 high-flow oxygen systems and 10,000 new oxygen cylinders.

Replying to a question by CPI(M) MP John Brittas in the Rajya Sabha yesterday (29 January), he said India has consistently raised the matter of safety and security of the minorities with the authorities in Bangladesh, at both political and diplomatic levels on several occasions. The issue was raised by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his meeting with Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus on 4 April 2025 and by the External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his meeting with Foreign Advisor Touhid Hossain on 16 February last year, Singh said. The issue has also been discussed during relevant discussions with other foreign interlocutors, he added. According to Singh, \"it is the expectation of the government of India that the interim government of Bangladesh will discharge its responsibilities by thoroughly investigating these incidents and bring all perpetrators of killings, arson and violence against minorities to justice without excuses.\" \"The primary responsibility for the protection of life and liberty of all citizens of Bangladesh, including minorities, rests with the government of Bangladesh,\" the minister said. Brittas asked four questions whether the Indian government has taken cognisance of reports of attacks, killings, arson and intimidation targeting minorities in Bangladesh and the deterioration of law and order; the number and details of formal representations made by India to the government of Bangladesh on protection of minorities during the last two years; whether these concerns were raised at the political or diplomatic level and Bangladesh's response thereto and whether India proposes to seek concrete assurances or international monitoring to ensure the safety of minorities in Bangladesh.

He said: \"It is very unfortunate that the opposition leader has categorically rejected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's offer to resolve the political standoff through dialogue, leaving no option for the government to explore.\" Dr Malek said there had been the possibility of enshrining parliamentary democracy in the country when Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina assumed office after winning people's mandate in free and fair general elections on June 12, 1996. \"But a certain quarter became active to foil parliamentary democracy as soon as Sheikh Hasina took office,\" he said, adding, \"Begum Zia threatened to oust the present government just 90 days after it assumed power.\" Dr Malek called upon the intellectuals not to hesitate to protect democracy at a time when opposition political parties are mapping out a sinister blueprint to destroy it. The discussion was also addressed by Chairman of Public Administration Reform Commission (PARC) A T M Shamsul Huq, General Secretary of Sangsadia Ganotantra Parishad Dr Harun-ur-Rashid, Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University Dr A K Azad Chowdhury, Pro-Vice Chancellor Mohammad Shahadat Ali, Dr Shamsul Huda Harun, Prof Ali Asgar, Prof Imamul Huq, Prof Mejbauddin Ahmed, Chairman of Bangladesh Muktijodda Central Command Council Principal Ahad Chowdhury, and President of Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalist (BFUJ) Abul Kalam Azad.

Criticising opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia for her declaration that hartal will be used to create a deadlock, Justice Sobhan said the people will pay eventually for such actions. He also questioned the logic of the anti-government movement of the opposition. Dr Shamsul Huda Harun said, \"No government would be able to run the country, if the opposition does not play its due role in a parliamentary democracy.\"",

The Foreign Adviser made the remarks as foreign diplomats stationed in Dhaka visited the museum on Monday, days before its opening to the public. Cultural Affairs Adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki briefed the diplomats and guided them through the museum's key sections. Senior Secretary and SDGs Affairs Principal Coordinator Lamiya Morshed, Foreign Secretary Asad Alam Siam, and Cultural Affairs Secretary Md Mofidur Rahman were also present. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 29 January wrote to all diplomatic missions, UN agencies and offices of international organisations in Dhaka, inviting Ambassadors, High Commissioners, CDAs and heads of international organisations and UN agencies to join the museum tour, a senior official at the ministry told UNB. Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam and Deputy Press Secretary Abul Kalam Azad Majumder have joined the programme. Earlier, on 20 January, Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus visited the museum. Gonobhaban, the former residence of 'ousted autocrat' Sheikh Hasina, has been converted into the July Museum, which is set for soft opening next week, said the Chief Adviser's press wing. At the start of a two-hour-long visit, the diplomats observed a minute of silence in memory of the nearly 4000 people who were martyred during the fascist regime of Sheikh Hasina. Farooki said the July Museum would collaborate with similar institutions in other countries. \"The idea behind the museum is to prevent the recurrence of such misrule, not only in Bangladesh, but anywhere in the world,\" he said. Chief Curator of the July Museum, Tanzim Wahab, described the various features of the museum to the visiting diplomats and guests. \"I am delighted to have visited the July Museum. It is both inspiring and a powerful reminder of how important it is to understand history, how mass uprisings occur, and the genesis of the 2024 mass uprising in Bangladesh,\" said Michael Miller, Ambassador and Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Bangladesh.

        "body": "Effective implementation of the ‘One Health’ approach requires coordinated commitment at the highest level among the ministries of Health and Family Welfare, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and Fisheries and Livestock, Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter said on Wednesday. “One Health is not just a subject for speeches. It demands real commitment, policy-level decisions and a collective mindset to work together. The era of fragmented efforts is over; now we need a ‘whole-of-government’ and ‘whole-of-nation’ approach,” she said while chairing a seminar titled ‘One Health Activities: Opportunities, Challenges and Future Strategies’, organised by the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock at a city hotel. The adviser said human health, animal health and the environment are deeply interconnected, and only through their integration can One Health be implemented in its true sense. She noted that while humans are victims of diseases, they are often also responsible for their spread. Unsafe food, environmental pollution, excessive use of antibiotics and unplanned urbanisation are increasing health risks, which must be addressed by prioritising preventive and primary healthcare. Farida Akhter said climate change, genetic diseases, food security and public health issues are closely linked. In this context, a decision has been taken to implement the proposed One Health initiative through a single DPP involving all three ministries, with three project directors to ensure active participation from each sector. Expressing optimism, she said Bangladesh would successfully implement the One Health initiative by considering human health, livestock, fisheries and the environment together, setting an effective example for others. Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan said development planning must place environment, biodiversity and public health at its core, stressing the need for integrated and forward-looking decisions. She said while roads or infrastructure can be built, natural assets such as the Sundarbans or rivers cannot be recreated once destroyed. Climate change, pandemics and environmental crises repeatedly remind us that every element of nature is deeply interconnected, and humans are not owners of nature but an inseparable part of it. The environment adviser also pointed out that procedural complexities, weak inter-ministerial coordination and delays in decision-making are major obstacles to implementing One Health activities. To overcome these challenges, she stressed the need for effective advisory committees at national and district levels, along with clearly defined focal points in each ministry. Special Assistant to the Chief Adviser on Health and Family Welfare Prof Dr Md Sayedur Rahman said human health must remain at the centre of the One Health concept. He said the importance of fish, livestock and environmental health ultimately lies in their impact on human health, food security and livelihoods, as food contamination, unsafe animal feed and environmental changes eventually affect people. Describing the proposed One Health project as an ‘eye-opening’ initiative for Bangladesh, the special assistant said its goal is to build the capacity to detect health risks early and respond in a timely manner by viewing humans, animals and nature through a single lens.",

One of them is to take steps against any form of corruption or irregularity if I get scope,” he told journalists during an introductory meeting with the ministry officials at its conference room at the Secretariat. Adviser Asif Nazrul was appointed to lead the Youth and Sports Ministry after the resignation of its adviser Asif Mahmud. Asif Nazrul said he was supposed to take charge on his first day with great enthusiasm and interest. “But now I could not say I am assuming responsibility with a joyful mind due to the shooting of Osman Hadi and the overall situation prevailing in the country afterward.” The adviser praised his predecessor Asif Mahmud saying he was a very successful adviser who did a lot of work, especially in the sports sector. He said the country has achieved several rare successes in sports under Asif Mahmud’s leadership that had not been achieved before. The adviser also mentioned the Youth Festival Fair as a very good programme and said he would maintain the continuity of the work done earlier while also looking into what new initiatives could be taken. He said he would try to activate stadiums outside Dhaka as well as various offices of the ministry in different districts.",

        "title": "Macron seeks new PM to end France crisis",
        "body": "French president Emmanuel Macron was on Thursday racing to find a new prime minister within a two-day deadline after the resignation of outgoing premier Sebastien Lecornu tipped the country deeper into political crisis. The presidency said late Wednesday that Macron would name a new prime minister within the next 48 hours, indicating the appointment would come by Friday evening at the latest. A declaration seemed unlikely on Thursday, with foreign ministers in Paris for talks on plans to help Palestinians after the Gaza war, then Macron due to attend a ceremony in the evening honouring a late justice minister who ended capital punishment. An announcement of a new prime minister looked more likely on Friday, and could even include a cabinet lineup, a source close to the president said. Lecornu told French television in an interview on Wednesday evening that he expected a new premier to be named — rather than early legislative elections or Macron’s resignation — in order to resolve the crisis. Unless Lecornu is reappointed, the new prime minister will be the eighth of Macron’s presidency. Lecornu resigned early Monday after less than a month in office but Macron gave him up to Wednesday evening to find a way out of months of deadlock over an austerity budget. Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. The president ‘will name a prime minister within 48 hours’, the presidency said, adding a ‘path was possible’ to agree a budget by the end of the year. The escalation of the crisis has turned into the worst political headache for Macron since he came to office in 2017, with close allies deserting a head of state who now appears increasingly isolated. Former prime minister Edouard Philippe said that Macron himself should step down and call snap presidential polls. But Lecornu insisted the president should serve out his mandate until 2027, saying it was ‘not the time to change the president’. Suggesting that a more technocratic government could be named, Lecornu said people in a new cabinet should not have ‘ambitions’ to stand in the 2027 presidential elections. ‘We need a team that decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country’s problems until the presidential election,’ he said. Rumours swirled on Thursday on who could be prime minister. A person close to the president said Jean-Louis Borloo, a former minister under right-wing presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, could be a potential candidate. But the 74-year-old centrist said he had heard nothing of it and had ‘zero’ contact with the president’s office. Whoever is named the new prime minister will likely face the same problems encountered by Lecornu and his two immediate predecessors, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou, who were both toppled by parliament. After losing their majority in 2022 elections and ceding even more seats in snap polls last year, Macron’s centrists have governed in a de facto coalition with the right-wing Republicans. But even this combination is a minority in parliament, and any premier risks being voted out again if the left teams up with the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. Le Pen said Wednesday she would thwart all action by any new government and would ‘vote against everything’. Le Pen’s anti-immigration party senses its best ever chance of winning power in the 2027 presidential elections, with Macron barred from running having served two terms. Critical to its hopes of survival could be the Socialists, who Macron has long tried to woo away from a broad left-wing alliance. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure emerged from a meeting with Lecornu earlier Wednesday, lamenting that the premier had ‘given no assurance’ on a key request, that a hotly contested 2023 pension reform would be suspended.",

        "body": "Former President Abdur Rahman Biswas yesterday said that during his presidency, his speeches in the Parliament were endorsed by the Prime Minister and her office. Talking to UNB in the wake of a controversy kicked up by the opposition over the issue, he said, his presidential speeches used to contain two parts - objective and subjective. The objective part, mainly containing accounts of various development programmes and achievements of the government, was prepared by different ministries, while the subjective one, on matters like one Liberation War, contribution of national leaders to democracy and independence, was drafted by the President's Office. \"However, finally the entire speech of the President used to be seen and cleared by the Prime Minister and her office,\" said Biswas, who was president from 1991-96 and was elected as a BNP nominee. The former president said he found nothing wrong in the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, endorsing the draft speech. Biswas, however, said that any additions or omissions from the draft speech were done on the basis of understanding between the head of state and the head of government. Biswas declined to make any comment on the opposition boycott of his successor's speech, delivered in Parliament yesterday, on objection that it was endorsed by the cabinet eulogising the government's programmes and performances. Praising President Shahabuddin Ahmed as a neutral and respected man, Biswas said Shahabuddin was accepted by all. \"Even BNP gladly accepted him although he was nominated by Awami League.\" Asked to comment on whether a president could make his personal comments aside the scripted address to the Parliament, Biswas said as a matter of fact the President has nothing to say in addition to the prepared speech cleared by the Prime Minister and the cabinet. As per the present Constitution, the President is to act on advice of the Prime Minister, excepting imitating the leader of the majority party in forming government and giving appointment to the Chief Justice and to other constitutional posts. Biswas, however, recalled that while addressing the first session of the 6th Parliament, elected through a controversial election on February 15, 1996, as President he made certain comments which were little critical of BNP. And those comments earned protests from the BNP government as well. \"BNP had raised objection to certain parts of that speech, but I insisted that those points should be there,\" said the former President. About the opposition boycott of municipal elections, Biswas refrained from making comment since he is no longer in active politics. \"It is difficult on my part to comment since I was associated with a political party,\" Biswas said on the opposition boycott of President Shahabuddin Ahmed's speech in the first Parliament session of this year. He, however, suggested that both the ruling and opposition parties should close the gap and settle all differences through discussion. \"Otherwise, parliamentary democracy would fail,\" he forewarned. \"I love to call a spade a spade. Had I been in active politics, I would have suggested that both the government and opposition should thrash out the differences because democracy means discussion and settling all differences.\" The former President added: \"It would not be good to push the country towards a stalemate.\"",

        "title": "Macron seeks new PM to end France crisis",
        "body": "French president Emmanuel Macron was on Thursday racing to find a new prime minister within a two-day deadline after the resignation of outgoing premier Sebastien Lecornu tipped the country deeper into political crisis. The presidency said late Wednesday that Macron would name a new prime minister within the next 48 hours, indicating the appointment would come by Friday evening at the latest. A declaration seemed unlikely on Thursday, with foreign ministers in Paris for talks on plans to help Palestinians after the Gaza war, then Macron due to attend a ceremony in the evening honouring a late justice minister who ended capital punishment. An announcement of a new prime minister looked more likely on Friday, and could even include a cabinet lineup, a source close to the president said. Lecornu told French television in an interview on Wednesday evening that he expected a new premier to be named — rather than early legislative elections or Macron’s resignation — in order to resolve the crisis. Unless Lecornu is reappointed, the new prime minister will be the eighth of Macron’s presidency. Lecornu resigned early Monday after less than a month in office but Macron gave him up to Wednesday evening to find a way out of months of deadlock over an austerity budget. Lecornu’s two immediate predecessors were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. The president ‘will name a prime minister within 48 hours’, the presidency said, adding a ‘path was possible’ to agree a budget by the end of the year. The escalation of the crisis has turned into the worst political headache for Macron since he came to office in 2017, with close allies deserting a head of state who now appears increasingly isolated. Former prime minister Edouard Philippe said that Macron himself should step down and call snap presidential polls. But Lecornu insisted the president should serve out his mandate until 2027, saying it was ‘not the time to change the president’. Suggesting that a more technocratic government could be named, Lecornu said people in a new cabinet should not have ‘ambitions’ to stand in the 2027 presidential elections. ‘We need a team that decides to roll up its sleeves and solve the country’s problems until the presidential election,’ he said. Rumours swirled on Thursday on who could be prime minister. A person close to the president said Jean-Louis Borloo, a former minister under right-wing presidents Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, could be a potential candidate. But the 74-year-old centrist said he had heard nothing of it and had ‘zero’ contact with the president’s office. Whoever is named the new prime minister will likely face the same problems encountered by Lecornu and his two immediate predecessors, Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou, who were both toppled by parliament. After losing their majority in 2022 elections and ceding even more seats in snap polls last year, Macron’s centrists have governed in a de facto coalition with the right-wing Republicans. But even this combination is a minority in parliament, and any premier risks being voted out again if the left teams up with the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. Le Pen said Wednesday she would thwart all action by any new government and would ‘vote against everything’. Le Pen’s anti-immigration party senses its best ever chance of winning power in the 2027 presidential elections, with Macron barred from running having served two terms. Critical to its hopes of survival could be the Socialists, who Macron has long tried to woo away from a broad left-wing alliance. But Socialist leader Olivier Faure emerged from a meeting with Lecornu earlier Wednesday, lamenting that the premier had ‘given no assurance’ on a key request, that a hotly contested 2023 pension reform would be suspended.",

She issued the instruction from a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) on Tuesday. The prime minister presided over the Ecnec meeting virtually while other ministers and officials joined it at the National Economic Council Auditorium in Dhaka. Planning Minister MA Mannan briefed the media after emerging from the meeting. He said the prime minister instructed all units of local governments, including city corporations, to be solvent financially. \"Local governments provide services to the people.

The minister also said the government is organising major meetings virtually, which has reduced entertainment costs. A ban has also been imposed on buying cars with government funds till December next. He added that there is a big scope to reduce the misuse of government funds and that the prime minister has directed them to reduce costs for cars, accommodation, procurement, entertainment and foreign tours.

        "body": "India prime minister Narendra Modi met with Canada foreign minister in New Delhi on Monday. ‘India-Canada bilateral relations have been steadily progressing in the last few months,’ Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand, after her meeting with Modi. ‘When we look at Canada, we see a complementary economy, we see another open society... that is the basis for a close, sustainable and long term cooperative framework,’ Jaishankar said in brief comments broadcast by the foreign ministry. Relations had deteriorated following Canadian accusations that New Delhi was involved in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh leader – claims India denied. The diplomatic rift severely disrupted consular and trade services between the nations, which exchanged about $9 billion in goods and services in 2023. Relations have improved since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took office in March. Carney met Modi in June, on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Canada, where they agreed to name new high commissioners, as ambassadors are known between Commonwealth nations. Both envoys have since begun work. With US President Donald Trump upending global trade, both India and Canada have been much more agreeable about working together. Anand is also expected to meet India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal and meet business leaders in the financial capital Mumbai. Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside India. That community includes activists for ‘Khalistan’, a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority. Ottawa accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan campaigner, and targeting other Sikh activists connected to the movement. The Khalistan campaign dates to India’s 1947 independence and has been blamed for the assassination of a prime minister and the bombing of a passenger jet. It has been a bitter issue between India and several Western nations with large Sikh populations.",

        "body": "Hundreds of women protested in Mexico City on Tuesday against gender-based violence, which kills an average of 10 women or girls every day in Mexico, according to official data. Mexican lawyer Alejandra Perez said she lives in fear every day since the violence she faced from her ex-partner temporarily left her disabled. But the 37-year-old summoned the courage to join the protest to denounce the impunity of many perpetrators of gender-based violence in Mexico, and marched holding a poster showing the man she accuses of attacking her. ‘I filed a complaint against him three years ago, and this man is still at large,’ she said of her daughter’s father. ‘The system is very slow. Unfortunately many women have to conduct their own investigations.’ The United Nations reports that 70 per cent of Mexican women over the age of 15 have experienced some form of aggression at least once in their lives. Mexican parliamentary records indicate 3,430 women died violent deaths in Mexico in 2024, with 829 victims of femicide, a crime defined as murder motivated by a victim’s gender. Mexico is experiencing a wave of feminist fervour fuelled by anger over the high number of assaults and the impunity of perpetrators. President Claudia Sheinbaum recently launched a nationwide drive against sexual harassment and abuse, after a shocking video of a man groping her brought the widespread issue into stark focus. The country’s first woman leader presented a plan to ensure prison sentences for sexual abuse across Mexico and to encourage women to report incidents to police. The 63-year-old leader was accosted as she walked through Mexico City when a seemingly drunk man put his arm around her shoulder, touched her hip and chest, and attempted to kiss her neck, before a member of the president’s security detail pulled him away.",

        "body": "Hong Kong's opposition camp set up polling booths across the Chinese-ruled city on Saturday for primary elections aimed at selecting democracy candidates who stand the best chance of success in Legislative Council elections in September. The primaries come less than two weeks after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on the Asian financial hub, stoking concerns that wide-ranging freedoms not seen in mainland China will be crushed. The law punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison and allows mainland security agents to operate officially in Hong Kong for the first time. On the eve of the primaries, police searched the office of independent pollster Robert Chung, whose Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) helps organise the election, raising concerns among activists of interference in the poll. \"The primary election is our first time to let Beijing know Hong Kongers never bow down to China,\" said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong ahead of the opening of polling booths at noon (0400 GMT). \"We urge the world to put Hong Kong under the global spotlight.\" While the primaries are only for the opposition camp, observers are watching closely as they say the turnout at the election will serve as a litmus test of broader opposition to the national security law. The election seeks to bolster the chance for democracy candidates to achieve a 35-plus majority in the 70-seat legislature in polls on September 6, potentially giving them power to block government proposals. Hong Kong's opposition camp secured a landslide victory in district council elections in November, riding on support for an anti-government protest movement triggered by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. Protests that escalated in June last year and evolved into calls for greater democracy have fizzled since police arrested more than 300 people on July 1, the day after Beijing introduced the national security law.",

        "title": "Hong Kong man accused of terrorism in first use of new China security law",
        "body": "A man carrying a \"Liberate Hong Kong\" sign as he drove a motorcycle into police at a protest against the territory's Chinese rulers became on Friday the first person charged with inciting separatism and terrorism under a new security law. Beijing imposed the legislation on the former British colony earlier this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track. Critics say the law - which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - is aimed at crushing dissent and a long-running campaign for greater democracy. Police say 23-year-old Tong Ying-kit rammed and injured some officers at an illegal protest on Wednesday. A video online showed a motorbike knocking over several officers on a narrow street before the driver falls over and is arrested. Tong, who was hospitalised after the incident, was charged less than 24 hours after the city government said the slogan he was carrying - \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\" - connotes separatism or subversion under the new law. The rallying cry appears on placards, T-shirts, and post-it notes stuck to walls around Hong Kong. China's parliament adopted the security law after sometimes violent protests last year triggered by fears Beijing was stifling freedoms, guaranteed by a \"one country, two systems\" formula agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the law aims at a few \"troublemakers\" and not wider rights that underpin the city's role as a gateway for capital flows in and out of China. But international anxiety is growing after authorities arrested 10 people under the new law within 24 hours of it taking effect. The European Union (EU) has put Hong Kong high on its agenda while the United Nations' rights office expressed alarm over arrests. \"I'm Not Scared\" At another court, dozens gathered in solidarity with a man charged for stabbing a policeman in the arm during Wednesday's disturbances. They held up blank pieces of paper to show fears for free speech. \"I'm not scared. Come what may,\" said a 25-year-old protester who gave his name only as Wilson. On Wednesday's 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, police arrested about 370 people, with 10 cases involving violations of the new law. In a further ominous sign for activists, a Communist Party cadre prominent during a 2011 clampdown on land rights protesters in a south China village is to head a newly-empowered national security office in Hong Kong, official news agency Xinhua said. Zheng Yanxiong, 57, most recently served as secretary general of the Communist Party committee of Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong. Leaked footage during the 2011 dispute showed him berating villagers and calling foreign media \"rotten\". The new legislation gives the security office greater enforcement action and powers to take suspects onto the mainland, as well as granting privileges for agents, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot inspect their vehicles. Some activists have been keeping a low profile or leaving. Demosisto, a pro-democracy group led by Joshua Wong, disbanded hours after the legislation was passed, while prominent group member Nathan Law left the city. \"The protests in Hong Kong have been a window for the world to recognise that China is getting more and more authoritarian,\" Law told Reuters. Hong Kong's publicly-funded public broadcaster RTHK, which has felt the pressure of government scrutiny, appeared to take heed of the law, reproducing the slogan as \"L*******#HongKong\" in a comment on Twitter, to the scorn of some social media users. hong kong / national security laws / China / arrest",

        "title": "Unofficial Hong Kong vote sees new generation take over battle for democracy",
        "body": "A younger, more defiant generation of Hong Kong democrats has secured the most votes in unofficial primary elections in the Chinese-ruled city, setting the stage for a battle with pro-Beijing politicians for control of the city's legislature. The success of young contenders in the primaries organised by the pro-democracy camp on the weekend to pick candidates for a Sept. 6 election for a 70-seat city assembly comes amid widespread resentment of a national security law that Beijing imposed last month. Beijing denounced the vote as illegal and warned it may have violated the new security law, which has raised fears for the freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong's open society and success as a financial hub. Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong won in his district, but he has been disqualified from previous elections and could face similar hurdles this time. Wong warned against any sweeping disqualification of candidates when he held a news conference with 15 other young politicians who won in their districts. \"If the government cracks down on us and disqualifies all the candidates who joined the primaries, it will cause more outrage in the international community and encourage more people to vote for the pro-democratic camp in September,\" Wong said. The 16 - all but one under 30 and dressed in black T-shirts - are part of a so-called localist or resistance camp, which outshone the cohort of traditional democrats, which had secured 12 candidate slots as of Wednesday afternoon. Full results are expected later in the day. The localists - a term for those who do not see themselves as Chinese and focus on saving the former British colony's freedoms - tend to be more assertive than traditional democrats. The localists talk of resistance and saving democracy but they do not all have the same vision for Hong Kong's future. Some dream of independence - anathema for Beijing - but do not speak of it openly, which would see them fall foul of the new security law and face up to life in prison. Their performance in the primaries reflects frustration, especially among younger voters, with Hong Kong's more moderate, traditional pro-democracy politicians. \"Localism has become the mainstream,\" said localist candidate Henry Wong. \"We will resist against the tyranny.\" The new security law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and sees Chinese intelligence agents operating officially in the city for the first time. Critics fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of often violent anti-government protests. Difficult to understand The law has already had a chilling effect on many aspects of life. Earlier on Wednesday, former democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin said he was pulling out as an organiser of the weekend vote amid accusations from Beijing that it was illegal. A spokesman for Beijing's top office in the city, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, said the pro-democracy camp's bid for a legislative majority was an attempt to carry out a \"colour revolution\", referring to uprisings in other parts of the world. In comments that critics said were aimed at instilling fear, the Liaison Office as well as Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the city's leader, Carrie Lam, have all said the primaries could violate the national security law. Benny Tai, another organiser of the pro-democracy polls, was defiant. \"For those who do not recognise democracy, or do not agree with democratic values, it is difficult to understand the meaning of the primary election,\" Tai said. Hong Kong police on Wednesday arrested the vice chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Lo Kin-hei, on charges of unlawful assembly related to a protest in November. The political tension in Hong Kong has alarmed the business community while the new law has raised concern in countries that support the \"one country, two systems\" formula of government meant to safeguard its freedoms. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong's special status under US law to punish China for what he called \"oppressive actions\" against the city. China said it would impose retaliatory sanctions on US individuals and entities after Trump signed a law penalising banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new law. In an interview with state agency Xinhua, Chief Executive Lam said US sanctions won't hurt Hong Kong and in time, concern about the security law would prove unfounded. In another blow to the city's standing, the New York Times said it would shift part of its Hong Kong office to Seoul, as worries grow that the security law will curb media and other freedoms. hong kong / Democracy / primary election",

But you have to remain strong—if you are not strong, your family will also fall apart.” He was later taken to the metropolitan detention center.\n\nNaznin Nahar told the court that the address mentioned in the case documents was Anis Alamgir’s previous address and requested permission to correct it.\n\nAnis Alamgir appeared in court wearing a red jacket and remained in the dock from around 11:00 am to 12:30 pm, during which he was intermittently seen speaking with his lawyers. He was brought to court from the metropolitan detention center at around 11:00 am.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, while Anis Alamgir was already in custody under the Anti-Terrorism Act, the ACC applied to show him arrested in a new case. The application was filed by investigating officer and ACC Assistant Director Akhtaruzzaman. A hearing on the matter was scheduled at the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge’s Court on Wednesday.\n\nAnis Alamgir currently remains in prison in connection with an Anti-Terrorism Act case filed at Uttara West Police Station, defense lawyer Taslima Jahan Popy said.\n\nOn January 15, the ACC filed a case against Anis Alamgir alleging acquisition of assets beyond known sources of income and money laundering. According to the case statement, he possessed immovable assets worth Tk 25 lakh and movable assets worth Tk 3.85 crore, totaling Tk 4.10 crore. Family and other expenditures were calculated at Tk 15.9 lakh, bringing total acquired assets to Tk 4.26 crore.\n\nThe ACC said his total lawful income stood at Tk 99.10 lakh, including past savings of Tk 54.46 lakh, income from talk shows and consultancy services of Tk 19.40 lakh, proceeds from plot sales amounting to Tk 22 lakh, and income from savings certificates and bank interest totaling Tk 3.24 lakh. Assets worth Tk 3.26 crore, or about 77% of the total acquired assets, were identified as acquired beyond known sources of income.\n\nSeparately, on December 14, a case was filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act at Uttara West Police Station by Arian Ahmed, an organizer of the July Revolutionary Alliance. The accused include Anis Alamgir and Meher Afroz Shaon. On December 15, a court granted a five-day remand for Anis Alamgir. He was sent to prison on December 20 after the remand ended and has remained in custody since then.\n\nAccording to the allegations, following the anti-discrimination student movement, former prime pinister Sheikh Hasina left the country, after which her followers allegedly went into hiding and engaged in conspiracies to destabilize the country and damage state infrastructure.\n\nThe accused are alleged to have operated under the patronage of the Awami League and, since August 5 last year, to have spread propaganda through social media and talk shows aimed at reinstating banned organizations.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that on the night of December 14 at around 8:30 pm, the complainant observed from a residence in Sector 11, Road 5, Uttara West, that the accused were using Facebook posts to rehabilitate the Awami League, allegedly inciting members of the banned Chhatra League and Jubo League to engage in criminal activities and conspiracies to destabilize the state and damage national infrastructure.",

        "title": "Nepal mourns its dead after anti-corruption protests",
        "body": "Nepal flew flags at half-mast during a national day of mourning Wednesday for the 73 people killed during youth-led anti-corruption protests that toppled the government. An interim government, which took over after two days of protests last week, declared the day of mourning ‘in honour of those who lost their lives during the protests’, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement. Protests began on September 8, sparked by a short-lived ban on social media, but fuelled by anger at corruption and long-standing economic woes. At least 19 people were killed in a crackdown on the first day. Anger over the deaths escalated, triggering an outpouring of rage nationwide, with government offices, a Hilton Hotel and other buildings set on fire. ‘The changes we are witnessing today would not be possible without the courage and sacrifice of those who gave their lives during the protests,’ Hami Nepal, a key organisation in the protests, posted on social media. Prime minister Sushila Karki, a 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protester demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months. Karki has declared the victims martyrs, promising state honours at their cremations. Shopkeeper Pooja Shrestha, 22, said that the day of mourning would bring people together. ‘Everyone is sad about what happened, the loss of lives — all young people like us,’ she said. ‘Things have improved now, and we hope the new government will bring the changes we need.’ A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447. Streets have been back to bustling business since the protests, but were quieter on Wednesday because it was declared a public holiday. But Lokesh Tamang, 17, sitting in a gift shop in Kathmandu, kept the store open hoping for business after it was closed for days during the unrest. He recalled the ‘intense’ violence and mourned the ‘sad’ deaths of the protesters. ‘We hope that it doesn’t get as bad as it did last week ever again,’ he said. Police spokesman Binod Kharel said Wednesday that the death toll from the protests had risen to 73, including police officers and prisoners as they staged a mass breakout. More than a third of the 13,500 prisoners who escaped from two dozen jails during the protests have been recaptured or surrendered themselves, he added. ‘So far about 5,000 prisoners who had absconded have returned to the prisons, many voluntarily,’ Kharel said.",

        "title": "Iranian protester Erfan released on bail amid conflicting execution claims",
        "body": "Iranian protester Erfan Soltani, who was widely reported last month to have been sentenced to death over anti-government demonstrations, has been released on bail, according to media and rights groups.\n\nSoltani, 26, was detained on 8 January in Fardis, near Tehran, amid nationwide protests that triggered a violent response from security forces. His family was later told by authorities that he was facing imminent execution, though no further details were provided, Norway-based Kurdish rights group Hengaw said, reports UNB.\n\nIran’s judiciary later rejected claims that Soltani had received a death sentence, stating instead that he was charged with security-related offences punishable by imprisonment, reports BBC.\n\nHis lawyer, Amir Mousakhani, told AFP that Soltani was freed on bail on Saturday and had his personal belongings, including his mobile phone, returned. A bail amount of two billion tomans—about $12,600—was posted to secure his release.\n\nHengaw and Iranian outlets, including semi-official news agency Isna, also confirmed the development.\n\nSoltani, a clothing shop owner, drew international attention after reports emerged that he was set to be executed. A relative previously told BBC Persian that a death sentence had allegedly been issued within just two days through an unusually fast legal process.\n\nThe reports prompted international reaction, including warnings from then US President Donald Trump of “very strong action” should executions proceed. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, cautioned that any attack on Iran would ignite a wider regional conflict.\n\nIranian authorities dismissed foreign media reports about Soltani’s execution as false, while Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was no intention to carry out hangings. Hengaw later reported that Soltani’s execution had been postponed, citing family sources.\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations say the death toll from the unrest continues to rise. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency claims more than 6,300 people have been killed since protests began in late December, with thousands more deaths under investigation. Iran Human Rights has warned the total could surpass 25,000.\n\nProtesters have told the BBC that the scale and intensity of the crackdown were unprecedented. On Sunday, Khamenei accused demonstrators of attacking police, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and public institutions, including banks and mosques.",

        "title": "Nepal PM holds first talks since protests with parties, ‘Gen Z’",
        "body": "Nepal’s interim leader has held the first talks between political parties and youth representatives since last month’s deadly anti-corruption protests that toppled the previous government, officials said on Thursday. ‘We have succeeded in creating an environment of cooperation and trust by ending the state of lack of dialogue,’ prime minister Sushila Karki, the former chief justice appointed as interim leader, said in a statement on social media. The unrest on September 8-9 was triggered by a brief ban on social media, although it was fuelled by long-standing frustration over economic hardship and corruption. At least 73 people were killed during the two days of unrest, which left parliament, courts and government buildings in flames. Karki, 73, who will lead the Himalayan nation until elections, held a four-hour meeting with youth representatives on Wednesday, according to her media coordinator Ram Rawal. The challenges ahead to ensure the March 2026 elections pass off smoothly are huge — including deep public distrust in Nepal’s established parties. The meeting, headed by Karki, was attended by all major political parties and several ‘Gen Z’ representatives, Rawal said. Also included were representatives of the party of ousted former prime minister KP Sharma Oli, the Communist Party of Nepal — Unified Marxist Leninist. ‘After the protest, there was a trust gap between them,’ Rawal said. ‘This meeting has helped create an environment of trust for the upcoming elections.’ Karki said in a post on X that ‘the new generation, political parties and the government all have the same goal — to hold fair, secure and timely elections’. She has pledged to restore order and address calls for clean governance in the country of 30 million. Minister for Communication Jagadish Kharel told reporters after the meeting that it was ‘important and fruitful’. The unrest in September hit Nepal’s already fragile economy. The World Bank estimates a ‘staggering’ 82 per cent of the workforce is in informal employment, while GDP per capita stood at just $1,447 in 2024.",

        "body": "Graffiti, often dismissed as mere vandalism, has a rich history that mirrors humanity's enduring desire for expression and identity.\n\nFrom ancient cave paintings to contemporary protest art, graffiti has evolved into a powerful medium for social commentary and change.\n\nThe roots of graffiti can be traced back to prehistoric times, with cave paintings serving as early examples of human expression.\n\nThese depictions of daily life and rituals were humanity's initial attempts at visual communication.\n\nIn ancient Rome and Greece, graffiti took the form of inscriptions on public buildings and monuments, often conveying political messages or personal thoughts, highlighting its longstanding role in societal discourse.\n\nThe graffiti movement as we know it began in the late 1960s and early 1970s in urban centers like Philadelphia and New York City.\n\nArtists such as Cornbread in Philadelphia and TAKI 183 in New York popularized tagging, turning cityscapes into canvases for personal expression.\n\nThis era marked the transformation of graffiti into a competitive and visible art form, with artists striving for recognition in bustling urban environments.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, graffiti became intertwined with the burgeoning hip-hop culture, alongside rap, DJing, and breakdancing.\n\nIt served as a voice for marginalized youth, reflecting their struggles and aspirations.\n\nArtists developed intricate styles, such as \"wildstyle,\" characterized by complex, interlocking letters and vibrant colors, further cementing graffiti's place in urban culture.\n\nAs hip-hop culture gained international prominence, graffiti spread to cities worldwide, each incorporating unique cultural elements.\n\nOver time, it transitioned from back alleys to art galleries, gaining recognition as a legitimate art form.\n\nArtists like Banksy emerged as global icons, using graffiti to challenge societal norms and provoke thought, blurring the lines between street art and mainstream art.\n\nIn August 2024, Bangladesh experienced significant political upheaval, with graffiti playing a key role in the protests. The student-led movement, which began with calls for civil service recruitment reforms, grew into a larger campaign against government policies and corruption.\n\nGraffiti became a powerful tool for protesters to express their dissatisfaction and unite the public.\n\nWalls throughout Dhaka, particularly around Dhaka University, were adorned with colorful murals and slogans advocating for change.\n\nThese artworks not only expressed the youth's frustrations, but also rallied public support for the movement.\n\nGraffiti's widespread use during this time period demonstrated its effectiveness as a means of political expression and mobilization.\n\nToday, graffiti exists in a complex space between vandalism and art.\n\nWhile some view it as defacement, others recognize its artistic value and its role in giving voice to marginalized communities.\n\nThe events in Bangladesh underscore graffiti's potential as a catalyst for social change, demonstrating its power to convey collective sentiments and inspire action.\n\nFrom ancient cave walls to modern urban landscapes, graffiti has served as a medium for human expression, reflecting societal values, challenges, and transformations.\n\nIts evolution into a tool for protest, as seen in the August 2024 movement in Bangladesh, underscores its enduring relevance and impact.\n\nGraffiti stands as a testament to the transformative power of art in shaping societal narratives and driving change.",

        "body": "The Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) has transferred four of its employees to Pangao Inland Container Terminal (ICT) on compulsory grounds for allegedly instigating protests and disrupting urgent operational work at the port. The decision was announced through an office order today (31 January), signed by the chief personnel officer of the CPA. According to the order, the employees were transferred \"in the interest of service and to ensure smooth port operations\" after allegations of involvement in activities that obstructed official duties. Ctg Port paralysed by strike over NCT deal as workers defy warnings The transferred officials are Mohammad Humayun Kabir, audit assistant of the Internal Audit and Inspection Department; Mohammad Ibrahim Hossain, first-grade engine driver of the Marine Department; Mohammad Anowarul Azim, senior accounts assistant of the Accounts and Finance Department; and Mohammad Faridur Rahman, SS Khalasi of the Mechanical Department, who was also attached to Chattogram Port Girls' High School. All four have been attached to the Pay and Accounts Office in Pangao ICT, Dhaka, with immediate effect, the order said. The order also instructed the employees to report to their new posting by 1 February and stated that failure to comply would be treated as a violation of service rules. CPA officials said the transfers were made as part of disciplinary measures to prevent disruption of port operations, which are considered critical for national trade and supply chains. The move comes amid heightened tensions at Chattogram port over ongoing protests related to policy and operational decisions, including the proposed management arrangement of the New Mooring Container Terminal. Port authorities have repeatedly warned employees against participating in demonstrations during office hours, citing court directives and government decisions. Earlier on Tuesday (29 January), the CPA issued a notice ordering disciplinary action against the employees taking part in the protest. In another notice, the CPA issued a warning to take legal action for staging protests in and around port areas and disrupting port operations. However, defying the warnings workers and employees enforced daylong work abstention and staged protest in front of port gates effectively paralysing the port operations today, protesting authorities decision to lease NCT to Dubai based operator DP World in an unsolicited deal.

Moscow's Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, and the city's police force did not immediately respond to comment requests. Activists had planned a protest in central Moscow on July 15 advertised on social media as \"No to an eternal Putin\". A landslide vote this month handed Putin the right to run for two more presidential terms, an outcome the Kremlin described as a triumph. [nL8N2E82EI] Opposition activists say the vote was illegitimate, marred with violations, and that it's time for Putin, who has ruled Russia for over two decades as president or prime minister, to step down. Mass gatherings are currently banned in the capital due to Covid-19 restrictions and protests of more than one person require authorities' advance consent in normal times. Open Russia, a movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said its offices in central Moscow were being searched and that two of its employees, including executive director Andrei Pivovarov, had been detained. Pivovarov earlier on Thursday posted a link on Twitter encouraging people to attend next week's protest. Yulia Galyamina, a Moscow city councillor, said police arrived at her apartment early on Thursday and threatened to tear down the door if they weren't let in. \"It's because of the campaign against the (constitutional) reforms,\" she told Reuters. \"It's because of the planned protest.\" The homes of Tatiana Usmanova and Olga Gorelik, from Open Russia, were also searched on Tuesday, Open Russia said. Sergei Prostakov, editor-in-chief of MBKh Media, a news outlet founded by Khodorkovsky, was also targeted by the searches, his organisation said. Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure, said the searches were designed to scare Kremlin critics. \"This is an attempt to demoralise those who are against Putin and publicly punish those who opposed Putin's amendments,\" Navalny wrote on Twitter.

The government has raised the price bypassing the Jatiya Sangsad, although it always calls for making the parliament effective, the Jatiya Party leaders said. They urged the government to make necessary reforms in the energy sector and check system loss. The Bangladesh Sanjukta Sramik Federation (BSSF) leaders observed that the fuel price hike would multiply the sufferings of the low-income group and create anarchy in the transport sector. In a joint statement, BSSF President Mokhlesur Rahman and general secretary Mokaddem Hossain said the government increased the price without considering the living standard of general people. High price in international market do not justify the fuel price hike as the living standard of general people in Bangladesh do not match with the international standard, they said. Expressing concern over the government decision, Bangladesh Krishak League President Hazi Rashed Mosharraf and general secretary Harun or-Rashid Hawladar said it would bring disaster to the country's agriculture sector. Four left-leaning political parties - Jatiya Gono Front, Biplobi Oikya Front, Gonotantrik Mojdur Party and Gonsonghati Andolon - termed the step anti-people and urged the government to withdraw the decision immediately. They called upon the people to build up resistance against such anti-people steps. The other oranisations which gave statement protesting the decision include The Gontantrik Biplobi Jote, Bangladesh Truck Chalok Sramik Federation, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal also protested the fuel price hike.",

Some demonstrators were also seen hurling shoes at an effigy bearing the photograph of Law Adviser Asif Nazrul during the rally. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Inqilab Mancha and secretary of the Liberation War and Democratic Movement of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, called on people to join the protest. “Everyone come to Shahbagh,” she wrote in a Facebook post following Hadi’s funeral.

        "body": "Iranian protester Erfan Soltani, who was widely reported last month to have been sentenced to death over anti-government demonstrations, has been released on bail, according to media and rights groups.\n\nSoltani, 26, was detained on 8 January in Fardis, near Tehran, amid nationwide protests that triggered a violent response from security forces. His family was later told by authorities that he was facing imminent execution, though no further details were provided, Norway-based Kurdish rights group Hengaw said, reports UNB.\n\nIran’s judiciary later rejected claims that Soltani had received a death sentence, stating instead that he was charged with security-related offences punishable by imprisonment, reports BBC.\n\nHis lawyer, Amir Mousakhani, told AFP that Soltani was freed on bail on Saturday and had his personal belongings, including his mobile phone, returned. A bail amount of two billion tomans—about $12,600—was posted to secure his release.\n\nHengaw and Iranian outlets, including semi-official news agency Isna, also confirmed the development.\n\nSoltani, a clothing shop owner, drew international attention after reports emerged that he was set to be executed. A relative previously told BBC Persian that a death sentence had allegedly been issued within just two days through an unusually fast legal process.\n\nThe reports prompted international reaction, including warnings from then US President Donald Trump of “very strong action” should executions proceed. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, cautioned that any attack on Iran would ignite a wider regional conflict.\n\nIranian authorities dismissed foreign media reports about Soltani’s execution as false, while Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was no intention to carry out hangings. Hengaw later reported that Soltani’s execution had been postponed, citing family sources.\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations say the death toll from the unrest continues to rise. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency claims more than 6,300 people have been killed since protests began in late December, with thousands more deaths under investigation. Iran Human Rights has warned the total could surpass 25,000.\n\nProtesters have told the BBC that the scale and intensity of the crackdown were unprecedented. On Sunday, Khamenei accused demonstrators of attacking police, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and public institutions, including banks and mosques.",

        "body": "City dwellers suffered for at least three and a half hours until 6:00pm on Sunday as different groups staged separate street protests and a road blockade in front of the Jatiya Press Club and its adjoining areas in the capital, mainly to press home their job-related demands, leading to huge traffic congestion in the area. Several groups, including the Independent Ebtedayee Madrasah Teachers’ Union, the teachers of schools for students with disabilities, and the United Non-MPO Unity Council began separate sit-in demonstrations near the press club in the morning. Traffic congestion began in the area at about 2:30pm when several thousand teachers, under the platform of the Independent Ebtedayee Madrassah Teachers’ Union, brought out a march towards the chief adviser’s residence Jamuna, and were intercepted by the police at Kadam Foara, after marching a few yards. Sunday was the 21st day of the continuous sit-in programme of the ebtedayee madrassah teachers in the National Press Club area. After facing the police barricade, the protesting madrassah teachers sat down, which ultimately blocked one side of the road. They have been demanding the immediate implementation of the government’s January 28 announcement that all approved independent ebtedayee madrasahs would be nationalised. Due to the blockade, traffic movement became standstill on both ends of the blockade point. As time passed, traffic congestion spread to the nearby areas, which affected several other areas, including Matshyabhaba, Shahbagh, Banglamotor, Paltan, Bijoy Sarani, Naya Paltan, Mouchak, Gulistan, and some other parts of Old Dhaka. The platform’s chairman, Mokhlesur Rahman, said that they withdrew their blockade from the road at about 6:00pm after a fruitful meeting with the education ministry officials. He, however, said that they would continue their movement until their demand was met. Meanwhile, several thousand teachers under the United Non-MPO Unity Council also staged a sit-in in front of the Press Club, demanding that the government bring all approved non-MPO educational institutions under MPO facilities. They also brought out a procession in the afternoon. The procession paraded nearby roads. Teachers and staff members of schools for disabled students, on the other hand, held a march towards the Bangladesh Secretariat in the afternoon, demanding recognition of their institutions and declaration of monthly pay order for them. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s deputy commissioner for media and public relations, Talebur Rahman, in a press release, said that simultaneous street protests by several groups disrupted traffic at different places in the capital. ‘These (the street protests) have disrupted traffic on several important roads, causing widespread public suffering and severe traffic congestion in some parts of the capital,’ he said. The police said that traffic movement became normal after 6:00pm.",

        "body": "কোভিডের সময় থেকেই বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতির গতি কমতে শুরু করে। এরপর রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধের জেরে তেলের দাম বেড়ে যাওয়া এবং ডলার–সংকটের কারণে অর্থনীতি আরেক দফা ধাক্কা খায়। এই বাস্তবতায় ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনের পর অর্থনীতি যখন স্থিতিশীল হতে শুরু করে, তখন গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের মধ্য দিয়ে সরকারের পতন হলো। দেশে ড. মুহাম্মদ ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকার গঠিত হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতিতে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে এখন কী করা দরকার, সে বিষয়ে আন্তর্জাতিক গণমাধ্যমগুলো বিভিন্ন ধরনের ব্যাখ্যা-বিশ্লেষণ দিচ্ছে। সেই সঙ্গে শেখ হাসিনার পতনের কারণসমূহও তুলে ধরছে গণমাধ্যমগুলো। তারা বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার মূল কারণ হিসেবে তরুণদের বেকারত্বকেই চিহ্নিত করেছে। এ ছাড়া কাঠামোগত বিভিন্ন চ্যালেঞ্জের কথাও জানিয়েছে তারা। নতুন সরকারের কী করণীয়, সে বিষয়েও বিদেশি গণমাধ্যমগুলো মোটামুটি একই সুরে কথা বলেছে। জার্মান সংবাদমাধ্যম ডয়চে ভেলের সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশে তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থানের মূল কারণ হলো বেকারত্ব। প্রতিবছর বিপুলসংখ্যক তরুণ কর্মবাজারে প্রবেশ করছেন; যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "প্রতিবেশী ইরানের সঙ্গে ভূরাজনৈতিক উত্তেজনা পাকিস্তানের খুঁড়িয়ে চলা অর্থনীতিকে রীতিমতো ঝাঁকি দিয়েছে। দেশটির শেয়ারবাজার এর ফলে পড়ে গেছে, আর বড় ধাক্কা খেয়েছে ডলার বন্ড। রয়টার্স জানিয়েছে, বালুচ বিদ্রোহীদের লক্ষ্য করে আজ বৃহস্পতিবার ইরানের ভেতরে হামলা চালিয়েছে পাকিস্তান। দুই দিন আগে তেহরান জানিয়েছিল যে আরেকটি গোষ্ঠীর ঘাঁটি লক্ষ্য করে তারা পাকিস্তানের ভেতরে হামলা চালিয়েছে। ইরানের ওই হামলার পর পাকিস্তান তাদের হামলার কথা জানাল। তেহরানের সঙ্গে ইসলামাবাদের এই মুখোমুখি হওয়ার ঘটনা এমন সময় ঘটেছে, যখন পাকিস্তানের অর্থনীতি মারাত্মক সংকটের ভেতর দিয়ে যাচ্ছে। দেশটির অর্থনীতির আকার ৩৫ হাজার কোটি ডলার। কিন্তু এই অর্থনীতির বড় সমস্যা উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি এবং ক্রমেই বেড়ে চলা রাজস্ব ও চলতি হিসাবের বিশাল ঘাটতি। আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল (আইএমএফ) পাকিস্তানকে ৩০০ ডলার ঋণ দিয়েছে। কিন্তু এর জন্য মানতে হচ্ছে কঠিন সব শর্ত। এই ঋণ পাকিস্তানকে গত গ্রীষ্মে খেলাপি হওয়া থেকে রক্ষা করেছে। ইরানের অভ্যন্তরে হামলা চালানো হয়েছে, পাকিস্তানের পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয় বৃহস্পতিবার এমন কথা জানানোর পর দেশটির ছাড়া আন্তর্জাতিক বন্ডের মূল্যপতন ঘটেছে। যেসব বন্ডের দাম সবচেয়ে বেশি কমেছে, তার মধ্যে রয়েছে ২০২৬ বন্ড হিসেবে পরিচিত একটি বন্ড। দিনের শুরুতে পাকিস্তানের মূল শেয়ার সূচক ১ দশমিক ৬ শতাংশ পড়ে যায়। পরের দিকে সূচক অবশ্য খানিকটা বাড়ে। ইরানের সঙ্গে পাকিস্তানের খুব বড় ধরনের অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক নেই। তবে সেই দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কও পাকিস্তানের জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। পাকিস্তানের সর্ব পশ্চিমের প্রদেশ হলো বালুচিস্তান। সেখানে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পণ্য পাঠাতে পাকিস্তানকে রীতিমতো সংগ্রাম করতে হয়, বিশেষ করে জ্বালানি ও বিদ্যুৎ। পাকিস্তানের অনেক এলাকায় বিদ্যুৎ আসে ইরান থেকে। আর অনানুষ্ঠানিকভাবে দুই দেশের মধ্যে অনেক পণ্যের লেনদেন হয়। এসব পণ্যের মধ্যে রয়েছে তরল পেট্রোলিয়াম গ্যাস (এলপিজি) ও ইরানের ডিজেল। গত বছর জুন মাসে পাকিস্তান একটি বিশেষ আদেশের মাধ্যমে ইরানের সঙ্গে সীমান্ত বাণিজ্য চালু করে। পেট্রোলিয়াম ও প্রাকৃতিক গ্যাসসহ বেশ কয়েকটি পণ্য সীমান্ত বাণিজ্যে লেনদেন হয়। একই ধরনের বাণিজ্যব্যবস্থা আফগানিস্তান ও রাশিয়ার সঙ্গেও চালু করেছে পাকিস্তান। ইসলামাবাদ পলিসি রিসার্চ ইনস্টিটিউটের অর্থনৈতিক নিরাপত্তা বিভাগের চেয়ার আনীল সালমান বলেন, ‘দুই দেশের মধ্যে যে ২০০ কোটি ডলারের বাণিজ্য হয়, তা দেশ দুটোর জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। বিশেষ করে বালুচিস্তানের মতো এলাকার জন্য। এই এলাকার মানুষ ইরানের সঙ্গে বাণিজ্যের ওপর অনেকটাই নির্ভরশীল। বিশেষ করে কৃষিপণ্য ও পেট্রোকেমিক্যালের জন্য।’ আনীল সালমান আরও বলেন, বাণিজ্যে যেকোনো ধরনের বাধা পড়লে তার অর্থনৈতিক প্রতিক্রিয়া থাকবে। পাকিস্তানে পণ্যের ঘাটতি হবে। আর দুই দেশের মধ্যকার ২০০ কোটি ডলারের বাণিজ্যও কমে যাবে। পাকিস্তান ও ইরানের মধ্যে একটি গ্যাস পাইপলাইন নির্মাণ করা হচ্ছে। এটি পরিচিত পিস পাইপলাইন বা শান্তির পাইপলাইন হিসেবে। আনীল সালমান মনে করেন, দুই দেশের মধ্যে সংঘাত দীর্ঘমেয়াদি এই প্রকল্পে বড় রকমের প্রভাব রাখবে। এই পাইপলাইনের মাধ্যমে ইরান থেকে পাকিস্তানে গ্যাস পরিবহন করার কথা। পাইপলাইনটি ব্যবহার করে ভারতে গ্যাস যাবে, এমন সম্ভাবনাও রয়েছে। এর বাস্তবায়ন এরই মধ্যে পিছিয়ে গেছে। সংঘাতের কারণে এই প্রকল্প আরও পিছিয়ে যেতে পারে। একই সঙ্গে এর জন্য বিনিয়োগ পাওয়া আরও কঠিন হতে পারে। দেশ দুটি ২০২৩ সালের আগস্টে পাঁচ বছর মেয়াদি একটি বাণিজ্য চুক্তি করে। তাদের লক্ষ্য দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্যের পরিমাণ ৫০০ কোটি ডলারে উন্নীত করা। টেলিমারের ইকুইটি গবেষণা বিভাগের প্রধান হাসনাইন মালিক বলেন, বাইরে থেকে দেখে মনে হচ্ছে এই সংঘাত বাড়বে না। কিন্তু এটাও মনে রাখতে হবে সর্বশেষ এ ঘটনা এমন সময় ঘটেছে, যখন পাকিস্তান যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক উন্নয়নের জন্য চেষ্টা চালিয়ে যাচ্ছে।",

        "body": "গত রাজনৈতিক সরকারের আমলে দেশের অর্থনৈতিক সাফল্যের যে গল্প শুনেছি আমরা, সেটি দাঁড়িয়ে ছিল এক নড়বড়ে ভিত্তির ওপর। প্রবৃদ্ধির চটকদার শিরোনামের আড়ালে চাপা পড়েছিল অর্থনীতির গভীর কাঠামোগত দুর্বলতা। বছরের পর বছর ধরে চলা অসামঞ্জস্যতা একদিকে বাড়িয়েছে ঋণের বোঝা, অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকিং খাতের অনিয়মের কারণে খেলাপি ঋণের হার পৌঁছেছে সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বের কয়টা দেশে ব্যাংক খাতের খেলাপি ঋণ ৩৫ শতাংশের বেশি, সেটি খুঁজে পাওয়া দুষ্কর। শুধু কি খেলাপি ঋণ? আস্থার সংকটে ২০২২ থেকে ২০২৪ সালের মাঝামাঝি সময়ের মধ্যে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ কমেছে প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ। পুঁজি পাচার হয়েছে ব্যাপকভাবে। আর মূল্যস্ফীতি উঠেছিল এক যুগের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায়। সুদের হারের কৃত্রিম সীমা আরোপ এবং বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের টাকা ছাপানোর আগ্রাসী নীতি মূল্যস্ফীতির আগুনকে আরও উসকে দিয়েছিল। তথ্যের অস্বচ্ছতা পরিস্থিতির প্রকৃত ভয়াবহতাকে আড়াল করে রেখেছিল, যা শেষ পর্যন্ত রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতার পথ প্রশস্ত করে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থান এবং গণমানুষের দাবির মুখে গঠিত অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এরই মধ্যে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিকে স্থিতিশীল করার ক্ষেত্রে দৃশ্যমান অগ্রগতি অর্জন করেছে। আমদানিতে কঠোরতা এবং বাজারভিত্তিক বিনিময় হার চালুর ফলে প্রবাসী আয়ে শক্তিশালী প্রবৃদ্ধি দেখা গেছে, যার সুবাদে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ ৩০ শতাংশেরও বেশি পুনরুদ্ধার হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি কিছুটা সহনীয় পর্যায়ে এসেছে এবং সম্পদের গুণগত মান পর্যালোচনা ও কঠোর তদারকির মাধ্যমে খেলাপি ঋণ সংকট মোকাবিলায় প্রাথমিক পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। তবুও, এই ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর প্রক্রিয়াটি এখনো নাজুক। ব্যবসায়ীদের বিনিয়োগের আস্থায় চিড়, শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ কমে যাওয়া এবং দীর্ঘস্থায়ী রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে গত বছর শেষে মোট দেশজ উৎপাদনের (জিডিপি) প্রবৃদ্ধি চার শতাংশের নিচে নামার শঙ্কা রয়েছে। এমন এক বাস্তবতায় রাজনৈতিক স্বচ্ছতা অর্থনীতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ধারণে বড় নির্ণায়ক হিসেবে দেখা দিয়েছে। নির্বাচিত সরকারের কাছে ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তরের প্রক্রিয়া নিয়ে সৃষ্ট অনিশ্চয়তা বিনিয়োগকারীদের মনোজগতে চাপ সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দীর্ঘ প্রবাস জীবনের পর তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফিরে আসায় সেই অনিশ্চয়তা কিছুটা কাটতে শুরু করে। তাঁকে ঘিরে ব্যবসায়ীসহ দেশবাসীর প্রত্যাশাও বেড়েছে। এটি মধ্য মেয়াদে অর্থনীতির জন্য একটি গঠনমূলক বা ইতিবাচকই বলা যায়। এই অবস্থায় আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল বা আইএমএফের পূর্বাভাসে বলা হয়েছে, চলতি বছর জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি প্রায় ৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত হতে পারে। এদিকে, সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিতে কিছুটা স্থিতিশীলতা এলেও দেশের পুঁজিবাজার বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাঙ্ক্ষিত প্রত্যাশা পূরণে ব্যর্থ হচ্ছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) প্রধান সূচক ডিএসইএক্স বহু বছরের মধ্যে সর্বনিম্ন পর্যায়ে ঘোরাফেরা করছে। ভালো ভালো অনেক কোম্পানির শেয়ারের দাম কমে তলানিতে ঠেকেছে। আঞ্চলিক শেয়ারবাজারগুলোর উত্থান সত্ত্বেও আমাদের শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগকারীদের অংশগ্রহণ আশঙ্কাজনকভাবে কমে গেছে। এই পশ্চাৎপদতা মূলত কাঠামোগত। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ভালো মানের কোনো কোম্পানি বাজারে আসেনি। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার অদক্ষতা, ব্যাংক ঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরশীলতা, ফিক্সড ইনকাম বা সঞ্চয়পত্রের উচ্চ সুদ এবং প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারীর অভাব বাজারে তারল্য সংকট ও আস্থার ঘাটতিকে স্থায়ী রূপ দিয়েছে। বাংলাদেশ এখন একটি ঐতিহাসিক সন্ধিক্ষণে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির স্থিতিশীলতা, রিজার্ভের উন্নতি এবং রাজনৈতিক উত্তরণ পুঁজিবাজারকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করার একটি সংকীর্ণ কিন্তু অর্থবহ সুযোগ তৈরি করেছে। এই সুযোগ কাজে লাগিয়ে শেয়ারবাজারের টেকসই পুনরুদ্ধার নিশ্চিত করতে প্রয়োজন একটি সমন্বিত সংস্কার কর্মসূচি। তার জন্য কাঠামোগত বাধাগুলো দূর করার মাধ্যমে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বাজার উন্নয়নের পথ সুগম করতে হবে। ভালো কোম্পানি যাতে শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত হতে আগ্রহী হয় সে জন্য কোম্পানিগুলোকে রাজস্ব নীতির মাধ্যমে উৎসাহিত করা- এখন সময়ের দাবি। তালিকাভুক্ত এবং অ-তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানির করপোরেট করের ব্যবধান ১০ থেকে ১৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত করতে হবে। পাশাপাশি, করমুক্ত লভ্যাংশ বা ডিভিডেন্ড আয় জনগণকে শেয়ারবাজারমুখী করবে। বাজারে বিনিয়োগকারীর অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে, বাজারের গভীরতাও তত বাড়বে। একই সঙ্গে পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার সংস্কারও সমানভাবে জরুরি। একটি সুশৃঙ্খল বাজারের জন্য ডিজিটাল আর্থিক রিপোর্টিং, ভালো কোম্পানি বাজারে আনার পথ সহজ করার মাধ্যমে বাজারে ভালো শেয়ারের সরবরাহ বাড়াতে হবে। এতে ব্যাংকঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরতা কমবে। অন্যদিকে শক্তিশালী করপোরেট সুশাসন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। এ জন্য স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জগুলোকেও শক্তিশালী করতে হবে। যাতে স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের পক্ষ থেকে বাজারে তদারকি জোরদার করা যায়। সেটি হলে বিনিয়োগকারীদের সুরক্ষা বাড়বে। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির ক্ষেত্রে কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হচ্ছে সংস্কার। পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা বিএসইসির কার্যকারিতা এবং জবাবদিহি বাড়ানোর পাশাপাশি রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত বিনিয়োগ সংস্থা ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করপোরেশন অব বাংলাদেশকে (আইসিবি) পুনরুজ্জীবিত করতে হবে। তাতে নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার প্রতি বিনিয়োগকারীদের বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা বাড়বে। এ ছাড়া, আন্তসংস্থা সমন্বয় এবং উন্নত আর্থিক সাক্ষরতা অত্যন্ত জরুরি। সেই সঙ্গে বেসরকারি খাতের কোম্পানির তালিকাভুক্তিতে প্রণোদনা এবং সঞ্চয়পত্রের সুদহারের যৌক্তিকীকরণের মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক ও পুঁজিবাজারের মধ্যে ভারসাম্য আনতে হবে, তাতে বাজারে তারল্য সরবরাহ বাড়বে। পুঁজিবাজারের টেকসই প্রবৃদ্ধি নির্ভর করে একটি শক্তিশালী প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারী ভিত্তি তৈরির ওপর। তার জন্য জরুরি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড শিল্পের বিকাশ। পেশাদার তহবিল ব্যবস্থাপকদের মাধ্যমে পরিচালিত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে বাজারে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বিনিয়োগের সংস্কৃতিও তৈরি হবে। তাতে বাজারে অস্থিরতা কমবে; কিন্তু দুঃখজনকভাবে দেশের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড খাতটি এখনো প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে রয়েছে। ভারতের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার দেশটির জিডিপির প্রায় ২০ শতাংশ। সেখানে বাংলাদেশে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার জিডিপির মাত্র শূন্য দশমিক ২ শতাংশ। পুঁজিবাজারকে যদি মৌলিক ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করাতে হয়, তবে এই অনুপাত উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বাড়াতে হবে। এ জন্য প্রয়োজন লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিসহায়তা। মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে বিনিয়োগের কর রেয়াত সুবিধা ১৫ শতাংশ থেকে বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা, ৫ লাখ টাকা পর্যন্ত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের লভ্যাংশ আয়কে করমুক্ত রাখা এবং আইপিওতে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের কোটা বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা হলে তাতে খাতটি বড় হবে। এ ছাড়া বেমেয়াদি ও মেয়াদি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে ব্যাংকের বিনিয়োগের ওপর বিদ্যমান ১৫ শতাংশের সীমা তুলে নেওয়া প্রয়োজন। কারণ, এই সীমাবদ্ধতা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক পুঁজি বিনিয়োগকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করছে। যদি এই সংস্কারগুলো ধারাবাহিকভাবে বাস্তবায়ন করা যায়, তবে দেশের পুঁজিবাজারও দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধির একটি শক্তিশালী ভিতে পরিণত হবে। লেখক পরিচিতি: ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক ও প্রধান নির্বাহী, ভ্যানগার্ড অ্যাসেট ম্যানেজমেন্ট",

যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "শিল্পখাতের সঙ্গে সংশ্লিষ্ট সবার অভিমত বিবেচনায় নিয়ে নতুন শিল্পনীতি চূড়ান্ত করা হবে বলে জানিয়েছেন শিল্পমন্ত্রী আমির হোসেন আমু। তিনি বলেন, এ নীতি দেশে শিল্পায়নের উপযোগী পরিবেশ তৈরি করবে। সরকার সংযোজন শিল্পের পরিবর্তে শিল্পপণ্য উৎপাদনের ওপর গুরুত্ব দিচ্ছে। রবিবার রাজধানীর মেট্রোপলিটন চেম্বার অব কমার্স মিলনায়তনে ‘বাংলাদেশের শিল্পনীতি’ শীর্ষক সংলাপে প্রধান অতিথির বক্তব্যে তিনি এসব কথা বলেন। শিল্পমন্ত্রী বলেন, দেশব্যাপী টেকসই শিল্পখাতের বিকাশে সরকারের নীতি সহায়তা অব্যাহত রয়েছে। হালকা প্রকৌশল, কেমিক্যাল এবং ওষুধ শিল্পের কাঁচামাল তৈরির জন্য নতুন শিল্পপার্ক গড়ে তোলা হচ্ছে। রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত চিনিশিল্প লাভজনক করতে ইতোমধ্যে চিনিকলগুলোতে পণ্য বৈচিত্রকরণের উদ্যোগ নেওয়া হয়েছে। সরকারি-বেসরকারি অংশীদারিত্বে বন্ধ কল-কারখানা চালুর বিষয়ে সরকারের কোনও আপত্তি নেই। আইসিসির প্রেসিডেন্ট মাহাবুবুর রহমানের সঞ্চালনায় সংলাপে বিশেষ অতিথি ছিলেন শিল্পসচিব মোশাররফ হোসেন ভূঁইয়া। এতে খসড়া শিল্পনীতি-২০১৫ এর বিভিন্ন দিক তুলে ধরেন মন্ত্রণালয়ের সিনিয়র সহকারী সচিব মো. সলিম উল্লাহ। এ সময় দেশে সুসংহত শিল্পখাত গড়ে তোলার লক্ষ্যে শিল্প মন্ত্রণালয়ে একটি তথ্য ও গবেষণা সেল স্থাপনের তাগিদ দিয়েছেন শিল্প উদ্যোক্তারা। তারা নতুন শিল্পনীতিতে এ ধরনের সেল গঠনের বিষয়টিকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করারও পরামর্শ দেন। এর আওতায় খাতভিত্তিক গবেষণা চালিয়ে নতুন শিল্প উদ্যোক্তাদের শিল্প স্থাপনের জন্য প্রয়োজনীয় তথ্য ও নির্দেশনা দিতে হবে বলে জানান তারা। অনুষ্ঠানে সাবেক তত্ত্বাবধায়ক সরকারের শিল্পবিষয়ক বিশেষ সহকারী মাহাবুব জামিল, এফবিসিসিআই’র সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট একে আজাদ ও মীর নাসির হোসেন, ডিসিসিআই’র সাবেক প্রেসিডেন্ট আসিফ ইব্রাহীম ও মতিউর রহমান, আমেরিকান চেম্বারের সাবেক সভাপতি আফতাব-উল-ইসলাম, আন্তর্জাতিক শিল্পনীতি বিশেষজ্ঞ ড. তৌফিক আলী, বাংলাদেশ সংবাদপত্র মালিক সমিতির সভাপতি মতিউর রহমানসহ বিশিষ্ট শিল্প উদ্যোক্তা ও ট্রেড বডির নেতারা আলোচনায় অংশ নেন। অনুষ্ঠানে বক্তারা বলেন, শিল্প সংক্রান্ত প্রয়োজনীয় পরিসংখ্যান ও গবেষণা না থাকায় দেশে একই রকম শিল্প স্থাপনের হিড়িক পড়ে যায়। ফলে একটি শিল্পখাতে অপরিকল্পিতভাবে অনেক শিল্প গড়ে ওঠে এবং ক্রমান্বয়ে এগুলো রুগ্ন শিল্পে পরিণত হয়। এ ধরনের অনাকাঙ্ক্ষিত পরিস্থিতি এড়াতে তারা দ্রুত একটি ‘তথ্য ও গবেষণা সেল’ স্থাপনের ওপর গুরুত্ব দেন। একইসঙ্গে তারা দেশব্যাপী গুণগত শিল্পায়নের ধারা জোরদারের লক্ষ্যে নতুন শিল্পনীতিতে ইপিজেড ও ইপিজেডের বাইরে অবস্থিত শিল্প কারখানার জন্য একই রকম শুল্ক সুবিধা প্রদানের বিষয়টি নিশ্চিত করার দাবি জানান। শিল্প উদ্যোক্তারা বলেন, নতুন শিল্পনীতিকে বাস্তবায়ন করতে হলে, শিল্পনীতিতেই এর সঙ্গে সংশ্লিষ্ট মন্ত্রণালয়গুলোর দায়িত্ব সুনির্দিষ্ট করে দিতে হবে। শিল্পনীতির বাস্তবায়নে আন্তঃমন্ত্রণালয় সমন্বয় জোরদার করতে হবে। তারা শিল্পখাতের বিকাশে নতুন শিল্পনীতিতে সিঙ্গেল ডিজিট সুদে শিল্পঋণ প্রাপ্তি, উদ্যোক্তাদের শিল্প স্থাপনে ওয়ান স্টপ সেবা প্রদান, সম্পূর্ণ তৈরি শিল্পপণ্য আমদানিতে অধিক শুল্কারোপ, বিশেষায়িত শিল্পাঞ্চলগুলোতে নিরববিছন্ন গ্যাস ও বিদ্যুৎ সরবরাহ, পরিবেশ সুরক্ষাসহ অন্যান্য বিষয়ে নিশ্চিত করার তাগিদ দেন। এক্ষেত্রে তারা শিল্প মন্ত্রণালয়কে নেতৃস্থানীয় ভূমিকা পালনের পরামর্শ দেন।",

        "body": "কোভিডের সময় থেকেই বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতির গতি কমতে শুরু করে। এরপর রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধের জেরে তেলের দাম বেড়ে যাওয়া এবং ডলার–সংকটের কারণে অর্থনীতি আরেক দফা ধাক্কা খায়। এই বাস্তবতায় ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনের পর অর্থনীতি যখন স্থিতিশীল হতে শুরু করে, তখন গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের মধ্য দিয়ে সরকারের পতন হলো। দেশে ড. মুহাম্মদ ইউনূসের নেতৃত্বে অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকার গঠিত হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতিতে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে এখন কী করা দরকার, সে বিষয়ে আন্তর্জাতিক গণমাধ্যমগুলো বিভিন্ন ধরনের ব্যাখ্যা-বিশ্লেষণ দিচ্ছে। সেই সঙ্গে শেখ হাসিনার পতনের কারণসমূহও তুলে ধরছে গণমাধ্যমগুলো। তারা বাংলাদেশের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার মূল কারণ হিসেবে তরুণদের বেকারত্বকেই চিহ্নিত করেছে। এ ছাড়া কাঠামোগত বিভিন্ন চ্যালেঞ্জের কথাও জানিয়েছে তারা। নতুন সরকারের কী করণীয়, সে বিষয়েও বিদেশি গণমাধ্যমগুলো মোটামুটি একই সুরে কথা বলেছে। জার্মান সংবাদমাধ্যম ডয়চে ভেলের সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশে তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থানের মূল কারণ হলো বেকারত্ব। প্রতিবছর বিপুলসংখ্যক তরুণ কর্মবাজারে প্রবেশ করছেন; যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "গত রাজনৈতিক সরকারের আমলে দেশের অর্থনৈতিক সাফল্যের যে গল্প শুনেছি আমরা, সেটি দাঁড়িয়ে ছিল এক নড়বড়ে ভিত্তির ওপর। প্রবৃদ্ধির চটকদার শিরোনামের আড়ালে চাপা পড়েছিল অর্থনীতির গভীর কাঠামোগত দুর্বলতা। বছরের পর বছর ধরে চলা অসামঞ্জস্যতা একদিকে বাড়িয়েছে ঋণের বোঝা, অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকিং খাতের অনিয়মের কারণে খেলাপি ঋণের হার পৌঁছেছে সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বের কয়টা দেশে ব্যাংক খাতের খেলাপি ঋণ ৩৫ শতাংশের বেশি, সেটি খুঁজে পাওয়া দুষ্কর। শুধু কি খেলাপি ঋণ? আস্থার সংকটে ২০২২ থেকে ২০২৪ সালের মাঝামাঝি সময়ের মধ্যে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ কমেছে প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ। পুঁজি পাচার হয়েছে ব্যাপকভাবে। আর মূল্যস্ফীতি উঠেছিল এক যুগের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায়। সুদের হারের কৃত্রিম সীমা আরোপ এবং বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের টাকা ছাপানোর আগ্রাসী নীতি মূল্যস্ফীতির আগুনকে আরও উসকে দিয়েছিল। তথ্যের অস্বচ্ছতা পরিস্থিতির প্রকৃত ভয়াবহতাকে আড়াল করে রেখেছিল, যা শেষ পর্যন্ত রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতার পথ প্রশস্ত করে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থান এবং গণমানুষের দাবির মুখে গঠিত অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এরই মধ্যে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিকে স্থিতিশীল করার ক্ষেত্রে দৃশ্যমান অগ্রগতি অর্জন করেছে। আমদানিতে কঠোরতা এবং বাজারভিত্তিক বিনিময় হার চালুর ফলে প্রবাসী আয়ে শক্তিশালী প্রবৃদ্ধি দেখা গেছে, যার সুবাদে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ ৩০ শতাংশেরও বেশি পুনরুদ্ধার হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি কিছুটা সহনীয় পর্যায়ে এসেছে এবং সম্পদের গুণগত মান পর্যালোচনা ও কঠোর তদারকির মাধ্যমে খেলাপি ঋণ সংকট মোকাবিলায় প্রাথমিক পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। তবুও, এই ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর প্রক্রিয়াটি এখনো নাজুক। ব্যবসায়ীদের বিনিয়োগের আস্থায় চিড়, শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ কমে যাওয়া এবং দীর্ঘস্থায়ী রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে গত বছর শেষে মোট দেশজ উৎপাদনের (জিডিপি) প্রবৃদ্ধি চার শতাংশের নিচে নামার শঙ্কা রয়েছে। এমন এক বাস্তবতায় রাজনৈতিক স্বচ্ছতা অর্থনীতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ধারণে বড় নির্ণায়ক হিসেবে দেখা দিয়েছে। নির্বাচিত সরকারের কাছে ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তরের প্রক্রিয়া নিয়ে সৃষ্ট অনিশ্চয়তা বিনিয়োগকারীদের মনোজগতে চাপ সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দীর্ঘ প্রবাস জীবনের পর তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফিরে আসায় সেই অনিশ্চয়তা কিছুটা কাটতে শুরু করে। তাঁকে ঘিরে ব্যবসায়ীসহ দেশবাসীর প্রত্যাশাও বেড়েছে। এটি মধ্য মেয়াদে অর্থনীতির জন্য একটি গঠনমূলক বা ইতিবাচকই বলা যায়। এই অবস্থায় আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল বা আইএমএফের পূর্বাভাসে বলা হয়েছে, চলতি বছর জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি প্রায় ৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত হতে পারে। এদিকে, সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিতে কিছুটা স্থিতিশীলতা এলেও দেশের পুঁজিবাজার বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাঙ্ক্ষিত প্রত্যাশা পূরণে ব্যর্থ হচ্ছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) প্রধান সূচক ডিএসইএক্স বহু বছরের মধ্যে সর্বনিম্ন পর্যায়ে ঘোরাফেরা করছে। ভালো ভালো অনেক কোম্পানির শেয়ারের দাম কমে তলানিতে ঠেকেছে। আঞ্চলিক শেয়ারবাজারগুলোর উত্থান সত্ত্বেও আমাদের শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগকারীদের অংশগ্রহণ আশঙ্কাজনকভাবে কমে গেছে। এই পশ্চাৎপদতা মূলত কাঠামোগত। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ভালো মানের কোনো কোম্পানি বাজারে আসেনি। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার অদক্ষতা, ব্যাংক ঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরশীলতা, ফিক্সড ইনকাম বা সঞ্চয়পত্রের উচ্চ সুদ এবং প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারীর অভাব বাজারে তারল্য সংকট ও আস্থার ঘাটতিকে স্থায়ী রূপ দিয়েছে। বাংলাদেশ এখন একটি ঐতিহাসিক সন্ধিক্ষণে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির স্থিতিশীলতা, রিজার্ভের উন্নতি এবং রাজনৈতিক উত্তরণ পুঁজিবাজারকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করার একটি সংকীর্ণ কিন্তু অর্থবহ সুযোগ তৈরি করেছে। এই সুযোগ কাজে লাগিয়ে শেয়ারবাজারের টেকসই পুনরুদ্ধার নিশ্চিত করতে প্রয়োজন একটি সমন্বিত সংস্কার কর্মসূচি। তার জন্য কাঠামোগত বাধাগুলো দূর করার মাধ্যমে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বাজার উন্নয়নের পথ সুগম করতে হবে। ভালো কোম্পানি যাতে শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত হতে আগ্রহী হয় সে জন্য কোম্পানিগুলোকে রাজস্ব নীতির মাধ্যমে উৎসাহিত করা- এখন সময়ের দাবি। তালিকাভুক্ত এবং অ-তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানির করপোরেট করের ব্যবধান ১০ থেকে ১৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত করতে হবে। পাশাপাশি, করমুক্ত লভ্যাংশ বা ডিভিডেন্ড আয় জনগণকে শেয়ারবাজারমুখী করবে। বাজারে বিনিয়োগকারীর অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে, বাজারের গভীরতাও তত বাড়বে। একই সঙ্গে পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার সংস্কারও সমানভাবে জরুরি। একটি সুশৃঙ্খল বাজারের জন্য ডিজিটাল আর্থিক রিপোর্টিং, ভালো কোম্পানি বাজারে আনার পথ সহজ করার মাধ্যমে বাজারে ভালো শেয়ারের সরবরাহ বাড়াতে হবে। এতে ব্যাংকঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরতা কমবে। অন্যদিকে শক্তিশালী করপোরেট সুশাসন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। এ জন্য স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জগুলোকেও শক্তিশালী করতে হবে। যাতে স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের পক্ষ থেকে বাজারে তদারকি জোরদার করা যায়। সেটি হলে বিনিয়োগকারীদের সুরক্ষা বাড়বে। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির ক্ষেত্রে কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হচ্ছে সংস্কার। পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা বিএসইসির কার্যকারিতা এবং জবাবদিহি বাড়ানোর পাশাপাশি রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত বিনিয়োগ সংস্থা ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করপোরেশন অব বাংলাদেশকে (আইসিবি) পুনরুজ্জীবিত করতে হবে। তাতে নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার প্রতি বিনিয়োগকারীদের বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা বাড়বে। এ ছাড়া, আন্তসংস্থা সমন্বয় এবং উন্নত আর্থিক সাক্ষরতা অত্যন্ত জরুরি। সেই সঙ্গে বেসরকারি খাতের কোম্পানির তালিকাভুক্তিতে প্রণোদনা এবং সঞ্চয়পত্রের সুদহারের যৌক্তিকীকরণের মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক ও পুঁজিবাজারের মধ্যে ভারসাম্য আনতে হবে, তাতে বাজারে তারল্য সরবরাহ বাড়বে। পুঁজিবাজারের টেকসই প্রবৃদ্ধি নির্ভর করে একটি শক্তিশালী প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারী ভিত্তি তৈরির ওপর। তার জন্য জরুরি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড শিল্পের বিকাশ। পেশাদার তহবিল ব্যবস্থাপকদের মাধ্যমে পরিচালিত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে বাজারে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বিনিয়োগের সংস্কৃতিও তৈরি হবে। তাতে বাজারে অস্থিরতা কমবে; কিন্তু দুঃখজনকভাবে দেশের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড খাতটি এখনো প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে রয়েছে। ভারতের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার দেশটির জিডিপির প্রায় ২০ শতাংশ। সেখানে বাংলাদেশে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার জিডিপির মাত্র শূন্য দশমিক ২ শতাংশ। পুঁজিবাজারকে যদি মৌলিক ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করাতে হয়, তবে এই অনুপাত উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বাড়াতে হবে। এ জন্য প্রয়োজন লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিসহায়তা। মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে বিনিয়োগের কর রেয়াত সুবিধা ১৫ শতাংশ থেকে বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা, ৫ লাখ টাকা পর্যন্ত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের লভ্যাংশ আয়কে করমুক্ত রাখা এবং আইপিওতে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের কোটা বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা হলে তাতে খাতটি বড় হবে। এ ছাড়া বেমেয়াদি ও মেয়াদি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে ব্যাংকের বিনিয়োগের ওপর বিদ্যমান ১৫ শতাংশের সীমা তুলে নেওয়া প্রয়োজন। কারণ, এই সীমাবদ্ধতা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক পুঁজি বিনিয়োগকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করছে। যদি এই সংস্কারগুলো ধারাবাহিকভাবে বাস্তবায়ন করা যায়, তবে দেশের পুঁজিবাজারও দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধির একটি শক্তিশালী ভিতে পরিণত হবে। লেখক পরিচিতি: ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক ও প্রধান নির্বাহী, ভ্যানগার্ড অ্যাসেট ম্যানেজমেন্ট",

        "body": "শারীরিক প্রতিবন্ধী আবদুল হামিদের (৬৫) সংসারে তিনি আর তাঁর স্ত্রী। ছোট্ট একটি বসতভিটাই তাঁদের একমাত্র সম্বল। ভিক্ষাবৃত্তিতেই চলে সংসার। মাস শেষে হাতে আসে ১০ থেকে ১২ হাজার টাকা। আজ মঙ্গলবার ভোরে ঘর থেকে বের হয়েছিলেন হামিদ। সকাল থেকে দুপুর পর্যন্ত রোদে আর প্রচণ্ড গরমে ঘুরে পেয়েছেন ২০০ টাকা। সেই টাকা নিয়েই পা বাড়ান বাজারের দিকে। কিনেছেন ২৫০ গ্রাম রসুন, একটি লাউ, কিছু আলু আর কয়েক আঁটি শাক। এতেই শেষ হয়ে যায় তাঁর দিনের সম্বল। মাছ-মাংসের দোকানের দিকে একবার তাকিয়েছিলেন বটে, কিন্তু পা বাড়াতে পারেননি। চোখে ছিল কেবল অসহায় এক দীর্ঘশ্বাস। শাকসবজি হাতে ধীরে ধীরে ফিরে যাচ্ছিলেন বাড়ির পথে। আজ দুপুর ১২টার দিকে জামালপুর শহরের সকাল বাজারে কথা হয় আবদুল হামিদের সঙ্গে। তাঁর বাড়ি ইসলামপুর উপজেলার কলাবান্দা এলাকায়। শরীর ভালো থাকলে তিনি প্রতিদিন জামালপুর শহরে ভিক্ষা করতে আসেন। তাঁর এক ছেলে ও দুই মেয়ে। সবার বিয়ে হয়ে গেছে। একমাত্র ছেলে স্ত্রী-সন্তান নিয়ে ঢাকায় থাকেন, কিন্তু মা–বাবার খোঁজখবর রাখেন না। একসময় রিকশা চালাতেন হামিদ। কিন্তু পায়ের সমস্যার কারণে এখন আর পারেন না। তাই ভিক্ষা করেই কোনো রকমে স্ত্রীকে নিয়ে দিন কাটান। আবদুল হামিদ বলেন, ‘বাজারে জিনিসপত্রের দাম শুনি মাথা ঘুরি যায়। কত কষ্ট করে কইটা ট্যাহা পাই। সেই ট্যাহা নিয়ে বাজারে গেলে কোনোডারই লাগাল পাই না। শাক, আলু আর বেগুনের যে দাম, মাছ-গোশত কিনার সাহস পাইনে। দেহুন ওই সকাল থ্যাইকা যে কইডা ট্যাহা পাইলাম, লাউ, আলু আর শাক কিনতেই শেষ। দুজন মানুষ খাই, তাই চলতি পারছি না।’ জামালপুর শহরের সবচেয়ে বড় সকাল বাজার ঘুরে আজ সকাল থেকে দুপুর ১২টা পর্যন্ত দেখা গেছে, পেঁয়াজ বিক্রি হচ্ছে ৭০ টাকা কেজি দরে, বেগুন ১২০ থেকে ১৪০, আলু ২৫, মরিচ ১৫০ থেকে ১৬০, শসা ৮০ থেকে ১০০, করলা ৮০ থেকে ১০০, টমেটো ১০০ থেকে ১২০, শিম ১৫০ থেকে ১৬০, পেঁপে ২০, পটোল ৫০ থেকে ৬০, বরবটি ১০০, লেবু ৮০, ঢ্যাঁড়স ৬৫, বিভিন্ন শাক ৪০ এবং মিষ্টিকুমড়া ৬০ টাকা কেজি দরে বিক্রি হচ্ছে। লাউ প্রতিটি ৮০ থেকে ৯০ টাকায় বিক্রি হচ্ছে। শহরের শফি মিয়ার বাজার, বানিয়া বাজার, ফৌজদারি মোড় বাজার ও বউ বাজারেও প্রায় একই দামে এসব শাকসবজি বিক্রি হচ্ছে। সকাল বাজারের সবজির দোকানি রাফিউল ইসলামের দোকানে সবজি কিনতে আসেন শহরের ভোকেশনাল মোড় এলাকার বাসিন্দা মোহাম্মদ কাফি। তিনি বলেন, ‘প্রায় শীত চলে আসছে। তারপরও বাজারে সবজির দাম কমেনি। আগের মতোই সব সবজির দাম। সবজি কিনতেই জীবন শেষ। মাছ-মাংসের চিন্তা করার সাহসই পাই না। ছোট্ট একটা চায়ের দোকান চালাই, মাসে ১৫-১৬ হাজার টাকা আয় হয়। এর বেশির ভাগই যায় দোকানভাড়া, বিদ্যুৎ বিল আর ছেলে-মেয়ের লেখাপড়ায়। অনেক মাসে ঋণ করে সংসার চালাতে হয়। বাজারে জিনিসপত্রের দাম শুনে মাথা ঘুরে যায়। তাই কম কম কিনে কোনো রকমে চলছি। সংসার চালাতে হিমশিম খাচ্ছি।’ দাম বাড়ার কারণ জানতে চাইলে বিক্রেতা রাফিউল ইসলাম বলেন, বেশি দামে সবজি কিনতে হয়েছে, তাই বেশি দামে বিক্রি করছে। তবে এই সপ্তাহে কোনো সবজির দাম বাড়েনি, আগের দামই রয়েছে। কয়েক সপ্তাহের মধ্যে কিছু সবজির দাম কমতে পারে। সামনে শীত আসছে, তখন সবজির সরবরাহ বাড়বে। নভেম্বরের প্রথম সপ্তাহ থেকে দাম কিছুটা কমবে। বাড়তি দামে সবজি কিনতে গিয়ে ঘাম ঝরছে নিম্ন আয়ের মানুষের। ক্রেতাদের অভিযোগ, বাজারে কোনো কিছুই এখন নাগালের মধ্যে নেই। চাহিদা ও সরবরাহের অসামঞ্জস্য, আর মধ্যস্বত্বভোগীদের হাতবদলে দাম বেড়ে যাচ্ছে। এতে প্রতিদিনের কেনাকাটায় অতিরিক্ত খরচ মেটাতে হিমশিম খেতে হচ্ছে। অন্যদিকে বিক্রেতারা বলছেন, এবার টানা বৃষ্টির কারণে সবজিখেত ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়েছে। ফলে সরবরাহ কমেছে। শীত মৌসুমের আগে শাকসবজির উৎপাদন কম হওয়ায় পাইকারি বাজারেও সরবরাহে ঘাটতি দেখা দিয়েছে, তাই দাম কমছে না। তবে নভেম্বর মাসে দাম কিছুটা কমবে বলে আশা করছেন তাঁরা। জামালপুরের কৃষি সম্প্রসারণ অধিদপ্তরের উপপরিচালক মোহাম্মদ আলম শরিফ খান বলেন, এবার দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে বৃষ্টি হয়েছে। ফলে কৃষক আগাম সবজি চাষ করতে পারেননি। যেটুকু করেছেন, তার বেশির ভাগই নষ্ট হয়েছে। তাই বাজারে সবজির সরবরাহ কম। সরবরাহ কম থাকায় দামও কমছে না। তবে আগামী মাসের মধ্যে শীতের সবজি আসবে, তখন দামও কমে যাবে।",

        "title": "Salehuddin: Interim govt to leave Bangladesh’s economy in a satisfactory position",
        "body": "Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed on Wednesday said the interim government would leave Bangladesh’s economy in a “satisfactory and stable” position for the next elected government.\n\n“I believe we’re leaving the economy in a satisfactory place. The next government will not face major difficulties in continuing from here. The situation is stable now — not shaky like before,” he said.\n\nDr Salehuddin, however, acknowledged that significant challenges remain ahead.\n\nThe finance adviser was responding to the queries of reporters after chairing the 5th meeting of the Advisers Council Committee on Government Purchase held on Wednesday at the Cabinet Division Conference Room at Bangladesh Secretariat.\n\nHe said the economy is no longer in a fragile or unstable condition, unlike previous periods, and that the foundations have been stabilized to allow future governments to move forward.\n\nWhen asked whether the government had taken on record levels of debt, the finance adviser said that while borrowings had increased, a substantial amount of external debt had also been repaid.\n\n“Yes, borrowing increased, but we also repaid around six billion dollars in external debt. Debt repayment is equally important,” he said, adding that many large, expensive infrastructure projects were deliberately avoided.\n\n“We didn’t go for costly mega projects like tunnels or projects worth thousands of crores through loans. That is why public debt pressure didn’t worsen further,” he said.\n\nHe admitted that employment generation remained one of the government’s biggest challenges, largely because job creation requires sustained support for small and medium industries.\n\n“Our major challenge was employment generation. For that, small and medium enterprises are essential. But we didn’t have enough fiscal space. Large factories are not labour-intensive, and they come with many complexities,” he explained.\n\nAddressing concerns over contradictory statements about future economic risks, Dr Salehuddin clarified that while the economy is stable, reforms need to be consolidated and carried forward carefully.\n\n“What we have done is not a one-off solution. To take it forward, it needs to be strengthened further. That itself is a big challenge,” he said, noting that access to concessional foreign aid has declined.\n\nHe stressed that reforms require time, cooperation and procedural discipline, which are often difficult in Bangladesh’s complex administrative system.\n\n“Reform is not just about speeches. It requires process, cooperation and patience. Inside the system, procedures are extremely complicated. Without cooperation, it becomes very difficult,” he said.\n\nHighlighting governance reforms, Dr Salehuddin Ahmed said the government has made significant progress in digitising land records and khatian maps, making services cheaper and more accessible to citizens.\n\n“Porcha and land records are being digitized. Now people can get services for Tk20, which earlier cost Tk500. We are expanding digital access nationwide,” he said.\n\nHe described the initiative as one of the most fundamental service delivery reforms, reducing harassment and improving transparency.\n\nDr Salehuddin also confirmed that the government is preparing to face international arbitration over alleged financial disputes and money laundering allegations involving business interests linked to S Alam Group.\n\nHe said a case has been filed at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a World Bank-affiliated arbitration body, following complaints lodged by the concerned party.\n\n“They have gone for arbitration at the World Bank forum. We’ve received notice and must respond. This is a very serious matter involving a large amount of money,” he said.\n\nThe government has decided to engage international legal counsel to contest the case, he added.\n\n“We will engage a legal firm. This is not a simple issue. Legal preparation is essential,” he said, though he declined to disclose the name of the firm at this stage.\n\nA government team is expected to visit Washington, DC, to deal with the arbitration process, he said.\n\nOn power sector reforms, the finance adviser said electricity tariffs are being rationalized rather than increased arbitrarily.\n\n“This is tariff restructuring, not a price hike. Money is being adjusted from one segment to another. It will not affect electricity supply,” he said, adding that efficiency issues at power plants such as Ashuganj are also under review.\n\nDr Salehuddin said, despite criticism, many fundamental reforms had been undertaken, even if they were not always visible.\n\n“People say nothing has been done because they only look for visible projects. But many fundamental procedural reforms have taken place. If someone does not want to see, they will not see,” he remarked.",

        "title": "BNP will ensure economic democratisation if elected: Amir Khasru",
        "body": "Economic democratisation would be implemented if the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) comes to power through people's votes, BNP Standing Committee member and former commerce minister Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said today (22 December). \"Democracy cannot be established through political change alone if people are excluded from economic participation and do not share in the benefits of growth. If real democracy is to be established, the economic rights of the people of Bangladesh must be restored. We do not want to see politics based on patronage in the country,\" he said while speaking as the chief guest at a programme at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Chattogram Bay View. The event was a business dialogue on trade, commerce, the economy and investment, organised by the Chattogram Divisional Business Forum, with representatives from various business forums and trade bodies of the division in attendance. He said businesspeople had told him they want to operate in a supportive environment, with clear policies and the freedom to do business. \"Bangladesh is a highly regulated country. Opening a restaurant requires approvals from 19 to 21 authorities, while obtaining environmental clearance for shipbreaking can take up to two months,\" he said. \"We have to move away from a situation where every business is overregulated across sectors,\" he added. \"So our policy is to pursue serious deregulation,\" he said, adding that Bangladesh ranks very low in terms of economic liberalisation and ease of doing business. Recalling his tenure as commerce minister, Amir Khasru said leaders of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) once told him they needed utilisation declaration certificates, which were then issued by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB). He said obtaining these certificates involved harassment and demands for unofficial payments. \"Businesspeople asked me to 'fix' the EPB. Since it was powerful, I told them the authority to issue utilisation declaration certificates should be taken out of the bureau and handed over to the BGMEA. Now they issue the certificates themselves,\" he said. He added that many protests were launched against him over the decision because issuing the certificates had been a source of cash income for the bureau. \"If we are given responsibility in the future, we will remove whatever is being blocked by bureaucracy,\" he said. \"We will ask business organisations to build capacity and operate properly, professionally, independently and transparently, so that many responsibilities of the government can be handed over to them,\" he added. Emphasising the need to expand employment, Amir Khasru said small and medium enterprises are the main contributors to the economy. \"Economic growth is not possible without increasing employment, and gross domestic product will not rise unless job creation expands,\" he said. \"BNP has pledged to build a $500 trillion economy, but this would not be possible without the growth of small and medium enterprises,\" he added. To support this, he said facilities such as bonded warehouses and back-to-back letters of credit, similar to those available in the readymade garment sector, would be ensured for all export-oriented sectors. \"There should be no need for businesses to move from office to office,\" he said, adding that automation must be introduced to reduce physical contact. \"Physical contact between businesspeople and government officials must be kept to a minimum,\" he said, adding that this should apply not only to businesses but also to ordinary citizens. He also said technology would be used in the future to reduce harassment at ports and shorten container release times. \"Only 2% of cargo will be inspected, and that too through algorithms and software,\" he said. \"As a result, there will be no discretionary decision-making by customs officials. Corruption and extortion will no longer exist,\" he added. During the dialogue, businesspeople raised various problems they face and spoke about sector-specific barriers and possible solutions.

যদিও শিক্ষার নিম্নমান ও প্রয়োজনীয় দক্ষতার অভাবে তরুণদের কর্মক্ষমতা কম। এই বাস্তবতায় তরুণেরা নিজেদের বঞ্চিত ও প্রতারিত বোধ করতেন; সেখান থেকেই অভ্যুত্থানের প্রেরণা। বাংলাদেশের ১৭ কোটি মানুষের মধ্যে প্রায় অর্ধেকের বয়স ৩০-এর নিচে। বিষয়টি এত দিন জনসংখ্যাগত সুবিধা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতো। কিন্তু বিশ্লেষকেরা এখন বলছেন, উৎপাদনশীল কর্মসংস্থান না হলে এই সুবিধা অভিশাপে পরিণত হতে পারে। বাংলাদেশের ক্ষেত্রে ঠিক সেটাই হয়েছে। আন্তর্জাতিক শ্রম সংস্থার (আইএলও) তথ্যানুসারে, ২০২৩ সালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী তরুণদের বেকারত্বের হার ছিল ১৫ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ। এই বাস্তবতায় দেশের তরুণদের এই অভ্যুত্থান বলে কোনো কোনো বিশ্লেষক মনে করেন। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা অনেক দিন ধরেই বলে আসছেন, গত দেড় দশকে বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে উচ্চ প্রবৃদ্ধি হলেও কর্মসংস্থান সেভাবে হয়নি। তাঁদের ভাষ্যমতে, এটা হলো কর্মসংস্থানহীন প্রবৃদ্ধি। তাই বিদ্যমান বাস্তবতায় মুহাম্মদ ইউনূস সরকারের সবচেয়ে বড় কাজগুলোর মধ্যে অন্যতম হবে কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টি করা। তা না হলে বঞ্চনা ও প্রতারিত হওয়ার বোধ তরুণদের বুকের মধ্যে আগের মতোই ধিকিধিকি জ্বলবে। ডয়চে ভেলে বলছে, অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের জন্য আরেকটি বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ হলো মূল্যস্ফীতি। দেড় বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে রয়েছে। বলা যায়, দুই বছর ধরে দেশের মানুষের ক্ষোভের মূল কারণ হলো উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি। বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করেন, রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর থেকে যে পরিস্থিতি সৃষ্টি হয়েছে, বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক তা যথাযথভাবে মোকাবিলা করতে পারেনি। শেখ হাসিনা সরকারের পতনের পর কলকারখানা ও অর্থনৈতিক কার্যক্রম এখনো পুরোপুরি চালু হয়নি। ডয়চে ভেলে মনে করছে, এই মুহূর্তে ইউনূস সরকারের মূল লক্ষ্য হলো, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় পুরোপুরি সচল করা। তারা বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের কথা বলেছে। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, বাংলাদেশে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি না হলে তৈরি পোশাকের ক্রেতারা মুখ ফিরিয়ে নিতে পারেন। তবে অনতিবিলম্বে আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতির উন্নতি হলে এই খাতে দীর্ঘ মেয়াদি প্রভাব পড়বে না। আন্তর্জাতিক বিশ্লেষকেরা মনে করছেন, অর্থনীতি পুনরায় সচল করার পাশাপাশি দীর্ঘদিন ধরে যেসব সমস্যা রয়েছে, সেগুলো নিরসনে কাঠামোগত সংস্কারে হাত দিতে হবে। যেমন নিয়ন্ত্রক প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোর সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধি, দুর্নীতি দূরীকরণ, ব্যাংকিং ও আর্থিক খাতে স্থিতিশীলতা ফিরিয়ে আনা, কর ও শুল্কনীতির সংস্কার ইত্যাদি। এসব সমস্যার সমাধানে সরকারের উচিত হবে একাধিক বিশেষজ্ঞ প্যানেল তৈরি করা। এসব শুরু করতে দেরি করা যাবে না, সেটাই হলো বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। ইকোনমিক টাইমস বলছে, ২০১১ থেকে ২০১৯ সাল পর্যন্ত বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতিতে গড় প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ছিল ৬ শতাংশের ওপরে। এই সময়ে মাথাপিছু আয় দ্বিগুণ হয়েছে। ২০১৬ সালের পর মূল্যস্ফীতির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে নেমে আসে। এরপর ২০২০ সালে শুরু হয় কোভিড-১৯ মহামারি। ওই সময় রপ্তানি কমে যায়। রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর আরেকবার ধাক্কা খায় বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি। সর্বশেষ ২০২৩-২৪ অর্থবছরের চূড়ান্ত প্রবৃদ্ধির হার ৬ শতাংশের নিচে থাকবে বলেই ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির কারণে মানুষের কষ্ট বেড়েছে। দেশীয় মুদ্রা টাকার অবমূল্যায়নের কারণে মার্কিন ডলারের নিরিখে জনগণের মাথাপিছু আয় কমে গেছে। সেই সঙ্গে উচ্চ বেকারত্বের কারণে তরুণদের মধ্যে যে ক্ষোভ-বিক্ষোভ দানা বেঁধে ওঠে, তা-ই শেষমেশ হাসিনার পতনের কারণ হয়ে দাঁড়ায় বলে মনে করে ইকোনমিক টাইমস। ইকোনমিক টাইমস আরও বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের অর্থনীতি তৈরি পোশাক ও বস্ত্র খাতের ওপর অতিমাত্রায় নির্ভরশীল হয়ে পড়েছিল। গত ১৫ বছরে অবকাঠামোগত অনেক উন্নয়ন হলেও এ দেশের অর্থনীতির বহুমুখীকরণ হয়নি। মার্কিন-চীন বাণিজ্যযুদ্ধের কারণে বৈশ্বিক ব্র্যান্ডগুলো চায়না প্লাস ওয়ান কৌশল গ্রহণ করেছে। অর্থাৎ তারা চীন থেকে উৎপাদন সরিয়ে নেওয়ার পক্ষপাতী। এ ক্ষেত্রে বাংলাদেশ আকর্ষণীয় গন্তব্য হতে পারে বলে অনেকেই ধারণা করছিলেন। কিন্তু আন্তর্জাতিক বিশেষজ্ঞদের উদ্ধৃত করে আল–জাজিরা জানায়, বাস্তবতা হলো, রাজনৈতিক অস্থিতিশীলতার কারণে বাংলাদেশের বিষয়ে বিনিয়োগকারীরা ভিন্ন চিন্তা করতে পারেন। বর্তমান পরিস্থিতিতে সবার আগে দরকার হলো আইনশৃঙ্খলা পুনরুদ্ধার। কর্মসংস্থানের বিষয়টি আল-জাজিরাও উল্লেখ করেছে। তারা বলেছে, বাংলাদেশের এক-চতুর্থাংশ মানুষের বয়স ১৫ থেকে ২৯ বছর। গত দুই দশকে এই দেশের অর্থনীতিতে উল্লেখযোগ্য হারে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু বৈষম্যও বেড়েছে অনেক বেশি। এ ছাড়া ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সী জনগোষ্ঠীর প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ কোনো কাজে, প্রশিক্ষণে বা শিক্ষায় নেই। এদিকে কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মধ্যেই বৈশ্বিক ঋণমান নির্ণয়কারী সংস্থা এসঅ্যান্ডপি বাংলাদেশের ঋণমান অবনমন করেছে। মূলত অর্থনীতির বহিঃস্থ খাতের দুর্বলতার কারণে তারা ঋণমান অবনমন করে। এসঅ্যান্ডপি আরও বলেছে, গত জুন মাসের শেষে বাংলাদেশের বৈদেশিক রিজার্ভের পরিমাণ ছিল ২১ দশমিক ৭৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার। এই পরিমাণ রিজার্ভ দিয়ে দেশের তিন মাসের আমদানি ব্যয় মেটানো যেতে পারে। কিন্তু কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনকে কেন্দ্র করে জুলাই মাসে যে সহিংসতা দেখা দেয়, তার রাশ টানতে সরকার কারফিউ জারি করে ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ রাখে। এর প্রভাবে দেশের রিজার্ভ কমতে পারে বলে মনে করে এসঅ্যান্ডপি। বিশেষ করে তৈরি পোশাক খাতের ব্যবসা ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়ায় রপ্তানি আয় কমতে পারে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলেন, ইন্টারনেট বন্ধ থাকায় বিশ্ববাণিজ্যে বাংলাদেশের ভাবমূর্তি ক্ষুণ্ন হতে পারে। এই সংকট কাটিয়ে উঠতে সময় লাগবে।",

        "body": "প্রতিবেশী ইরানের সঙ্গে ভূরাজনৈতিক উত্তেজনা পাকিস্তানের খুঁড়িয়ে চলা অর্থনীতিকে রীতিমতো ঝাঁকি দিয়েছে। দেশটির শেয়ারবাজার এর ফলে পড়ে গেছে, আর বড় ধাক্কা খেয়েছে ডলার বন্ড। রয়টার্স জানিয়েছে, বালুচ বিদ্রোহীদের লক্ষ্য করে আজ বৃহস্পতিবার ইরানের ভেতরে হামলা চালিয়েছে পাকিস্তান। দুই দিন আগে তেহরান জানিয়েছিল যে আরেকটি গোষ্ঠীর ঘাঁটি লক্ষ্য করে তারা পাকিস্তানের ভেতরে হামলা চালিয়েছে। ইরানের ওই হামলার পর পাকিস্তান তাদের হামলার কথা জানাল। তেহরানের সঙ্গে ইসলামাবাদের এই মুখোমুখি হওয়ার ঘটনা এমন সময় ঘটেছে, যখন পাকিস্তানের অর্থনীতি মারাত্মক সংকটের ভেতর দিয়ে যাচ্ছে। দেশটির অর্থনীতির আকার ৩৫ হাজার কোটি ডলার। কিন্তু এই অর্থনীতির বড় সমস্যা উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি এবং ক্রমেই বেড়ে চলা রাজস্ব ও চলতি হিসাবের বিশাল ঘাটতি। আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল (আইএমএফ) পাকিস্তানকে ৩০০ ডলার ঋণ দিয়েছে। কিন্তু এর জন্য মানতে হচ্ছে কঠিন সব শর্ত। এই ঋণ পাকিস্তানকে গত গ্রীষ্মে খেলাপি হওয়া থেকে রক্ষা করেছে। ইরানের অভ্যন্তরে হামলা চালানো হয়েছে, পাকিস্তানের পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয় বৃহস্পতিবার এমন কথা জানানোর পর দেশটির ছাড়া আন্তর্জাতিক বন্ডের মূল্যপতন ঘটেছে। যেসব বন্ডের দাম সবচেয়ে বেশি কমেছে, তার মধ্যে রয়েছে ২০২৬ বন্ড হিসেবে পরিচিত একটি বন্ড। দিনের শুরুতে পাকিস্তানের মূল শেয়ার সূচক ১ দশমিক ৬ শতাংশ পড়ে যায়। পরের দিকে সূচক অবশ্য খানিকটা বাড়ে। ইরানের সঙ্গে পাকিস্তানের খুব বড় ধরনের অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ক নেই। তবে সেই দ্বিপক্ষীয় সম্পর্কও পাকিস্তানের জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। পাকিস্তানের সর্ব পশ্চিমের প্রদেশ হলো বালুচিস্তান। সেখানে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ পণ্য পাঠাতে পাকিস্তানকে রীতিমতো সংগ্রাম করতে হয়, বিশেষ করে জ্বালানি ও বিদ্যুৎ। পাকিস্তানের অনেক এলাকায় বিদ্যুৎ আসে ইরান থেকে। আর অনানুষ্ঠানিকভাবে দুই দেশের মধ্যে অনেক পণ্যের লেনদেন হয়। এসব পণ্যের মধ্যে রয়েছে তরল পেট্রোলিয়াম গ্যাস (এলপিজি) ও ইরানের ডিজেল। গত বছর জুন মাসে পাকিস্তান একটি বিশেষ আদেশের মাধ্যমে ইরানের সঙ্গে সীমান্ত বাণিজ্য চালু করে। পেট্রোলিয়াম ও প্রাকৃতিক গ্যাসসহ বেশ কয়েকটি পণ্য সীমান্ত বাণিজ্যে লেনদেন হয়। একই ধরনের বাণিজ্যব্যবস্থা আফগানিস্তান ও রাশিয়ার সঙ্গেও চালু করেছে পাকিস্তান। ইসলামাবাদ পলিসি রিসার্চ ইনস্টিটিউটের অর্থনৈতিক নিরাপত্তা বিভাগের চেয়ার আনীল সালমান বলেন, ‘দুই দেশের মধ্যে যে ২০০ কোটি ডলারের বাণিজ্য হয়, তা দেশ দুটোর জন্য গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। বিশেষ করে বালুচিস্তানের মতো এলাকার জন্য। এই এলাকার মানুষ ইরানের সঙ্গে বাণিজ্যের ওপর অনেকটাই নির্ভরশীল। বিশেষ করে কৃষিপণ্য ও পেট্রোকেমিক্যালের জন্য।’ আনীল সালমান আরও বলেন, বাণিজ্যে যেকোনো ধরনের বাধা পড়লে তার অর্থনৈতিক প্রতিক্রিয়া থাকবে। পাকিস্তানে পণ্যের ঘাটতি হবে। আর দুই দেশের মধ্যকার ২০০ কোটি ডলারের বাণিজ্যও কমে যাবে। পাকিস্তান ও ইরানের মধ্যে একটি গ্যাস পাইপলাইন নির্মাণ করা হচ্ছে। এটি পরিচিত পিস পাইপলাইন বা শান্তির পাইপলাইন হিসেবে। আনীল সালমান মনে করেন, দুই দেশের মধ্যে সংঘাত দীর্ঘমেয়াদি এই প্রকল্পে বড় রকমের প্রভাব রাখবে। এই পাইপলাইনের মাধ্যমে ইরান থেকে পাকিস্তানে গ্যাস পরিবহন করার কথা। পাইপলাইনটি ব্যবহার করে ভারতে গ্যাস যাবে, এমন সম্ভাবনাও রয়েছে। এর বাস্তবায়ন এরই মধ্যে পিছিয়ে গেছে। সংঘাতের কারণে এই প্রকল্প আরও পিছিয়ে যেতে পারে। একই সঙ্গে এর জন্য বিনিয়োগ পাওয়া আরও কঠিন হতে পারে। দেশ দুটি ২০২৩ সালের আগস্টে পাঁচ বছর মেয়াদি একটি বাণিজ্য চুক্তি করে। তাদের লক্ষ্য দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্যের পরিমাণ ৫০০ কোটি ডলারে উন্নীত করা। টেলিমারের ইকুইটি গবেষণা বিভাগের প্রধান হাসনাইন মালিক বলেন, বাইরে থেকে দেখে মনে হচ্ছে এই সংঘাত বাড়বে না। কিন্তু এটাও মনে রাখতে হবে সর্বশেষ এ ঘটনা এমন সময় ঘটেছে, যখন পাকিস্তান যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক উন্নয়নের জন্য চেষ্টা চালিয়ে যাচ্ছে।",

        "body": "যত দূর মনে পড়ে, আমরা অর্থনীতি বা ব্যবসায় প্রশাসন পাঠকালে যখনই বিশ্বব্যাংক ও আইএমএফের কথা শুনেছি, তখন থেকেই জেনেছি রপ্তানি বাড়াতে স্থানীয় মুদ্রার অবমূল্যায়ন করতে হবে আর মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে মোক্ষম অস্ত্র হচ্ছে সুদের হার বৃদ্ধি। কিন্তু বেশ কিছুদিন ধরে দেখা যাচ্ছে, এই সুপারিশগুলো বিশেষ করে মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে সুদের হার বাড়ানোর অস্ত্র ভোঁতা হয়ে গেছে। সুদহার বাড়িয়ে মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণের যে প্রেসক্রিপশন আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল (আইএমএফ) থেকে দেওয়া হয়েছিল, সেটি বাংলাদেশে কাজে আসছে না বলে বিভিন্ন মহলে বেশ কিছুদিন থেকেই আলোচনা হচ্ছে। দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি আবারও বাড়তে শুরু করেছে। গত নভেম্বরের পর ডিসেম্বরেও মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে প্রায় সাড়ে ৮ শতাংশে উন্নীত হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে সরকার ও বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক যেসব পদক্ষেপ নিয়েছে, সেগুলোর কার্যকর সুফল মেলেনি। উল্টো সংকোচনমুখী মুদ্রানীতি প্রণয়ন ও ঋণের সুদহার বাড়িয়ে মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণের যে নীতি গ্রহণ করা হয়েছিল, সেটি সরবরাহব্যবস্থাকে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত করেছে। ঋণের অভাবে বেসরকারি খাত আরও দুর্বল হয়েছে। কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টির পথ রুদ্ধ হওয়ার পাশাপাশি মানুষের সার্বিক ক্রয়ক্ষমতা কমেছে। আমাদের শ্রেণিকক্ষে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির শিক্ষকেরা বুঝিয়েছেন, সাধারণত বাজারে অর্থপ্রবাহ বেড়ে গেলে এবং সে কারণে মূল্যস্ফীতি বাড়লে, অর্থপ্রবাহ কমাতে নীতি সুদহার বাড়াতে হয়। নীতি সুদহার বেড়ে গেলে দেশের ব্যাংকগুলো কেন্দ্রীয় ব্যাংক থেকে ঋণ নিতে নিরুৎসাহিত হয়। আবার বাণিজ্যিক ব্যাংকগুলো গ্রাহকদের যে ঋণ দেয়, তার সুদহারেও এর প্রভাব পড়ে। এতে গ্রাহকেরাও ঋণ গ্রহণে নিরুৎসাহিত হন। মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে আনতে ২০২৩ সাল থেকে সংকোচনমুখী মুদ্রানীতি প্রণয়ন করে কেন্দ্রীয় ব্যাংক। ছাত্র-জনতার অভ্যুত্থান তথা ২০২৪ সালের ৫ আগস্টের পর নীতি সুদহার আরও বাড়িয়ে ১০ শতাংশে উন্নীত করা হয়। কিন্তু সংকোচনমুখী মুদ্রানীতির কল্যাণেও বাজারে মূল্যস্ফীতি তেমন নিয়ন্ত্রণে আনা যায়নি। অনেকেরই ধারণা, বাংলাদেশে বর্তমান মূল্যস্ফীতিতে মুদ্রাপ্রবাহের পরিবর্তে বাজার ব্যবস্থাপনায় ব্যর্থতাই মূল ভূমিকা রাখছে। ফলে নীতি সুদহার বাড়ানোর খুব একটা প্রভাব মূল্যস্ফীতিতে দেখা যাচ্ছে না। নীতি সুদহার বাড়ানোয় উল্টো বেসরকারি খাতে ঋণপ্রবাহ কমেছে এবং এতে অর্থনৈতিক কর্মকাণ্ডের গতিশীলতা কমছে। গত বছর ঋণ প্রবৃদ্ধি অত্যন্ত মন্থর ছিল। কেন্দ্রীয় ব্যাংকের নীতি ও বাজারের অস্থিরতার কারণে বেসরকারি খাতে ঋণ দেওয়া হ্রাস পেয়েছে। রয়েছে বিনিয়োগে মন্দাও। দেশে নতুন বিনিয়োগ হয়নি, বিশেষ করে মূলধনি যন্ত্রপাতি আমদানি কমেছে, যা অর্থনীতির দীর্ঘমেয়াদি প্রবৃদ্ধির জন্য উদ্বেগের কারণ। উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির প্রভাবে নিত্যপ্রয়োজনীয় পণ্যের দাম বাড়ায় সাধারণ মানুষের ক্রয়ক্ষমতা কমেছে। পাশাপাশি বেড়েছে ব্যবসা পরিচালনার খরচ। রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতা এবং অন্তর্বর্তী সরকারের বিভিন্ন নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত বেসরকারি খাতে নেতিবাচক প্রভাব রেখেছে। বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের তথ্য বলছে, বেসরকারি খাতে ঋণ প্রবৃদ্ধি নেমে এসেছে মাত্র ৬ দশমিক ২৩ শতাংশে (অক্টোবর ২০২৫), যা এ খাতে আস্থার সংকটের একটি সরাসরি অর্থনৈতিক সূচক। এ সংকট স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠছে বিনিয়োগ ও ব্যবসা সম্প্রসারণ না করার সিদ্ধান্তে। ২০২৫ সালের জুলাই থেকে নভেম্বরে মূলধনি যন্ত্রপাতি আমদানির ঋণপত্র নিষ্পত্তি কমেছে ১৬ দশমিক ৭৭ শতাংশ, যা শিল্পায়নের ভবিষ্যৎ নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলছে। একই সঙ্গে জুনে শেষ হওয়া অর্থবছরে নতুন বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ (ইকুইটি ক্যাপিটাল) প্রবৃদ্ধি কমেছে ১৬ দশমিক ৯০ শতাংশ। আমরা দেখেছি, গত বছরজুড়ে দেশে সবজির বাজার বেশ চড়া ছিল। বিশেষ করে শীত মৌসুম শুরুর পরও গত নভেম্বর ও ডিসেম্বরে সবজির দাম তেমন কমেনি। ডিসেম্বরের শেষ দিকে কৃষক পর্যায়ে সবজির দামে বড় পতন হলেও তার সুফল ক্রেতা পর্যায়ে পৌঁছেনি। আবার গত বছর চাল, ডাল, চিনি, আটা, মাছ-মাংস, এলপিজিসহ বেশির ভাগ নিত্যপ্রয়োজনীয় পণ্যের দাম বেড়েছে। এ কারণে বছরজুড়ে মূল্যস্ফীতি প্রত্যাশিত মাত্রায় নামিয়ে আনা সম্ভব হয়নি। যদিও গত বছর বিশ্ববাজারে জ্বালানি তেলের দাম অনেকটা কমেছে। মূল্য কমেছে চাল, গম, সয়াবিন তেল, গুঁড়া দুধ, মসলাসহ বিভিন্ন পণ্যের। দামের পাশাপাশি গত বছর সমুদ্রপথে পণ্য পরিবহন ব্যয়ও কমেছে। তবে বিশ্ববাজারে দাম ও পরিবহন ব্যয় কমার সুফল বাংলাদেশের মানুষ পায়নি। উল্টো আগের দুই বছরের মতো বিদায়ী বছরজুড়েও তাঁদের ভুগতে হয়েছে উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতির চাপে। অন্যদিকে বিশ্ববাজারে কোনো পণ্যের দাম সামান্য বাড়লেও বাংলাদেশে তা খুব দ্রুতই বেশ বেড়ে যায়। এ পরিস্থিতিতে কেবল সুদহার বাড়িয়ে মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা কঠিন। মূল্যস্ফীতির রাশ টেনে ধরতে হলে বাজার ব্যবস্থাপনায় পদক্ষেপ লাগবে। বহুমুখী সরবরাহ শৃঙ্খল গড়ে তুলতে হবে। বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের পক্ষে একা কেবল সংকোচনমূলক মুদ্রানীতি দিয়ে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি কমানো সম্ভব নয়। বাংলাদেশের মতো দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে কেবল সুদহার না বাড়িয়ে সংশ্লিষ্ট অন্য সমস্যাগুলো সমাধানের দিকে আগেও বলেছি সমান নজর দিতে হবে। অগ্রাধিকার ভিত্তিতে বাজারে শৃঙ্খলা ফেরাতে হবে। এর জন্য কেবল বাজার তদারক করলেই চলবে না। বাজার সিন্ডিকেট ভাঙতে হবে। নিত্যপণ্যের বাজারে চাহিদামাফিক সরবরাহ নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। সে জন্য উৎপাদন পর্যায়ে ঘাটতি থাকলে আমদানির ব্যবস্থা করা উচিত। আমদানি বহুমুখীকরণসহ আমদানি-সংক্রান্ত জটিলতাগুলোও দূর করতে হবে। সর্বোপরি বাজার ব্যবস্থাপনায় যেসব অনিয়ম ও দুর্নীতি আছে, তা দূর করতে হবে। অনেক দিন থেকেই দেশে অভ্যন্তরীণ বাজার ব্যবস্থাপনা এবং বাজার পর্যবেক্ষণ অন্য অনেক সুশাসনের অভাব দেশের মতো দুর্বলভাবে পরিচালিত। কিছু অসাধু ব্যবসায়ী কৃত্রিম ঘাটতি সৃষ্টি করে সংকটকে কাজে লাগিয়ে কোনো যুক্তি ছাড়াই পণ্যের মূল্যকে অস্বাভাবিক বৃদ্ধি করে। বাজারের এ ধরনের কারসাজিও বন্ধ করতে হবে। মামুন রশীদ অর্থনীতি বিশ্লেষক",

        "body": "গত রাজনৈতিক সরকারের আমলে দেশের অর্থনৈতিক সাফল্যের যে গল্প শুনেছি আমরা, সেটি দাঁড়িয়ে ছিল এক নড়বড়ে ভিত্তির ওপর। প্রবৃদ্ধির চটকদার শিরোনামের আড়ালে চাপা পড়েছিল অর্থনীতির গভীর কাঠামোগত দুর্বলতা। বছরের পর বছর ধরে চলা অসামঞ্জস্যতা একদিকে বাড়িয়েছে ঋণের বোঝা, অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকিং খাতের অনিয়মের কারণে খেলাপি ঋণের হার পৌঁছেছে সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বের কয়টা দেশে ব্যাংক খাতের খেলাপি ঋণ ৩৫ শতাংশের বেশি, সেটি খুঁজে পাওয়া দুষ্কর। শুধু কি খেলাপি ঋণ? আস্থার সংকটে ২০২২ থেকে ২০২৪ সালের মাঝামাঝি সময়ের মধ্যে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ কমেছে প্রায় ৪০ শতাংশ। পুঁজি পাচার হয়েছে ব্যাপকভাবে। আর মূল্যস্ফীতি উঠেছিল এক যুগের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায়। সুদের হারের কৃত্রিম সীমা আরোপ এবং বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের টাকা ছাপানোর আগ্রাসী নীতি মূল্যস্ফীতির আগুনকে আরও উসকে দিয়েছিল। তথ্যের অস্বচ্ছতা পরিস্থিতির প্রকৃত ভয়াবহতাকে আড়াল করে রেখেছিল, যা শেষ পর্যন্ত রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতার পথ প্রশস্ত করে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থান এবং গণমানুষের দাবির মুখে গঠিত অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এরই মধ্যে সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিকে স্থিতিশীল করার ক্ষেত্রে দৃশ্যমান অগ্রগতি অর্জন করেছে। আমদানিতে কঠোরতা এবং বাজারভিত্তিক বিনিময় হার চালুর ফলে প্রবাসী আয়ে শক্তিশালী প্রবৃদ্ধি দেখা গেছে, যার সুবাদে বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার রিজার্ভ ৩০ শতাংশেরও বেশি পুনরুদ্ধার হয়েছে। মূল্যস্ফীতি কিছুটা সহনীয় পর্যায়ে এসেছে এবং সম্পদের গুণগত মান পর্যালোচনা ও কঠোর তদারকির মাধ্যমে খেলাপি ঋণ সংকট মোকাবিলায় প্রাথমিক পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়েছে। তবুও, এই ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর প্রক্রিয়াটি এখনো নাজুক। ব্যবসায়ীদের বিনিয়োগের আস্থায় চিড়, শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগ কমে যাওয়া এবং দীর্ঘস্থায়ী রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে গত বছর শেষে মোট দেশজ উৎপাদনের (জিডিপি) প্রবৃদ্ধি চার শতাংশের নিচে নামার শঙ্কা রয়েছে। এমন এক বাস্তবতায় রাজনৈতিক স্বচ্ছতা অর্থনীতির ভবিষ্যৎ নির্ধারণে বড় নির্ণায়ক হিসেবে দেখা দিয়েছে। নির্বাচিত সরকারের কাছে ক্ষমতা হস্তান্তরের প্রক্রিয়া নিয়ে সৃষ্ট অনিশ্চয়তা বিনিয়োগকারীদের মনোজগতে চাপ সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দীর্ঘ প্রবাস জীবনের পর তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফিরে আসায় সেই অনিশ্চয়তা কিছুটা কাটতে শুরু করে। তাঁকে ঘিরে ব্যবসায়ীসহ দেশবাসীর প্রত্যাশাও বেড়েছে। এটি মধ্য মেয়াদে অর্থনীতির জন্য একটি গঠনমূলক বা ইতিবাচকই বলা যায়। এই অবস্থায় আন্তর্জাতিক মুদ্রা তহবিল বা আইএমএফের পূর্বাভাসে বলা হয়েছে, চলতি বছর জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি প্রায় ৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত হতে পারে। এদিকে, সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতিতে কিছুটা স্থিতিশীলতা এলেও দেশের পুঁজিবাজার বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাঙ্ক্ষিত প্রত্যাশা পূরণে ব্যর্থ হচ্ছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) প্রধান সূচক ডিএসইএক্স বহু বছরের মধ্যে সর্বনিম্ন পর্যায়ে ঘোরাফেরা করছে। ভালো ভালো অনেক কোম্পানির শেয়ারের দাম কমে তলানিতে ঠেকেছে। আঞ্চলিক শেয়ারবাজারগুলোর উত্থান সত্ত্বেও আমাদের শেয়ারবাজারে বিদেশি বিনিয়োগকারীদের অংশগ্রহণ আশঙ্কাজনকভাবে কমে গেছে। এই পশ্চাৎপদতা মূলত কাঠামোগত। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ভালো মানের কোনো কোম্পানি বাজারে আসেনি। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার অদক্ষতা, ব্যাংক ঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরশীলতা, ফিক্সড ইনকাম বা সঞ্চয়পত্রের উচ্চ সুদ এবং প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারীর অভাব বাজারে তারল্য সংকট ও আস্থার ঘাটতিকে স্থায়ী রূপ দিয়েছে। বাংলাদেশ এখন একটি ঐতিহাসিক সন্ধিক্ষণে দাঁড়িয়ে আছে। সামষ্টিক অর্থনীতির স্থিতিশীলতা, রিজার্ভের উন্নতি এবং রাজনৈতিক উত্তরণ পুঁজিবাজারকে পুনরুজ্জীবিত করার একটি সংকীর্ণ কিন্তু অর্থবহ সুযোগ তৈরি করেছে। এই সুযোগ কাজে লাগিয়ে শেয়ারবাজারের টেকসই পুনরুদ্ধার নিশ্চিত করতে প্রয়োজন একটি সমন্বিত সংস্কার কর্মসূচি। তার জন্য কাঠামোগত বাধাগুলো দূর করার মাধ্যমে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বাজার উন্নয়নের পথ সুগম করতে হবে। ভালো কোম্পানি যাতে শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত হতে আগ্রহী হয় সে জন্য কোম্পানিগুলোকে রাজস্ব নীতির মাধ্যমে উৎসাহিত করা- এখন সময়ের দাবি। তালিকাভুক্ত এবং অ-তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানির করপোরেট করের ব্যবধান ১০ থেকে ১৫ শতাংশে উন্নীত করতে হবে। পাশাপাশি, করমুক্ত লভ্যাংশ বা ডিভিডেন্ড আয় জনগণকে শেয়ারবাজারমুখী করবে। বাজারে বিনিয়োগকারীর অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে, বাজারের গভীরতাও তত বাড়বে। একই সঙ্গে পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার সংস্কারও সমানভাবে জরুরি। একটি সুশৃঙ্খল বাজারের জন্য ডিজিটাল আর্থিক রিপোর্টিং, ভালো কোম্পানি বাজারে আনার পথ সহজ করার মাধ্যমে বাজারে ভালো শেয়ারের সরবরাহ বাড়াতে হবে। এতে ব্যাংকঋণের ওপর অতিনির্ভরতা কমবে। অন্যদিকে শক্তিশালী করপোরেট সুশাসন নিশ্চিত করতে হবে। এ জন্য স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জগুলোকেও শক্তিশালী করতে হবে। যাতে স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের পক্ষ থেকে বাজারে তদারকি জোরদার করা যায়। সেটি হলে বিনিয়োগকারীদের সুরক্ষা বাড়বে। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক সক্ষমতা বৃদ্ধির ক্ষেত্রে কেন্দ্রবিন্দু হচ্ছে সংস্কার। পুঁজিবাজার নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা বিএসইসির কার্যকারিতা এবং জবাবদিহি বাড়ানোর পাশাপাশি রাষ্ট্রায়ত্ত বিনিয়োগ সংস্থা ইনভেস্টমেন্ট করপোরেশন অব বাংলাদেশকে (আইসিবি) পুনরুজ্জীবিত করতে হবে। তাতে নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থার প্রতি বিনিয়োগকারীদের বিশ্বাসযোগ্যতা বাড়বে। এ ছাড়া, আন্তসংস্থা সমন্বয় এবং উন্নত আর্থিক সাক্ষরতা অত্যন্ত জরুরি। সেই সঙ্গে বেসরকারি খাতের কোম্পানির তালিকাভুক্তিতে প্রণোদনা এবং সঞ্চয়পত্রের সুদহারের যৌক্তিকীকরণের মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক ও পুঁজিবাজারের মধ্যে ভারসাম্য আনতে হবে, তাতে বাজারে তারল্য সরবরাহ বাড়বে। পুঁজিবাজারের টেকসই প্রবৃদ্ধি নির্ভর করে একটি শক্তিশালী প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বিনিয়োগকারী ভিত্তি তৈরির ওপর। তার জন্য জরুরি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড শিল্পের বিকাশ। পেশাদার তহবিল ব্যবস্থাপকদের মাধ্যমে পরিচালিত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের অংশগ্রহণ যত বাড়বে বাজারে দীর্ঘমেয়াদি বিনিয়োগের সংস্কৃতিও তৈরি হবে। তাতে বাজারে অস্থিরতা কমবে; কিন্তু দুঃখজনকভাবে দেশের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ড খাতটি এখনো প্রাথমিক পর্যায়ে রয়েছে। ভারতের মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার দেশটির জিডিপির প্রায় ২০ শতাংশ। সেখানে বাংলাদেশে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের বাজার জিডিপির মাত্র শূন্য দশমিক ২ শতাংশ। পুঁজিবাজারকে যদি মৌলিক ভিত্তির ওপর দাঁড় করাতে হয়, তবে এই অনুপাত উল্লেখযোগ্যভাবে বাড়াতে হবে। এ জন্য প্রয়োজন লক্ষ্যভিত্তিক নীতিসহায়তা। মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে বিনিয়োগের কর রেয়াত সুবিধা ১৫ শতাংশ থেকে বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা, ৫ লাখ টাকা পর্যন্ত মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের লভ্যাংশ আয়কে করমুক্ত রাখা এবং আইপিওতে মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডের কোটা বাড়িয়ে ২০ শতাংশ করা হলে তাতে খাতটি বড় হবে। এ ছাড়া বেমেয়াদি ও মেয়াদি মিউচুয়াল ফান্ডে ব্যাংকের বিনিয়োগের ওপর বিদ্যমান ১৫ শতাংশের সীমা তুলে নেওয়া প্রয়োজন। কারণ, এই সীমাবদ্ধতা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক পুঁজি বিনিয়োগকে বাধাগ্রস্ত করছে। যদি এই সংস্কারগুলো ধারাবাহিকভাবে বাস্তবায়ন করা যায়, তবে দেশের পুঁজিবাজারও দীর্ঘমেয়াদি অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধির একটি শক্তিশালী ভিতে পরিণত হবে। লেখক পরিচিতি: ব্যবস্থাপনা পরিচালক ও প্রধান নির্বাহী, ভ্যানগার্ড অ্যাসেট ম্যানেজমেন্ট",

        "body": "মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প ক্ষমতায় আসার পর থেকে বাণিজ্য নিয়ে যত ব্যবস্থা নিয়েছেন, তার মূল লক্ষ্য চীনের গতি রোধ করা। তা সত্ত্বেও চীনের প্রবৃদ্ধি একেবারে কম হচ্ছে না। ২০২৫ সালে চীনের প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ৫ শতাংশ। চীনের অর্থনীতির যে আকার বা তার যে নিকট অতীতে প্রবৃদ্ধি, তাতে এই ৫ শতাংশ প্রবৃদ্ধি যথেষ্ট না হলেও বিদ্যমান পরিস্থিতিতে তা খারাপ নয়, এমনটাই মনে করছেন বিশ্লেষকেরা। বিশ্বের দ্বিতীয় বৃহত্তম অর্থনীতির গতি কিছুটা মন্থর হয়েছে। একসময় দেশটির প্রবৃদ্ধি হতো ৮ শতাংশ হারে। আল–জাজিরার সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, ২০২৫ সালের অক্টোবর–ডিসেম্বর প্রান্তিকে বার্ষিক ভিত্তিতে প্রবৃদ্ধি হয়েছে ৪ দশমিক ৫ শতাংশ তৃতীয় প্রান্তিকে তা ছিল ৪ দশমিক ৮ শতাংশ, দ্বিতীয় প্রান্তিকে ৫ দশমিক ২ শতাংশ ও প্রথম প্রান্তিকে ৫ দশমিক ৪ শতাংশ। বিবৃতিতে জানানো হয়, চীনের জাতীয় পরিসংখ্যান ব্যুরো বলেছে, সামগ্রিকভাবে বলতে গেলে, বহুমুখী চাপের মধ্যেও ২০২৫ সালে জাতীয় অর্থনীতি স্থিতিশীল অগ্রগতি ধরে রেখেছে। উন্নয়নের গুণগত মান বেড়েছে। এ ক্ষেত্রে সফলতা এসেছে। চীন একসময় রপ্তানিমুখী প্রবৃদ্ধির ধারা থেকে বেরিয়ে অভ্যন্তরীণ ব্যয়নির্ভর প্রবৃদ্ধি অর্জনের নীতি গ্রহণ করে। দেশটির ওপর যত ধরনের শুল্ক বাধা আরোপ করা হয়েছে, তাতে সেই চেষ্টা যে তেমন একটা সফল হয়েছে, তা–ও নয়। বিবিসির সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, এক বছর ধরে চীনের অর্থনীতি অভ্যন্তরীণ ব্যয় বাড়ানোর চেষ্টা করেছে ঠিকই; কিন্তু তারা নানা বাধার মুখে পড়েছে। এর সঙ্গে যুক্ত হয়েছে দীর্ঘস্থায়ী আবাসন–সংকট এবং যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্পের শুল্কনীতির কারণে সৃষ্ট অস্থিরতা। বিশেষজ্ঞদের মতে, এসব পরিসংখ্যানে যে ইঙ্গিত পাওয়া যাচ্ছে, তা হলো ‘দুই ধাঁচের অর্থনীতি’। এটি হলো উৎপাদন খাতের কল্যাণে রপ্তানি প্রবৃদ্ধি ধরে রাখা গেলেও সাধারণ মানুষ এখনো ব্যয়ের বেলায় সতর্ক। সেই সঙ্গে আবাসন খাতের দুরবস্থা চীনের অর্থনীতির জন্য দীর্ঘস্থায়ী বিষফোড়া হয়ে আছে। বিবিসির সংবাদে বলা হয়েছে, চীনের সরকারি পরিসংখ্যান অনুযায়ী দেশটি প্রবৃদ্ধির লক্ষ্য অর্জন করেছে বলে মনে হলেও বিশ্লেষকদের মনে কিছু প্রশ্ন আছে। বিশেষ করে বিনিয়োগ ও ভোক্তা ব্যয়ের প্রেক্ষাপটে ওই তথ্যের নির্ভুলতা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলছেন কিছু বিশ্লেষক। ক্যাপিটাল ইকোনমিকসের চীনবিষয়ক অর্থনীতিবিদ জিচুন হুয়াং বলেন, ‘আমাদের ধারণা, প্রকৃত প্রবৃদ্ধি সরকারি হিসাবের চেয়ে কম।’ তাঁর মতে, সরকারি পরিসংখ্যানে অর্থনৈতিক সম্প্রসারণের গতি অন্তত ১ দশমিক ৫ শতাংশ পয়েন্ট বেশি দেখাচ্ছে। এদিকে সোমবার প্রকাশিত আরেক পরিসংখ্যানে দেখা গেছে, ১৯৪৯ সালে রেকর্ড রাখা শুরু হওয়ার পর গত বছর চীনে জন্মহার ছিল সর্বনিম্ন। চীনের জাতীয় পরিসংখ্যান ব্যুরোর তথ্য অনুযায়ী, ২০২৫ সালে দেশটিতে মোট ৭৯ লাখ শিশুর জন্ম হয়েছে। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলছেন, জন্মহার কমে যাওয়ায় আবাসন ও ভোক্তাপণ্যের চাহিদা আরও দুর্বল হবে। দেশটির আবাসন খাত এমনিতেই সংকটে আছে। নিম্ন জন্মহারের কারণে এই খাতের ওপর অতিরিক্ত চাপ সৃষ্টি হবে। সরকারি কর্মকর্তারা জানান, ২০২৫ সালে টানা চতুর্থ বছরের মতো চীনের জনসংখ্যা কমেছে। গত বছর জনসংখ্যা কমেছে ৩৪ লাখ। ফলে মোট জনসংখ্যা কমে দাঁড়িয়েছে প্রায় ১৪০ কোটিতে। এসব পরিসংখ্যান থেকে বোঝা যাচ্ছে, চীনের জনসংখ্যাগত সংকট গভীর হচ্ছে। এই পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে সরকার দম্পতিদের আরও সন্তান নিতে উৎসাহিত করতে নানা প্রণোদনা দিচ্ছে। বেইজিং গত বুধবার জানায়, ২০২৫ সালের তাদের ১ দশমিক ১৯ ট্রিলিয়ন বা ১ লাখ ১৯০ হাজার কোটি মার্কিন ডলারের বাণিজ্য উদ্বৃত্ত হয়েছে দেশটির ইতিহাসে যা সর্বোচ্চ। অর্থাৎ চীনের রপ্তানি ও আমদানির মধ্যে পার্থক্য বার্ষিক বাণিজ্য উদ্বৃত্ত এই প্রথম ১ ট্রিলিয়ন ডলার ছাড়িয়েছে, ২০২৪ সালে যা ছিল ৯৯৩ বিলিয়ন বা ৯৯ হাজার ৩০০ কোটি ডলার। গত বছর চীনের মাসিক রপ্তানি উদ্বৃত্ত ৭ মাস ১০০ বিলিয়ন ডলারের বেশি ছিল। তার মানে ট্রাম্পের পাল্টা শুল্ক সামগ্রিকভাবে বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশের সঙ্গে চীনের বাণিজ্যে তেমন প্রভাব ফেলতে পারেনি। উচ্চ শুল্কের কারণে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সঙ্গে চীনের বাণিজ্য দুর্বল হয়েছে ঠিকই, যদিও দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়া, আফ্রিকা ও লাতিন আমেরিকায় রপ্তানি বৃদ্ধির মাধ্যমে সেই ঘাটতি পুষিয়ে নিয়েছে দেশটি। চীনের কাস্টমসের উপপরিচালক ওয়াং জুন গত বুধবার সংবাদ সম্মেলনে বলেন, বৈশ্বিক বাণিজ্যে বড় পরিবর্তন ও বিভিন্ন চ্যালেঞ্জ সত্ত্বেও এই পরিসংখ্যান অসাধারণ। বিশ্বজুড়ে চীনের তৈরি পরিবেশবান্ধব প্রযুক্তি, কৃত্রিম বুদ্ধিমত্তাবিষয়ক পণ্য ও রোবোটিকসসহ বিভিন্ন পণ্যের চাহিদা বেড়ে যাওয়ায় দেশটির বিপুল পরিমাণ বাণিজ্য উদ্বৃত্ত হয়েছে। বিশেষ করে দক্ষিণ এশিয়া, আফ্রিকা ও ইউরোপের দেশগুলোর সঙ্গে চীনের বাণিজ্য বেড়েছে। অন্যদিকে রপ্তানির তুলনায় আমদানি কম হয়েছে। দ্বিতীয় মেয়াদে ক্ষমতায় এসে রীতিমতো লঙ্কাকাণ্ড বাধিয়েছেন মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প। বিশ্বের প্রায় সব দেশের পণ্যে পাল্টা শুল্ক আরোপ করেছেন। লক্ষ্য—এসব দেশের সঙ্গে মার্কিন বাণিজ্যঘাটতি কমিয়ে আনা। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সুবিধা হলো, তারা বিশ্বের সবচেয়ে বড় ক্রেতা। ফলে তারা শুল্কবাধা আরোপ করলে তাদের দেশে সংশ্লিষ্ট দেশের রপ্তানি কমে যায়; কিন্তু পৃথিবী ধীরে ধীরে মার্কিন–নির্ভরতা থেকে বেরিয়ে আসছে। চীনের ওপর এত বিধিনিষেধের পরও ২০২৫ সালে যে তাদের বাণিজ্য উদ্বৃত্ত নতুন রেকর্ড গড়ল, সেটি তার অকাট্য প্রমাণ। আরেকটি প্রমাণ হলো চীন ও ভারতের বাণিজ্য বৃদ্ধি পাওয়া। এর মধ্যে বেশি উল্লেখযোগ্য হলো চীনে ভারতের রপ্তানি বেড়ে যাওয়া। ভারতের বাণিজ্য মন্ত্রণালয়ের তথ্যানুসারে, চলতি অর্থবছরের এপ্রিল থেকে নভেম্বর পর্যন্ত চীনে ভারতের পণ্য রপ্তানি বেড়েছে ৩৩ শতাংশ, যার আর্থিক মূল্য দাঁড়িয়েছে ১২ দশমিক ২২ বিলিয়ন বা ১ হাজার ২২২ কোটি মার্কিন ডলার। ভারতের বিভিন্ন গণমাধ্যমের খবর, এই প্রবণতার পেছনে আন্তর্জাতিক বাণিজ্যের পরিবর্তিত পরিস্থিতির বিশেষ ভূমিকা আছে। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উচ্চ শুল্কের কারণে সেখানে প্রতিযোগিতামূলক দামে পণ্য পাঠানো ক্রমে কঠিন হয়ে পড়ছে। ফলে ভারতীয় শিল্পমালিক ও রপ্তানিকারকেরা বিকল্প বাজারের সন্ধানে জোর চেষ্টা চালাচ্ছেন। চীনের সঙ্গে রাজনৈতিক বিরোধ সত্ত্বেও রপ্তানির ক্ষেত্রে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ গন্তব্য হয়ে উঠেছে দেশটি। কৌশলগত ও বাস্তব পরিস্থিতির কারণে চীনের বাজারে ভারতের রপ্তানি ভবিষ্যতে আরও বাড়তে পারে। রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর পশ্চিমারা মস্কোর ওপর যেসব নিষেধাজ্ঞা দিয়েছে, পশ্চিমা পৃথিবীর বাইরে তার প্রভাব তেমন একটা নেই। ব্যবসা-বাণিজ্যের গতি রোখার চেষ্টায় ফল হয় না; বরং তা ভিন্ন খাতে প্রবাহিত হয়। দুবাইয়ের এক বাণিজ্য সংস্থার প্রধান এ কথা বলেন। দুবাই মাল্টি কমোডিটিস সেন্টারের (ডিএমসিসি) চেয়ারম্যান হামাদ বুয়ামিম ফাইন্যান্সিয়াল টাইমসকে দেওয়া এক সাক্ষাৎকারে বলেন, নিষেধাজ্ঞা অর্থনীতির গতি কমিয়ে দিতে পারে তবে কখনোই অর্থনীতিকে রুদ্ধ করতে পারে না। ...বাণিজ্যের প্রবাহ ঠিকই থাকে, শুধু তার গতি বদলে যায়। রাশিয়ার ওপর পশ্চিমাদের নিষেধাজ্ঞা আরোপে যেসব দেশ লাভবান হয়েছে, তার মধ্যে সংযুক্ত আরব আমিরাত অন্যতম। এমনিতেই রাশিয়ার ধনকুবেরদের প্রিয় জায়গা দুবাই। তার ওপর সুইজারল্যান্ড মার্কিনদের নেতৃত্বে নিষেধাজ্ঞা আরোপের উদ্যোগে যোগ দিলে তেল ব্যবসায়ীরা জেনেভা থেকে আরব আমিরাতে চলে আসেন। ডিএমসিসির চেয়ারম্যানের এ কথা বলার এটিই মূল কারণ। এই ব্যবসাকেন্দ্রের মূল ব্যবসা হলো তেল। প্রায় তিন হাজার তেল কোম্পানি ডিএমসিসিতে তালিকাভুক্ত। দেখা গেছে, রাশিয়া–ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরু হওয়ার পর ২০২২ সালে রুশ অর্থনীতি সংকুচিত হলেও ২০২৩ ও ২০২৪ সালে উল্লেখযোগ্য প্রবৃদ্ধি অর্জন করেছে। ২০২৩ সালে রাশিয়ার জিডিপি প্রবৃদ্ধি ছিল প্রায় ৩ দশমিক ৬ শতাংশ। ২০২৪ সালে এই প্রবৃদ্ধি আরও বেড়ে প্রায় ৪ দশমিক ১ শতাংশ হয়েছে। যুদ্ধের সময় সামরিক ব্যয় বেড়ে যাওয়া তার একটি কারণ। তবে সামগ্রিকভাবে রুশ নাগরিকেরা খারাপ আছে, এমন কোনো বিশ্বাসযোগ্য খবর পশ্চিমা গণমাধ্যম দিতে পারেনি। রাশিয়ার প্রেসিডেন্ট ভ্লাদিমির পুতিন ডিসেম্বর মাসে দুই দিনের সফরে ভারতে এসেছিলেন। ভূরাজনীতির পাশাপাশি এই সফর অর্থনৈতিকভাবেও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। বিশেষ করে যখন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সঙ্গে ভারতের বাণিজ্যিক বিরোধ তুঙ্গে, সেই সময় ভারতের পরীক্ষিত মিত্র রাশিয়া তার পাশে কতটা দাঁড়াতে পারে, বিশ্লেষকেরা তা দেখার অপেক্ষায় আছেন। এদিকে ভারতের পণ্যে ৫০ শতাংশ শুল্ক আরোপ করেছেন ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প। এতে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে ভারতের রপ্তানি কমছে। যদিও অনেকে মনে করেন, ভারতের পক্ষে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের বাজার হারানো সম্ভব নয়। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে ভারতের রপ্তানি যেখানে বছরে প্রায় ৮০ বিলিয়ন বা ৮ হাজার কোটি ডলার, সেখানে রাশিয়ায় তার রপ্তানি মাত্র ৪ দশমিক ৮৮ বিলিয়ন বা ৪৮৮ কোটি ডলার। তবে রাশিয়ার সঙ্গে বাণিজ্য বৃদ্ধির সর্বাত্মক চেষ্টা করছে ভারত। ২০৩০ সালের মধ্যে রাশিয়ার সঙ্গে দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্যের পরিমাণ ১০০ বিলিয়ন বা ১০ হাজার কোটি ডলারে উন্নীত করতে চায় তারা। এ বিষয়ে রাশিয়াও একমত। রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধের প্রতিক্রিয়ায় রাশিয়া-চীনের সম্পর্ক ঘনিষ্ঠ হয়েছে। বেড়েছে দুই দেশের মধ্যকার দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্য ও সহযোগিতা। এখন ভারত ও চীনের সম্পর্ক ঘনিষ্ঠ হওয়ার বাস্তবতা তৈরি হয়েছে। তার বাস্তবায়ন অনেকটা দেখা যাবে বলেও ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। সেই সঙ্গে এশিয়ার দেশগুলো এখন উঠে আসছে। ব্রিকস শক্তিশালী হচ্ছে। বৈশ্বিক জিডিপির ৩০ শতাংশের বেশি জোগান দিচ্ছে তারা। ভারত ও চীনে ২৮০ কোটির ওপরে মানুষের বসবাস। যেখানে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের জনসংখ্যা ৩৩ কোটি। চীন ও ভারতের অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধি হচ্ছে দ্রুত, প্রযুক্তিতেও তারা শীর্ষ পর্যায়ে। বিশ্বমানের বিজ্ঞানী, মহাকাশ কর্মসূচি, কৃত্রিম বুদ্ধিমত্তা ও ডিজিটাল অর্থনীতিতে অগ্রগতি—সব মিলিয়ে তাদের সম্পর্ক প্রকৃত অর্থে বহুমেরুকেন্দ্রিক ও বহুপক্ষীয় বিশ্বব্যবস্থা গড়তে অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। ফলে এমন সময় হয়তো আসবে, যখন যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের নিষেধাজ্ঞার প্রভাব সেই অর্থে অনুভূত হবে না।",

        "body": "দেশের চলমান অর্থনৈতিক সংকটের মধ্যেও ৮৯ কোটি টাকার জমি বিক্রি করেছে আবাসন খাতের শীর্ষ পর্যায়ের কোম্পানি ইস্টার্ন হাউজিং। গত বছরের জুলাই থেকে ডিসেম্বরে এ জমি বিক্রি করেছে কোম্পানিটি। আগের বছর, অর্থাৎ ২০২১ সালের জুলাই থেকে ডিসেম্বর পর্যন্ত কোম্পানিটি ৭৪ কোটি টাকার জমি বিক্রি করেছিল। সেই হিসাবে, এক বছরের ব্যবধানে কোম্পানিটির জমি বিক্রি বাবদ আয় ১৫ কোটি টাকা বা ২০ শতাংশের বেশি বেড়েছে। শেয়ারবাজারে তালিকাভুক্ত কোম্পানি হিসেবে ইস্টার্ন হাউজিং আজ মঙ্গলবার অর্ধবার্ষিক আর্থিক প্রতিবেদন প্রকাশ করেছে। দেশের প্রধান শেয়ারবাজার ঢাকা স্টক এক্সচেঞ্জের (ডিএসই) ওয়েবসাইটের মাধ্যমে আর্থিক প্রতিবেদনের তথ্য বিনিয়োগকারীদের জানিয়েছে কোম্পানিটি। ওই আর্থিক প্রতিবেদন পর্যালোচনা করে আবাসন খাতে দেশের শীর্ষ স্থানীয় এ প্রতিষ্ঠানের ব্যবসার এ তথ্য জানা গেছে। জমি বিক্রি থেকে আয় বৃদ্ধির পাশাপাশি ব্যাংকে মেয়াদি আমানত রেখেও বড় অঙ্কের সুদ আয় করেছে কোম্পানিটি। এতে অর্ধবার্ষিক শেষে কোম্পানিটি ২৯ কোটি টাকা মুনাফা করেছে, যা আগের বছরের একই সময়ের চেয়ে প্রায় সাড়ে ৪ কোটি টাকা বা সাড়ে ১৮ শতাংশ বেশি। মুনাফা বেড়ে যাওয়ায় শেয়ারপ্রতি আয় বা ইপিএসও বেড়েছে কোম্পানিটির। গত জুলাই-ডিসেম্বর শেষে কোম্পানিটির ইপিএস দাঁড়িয়েছে ৩ টাকা ১৩ পয়সা। ২০২১ সালের একই সময়ে ইপিএস ছিল ২ টাকা ৬৪ পয়সা। এদিকে মুনাফা ও ইপিএস বেড়ে যাওয়ায় আজ মঙ্গলবার শেয়ারবাজারে কোম্পানিটির শেয়ারের দামও বেড়েছে লাফিয়ে। ঢাকার বাজারে আজ একলাফে কোম্পানিটির শেয়ারের দাম সর্বোচ্চ ১০ শতাংশ বা ৮ টাকা ৩০ পয়সা বেড়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে ৯১ টাকা ৫০ পয়সায়। এতে কোম্পানিটি আজ ডিএসইতে মূল্যবৃদ্ধির শীর্ষে ছিল। ইস্টার্ন হাউজিংয়ের আর্থিক প্রতিবেদন থেকে জানা যায়, ২০২২ সালের শেষ ছয় মাসে (জুলাই-ডিসেম্বর) ১০১ কোটি টাকার ব্যবসা করেছে কোম্পানিটি। এর মধ্যে জমি বিক্রি করেছে ৮৯ কোটি টাকার। আর ফ্ল্যাট বিক্রি করেছে ১২ কোটি টাকার। এর বাইরে কোম্পানিটি এ সময়ে দেশের ৯ ব্যাংকে ৪৬৬ কোটি টাকা মেয়াদি আমানত (এফডিআর) রেখে প্রায় ১২ কোটি টাকা সুদ আয় করেছে। আগের বছরের একই সময়ে সুদ আয় ছিল ৫ কোটি টাকা। সেই হিসাবে দেখা যাচ্ছে, ইস্টার্ন হাউজিং গত বছরের ছয় মাসে সুদ বাবদ আগের বছরের চেয়ে দ্বিগুণের বেশি আয় করেছে। কোম্পানিটির শীর্ষস্থানীয় এক কর্মকর্তা নাম প্রকাশ না করার শর্তে প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, অর্থনৈতিক পরিস্থিতি বিবেচনায় গত বছরের উল্লিখিত সময়ে কোম্পানিটি নতুন প্রকল্পে খুব বেশি বিনিয়োগ করেনি। এ কারণে হাতে অনেক নগদ অর্থ ছিল। সেই টাকা ব্যাংকে রেখে ভালো আয় করেছে। আবাসন খাতসংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যক্তিরা জানান, সাধারণত যেকোনো অর্থনৈতিক সংকটে জমি বা ফ্ল্যাট কেনার প্রতি মানুষের আগ্রহ বেড়ে যায়। নিরাপদ বিনিয়োগ হিসেবে মানুষ এসব খাতে বিনিয়োগ করে। তার প্রমাণও মিলেছে ইস্টার্ন হাউজিংয়ের ব্যবসার ক্ষেত্রে। গত বছরের ফেব্রুয়ারিতে রাশিয়া-ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ শুরুর পর দেশেও অর্থনৈতিক সংকট দেখা দেয়। এ সময় সব ধরনের জিনিসপত্রের দাম অনেক বেড়ে যায়। ডলার–সংকট দেখা দেয় ব্যাংক খাতে। এর মধ্যেও জমিতে বিনিয়োগ বেড়েছে মানুষের। এ কারণে ইস্টার্ন হাউজিংয়ের জমি বিক্রি আগের বছরের চেয়ে ২০ শতাংশের বেশি বেড়েছে।",

        "body": "ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের সঙ্গে একটি মাইলফলক বাণিজ্যিক চুক্তি চূড়ান্ত করার ঘোষণা দিয়েছেন ভারতের প্রধানমন্ত্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদি। গতকাল দিল্লিতে ভারত-ইইউ সম্মেলনের আগে তিনি এ চুক্তির গুরুত্ব তুলে ধরে বলেন, এটি ভারত ও ইউরোপের কোটি কোটি মানুষের জন্য বিশাল সুযোগ বয়ে আনবে। দুই দশক ধরে দীর্ঘ আলোচনার পর এ বহুল আকাঙ্ক্ষিত বাণিজ্য চুক্তিটি (এফটিএ) বিশ্বের সবচেয়ে জনবহুল দেশ ভারতকে তার বিশাল ও সুরক্ষিত বাজারসহ বৃহত্তম বাণিজ্য অংশীদার ২৭ জাতির ইইউয়ের সঙ্গে মুক্ত বাণিজ্যের পথ প্রশস্ত করার সুযোগ দেবে। এ বিষয়ে নরেন্দ্র মোদি বলেন, সোমবার ভারত ও ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের মধ্যে একটি বড় চুক্তি স্বাক্ষরিত হয়েছে। বিশ্বের মানুষ একে ‘মাদার অফ অল ডিলস’ বলে অভিহিত করছে। -রয়টার্স এ চুক্তি ভারতের ১৪০ কোটি এবং ইউরোপের কোটি কোটি মানুষের জন্য বড় সুযোগ তৈরি করবে। রয়টার্স জানায়, গতকাল বিকালে মোদি এবং ইউরোপীয় কমিশনের প্রেসিডেন্ট উরসুলা ফন ডার লিয়েন নয়া দিল্লিতে ভারত-ইইউ সম্মেলনে যৌথভাবে এ চুক্তির আনুষ্ঠানিক ঘোষণা দেন এবং বিস্তারিত তথ্য প্রকাশ করেন বলে ধারণা করা হচ্ছে। ২০২৫ সালের মার্চ পর্যন্ত অর্থবছরের বাণিজ্য প্রেক্ষাপট ও পরিসংখ্যান অনুযায়ী, ভারত ও ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের মধ্যে দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্যের পরিমাণ ছিল ১৩ হাজার ৬৫০ কোটি ডলার। এ বিশাল অঙ্কের বাণিজ্যকে আরও গতিশীল ও বিস্তৃত করতেই নতুন এ চুক্তি করা হয়েছে। সাম্প্রতিক সময়ে ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়ন মারকোসুর, ইন্দোনেশিয়া, মেক্সিকো ও সুইজারল্যান্ডের সঙ্গে বড় ধরনের চুক্তি করেছে। অন্যদিকে ভারতও ব্রিটেন, নিউজিল্যান্ড ও ওমানের সঙ্গে বাণিজ্যিক সম্পর্ক জোরদার করেছে। বিশ্লেষকদের মতে, মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্পের রক্ষণশীল বাণিজ্য নীতি এবং গ্রিনল্যান্ড ইস্যুতে ইউরোপীয় মিত্রদের ওপর শুল্ক আরোপের হুমকির মুখে দেশগুলো এখন বিকল্প বাজার খুঁজছে। বিশেষ করে ভারতের পণ্যের ওপর ট্রাম্প ৫০ শতাংশ শুল্ক আরোপ করার পর গত বছর ভারত-যুক্তরাষ্ট্র বাণিজ্য চুক্তি ভেস্তে যায়। মূলত ওয়াশিংটনের ওপর নির্ভরতা কমিয়ে নিজেদের অর্থনীতি সুরক্ষিত রাখতেই ভারত ও ইইউ এ চুক্তিতে উপনীত হয়েছে। ভারত সরকারের একজন ঊর্ধ্বতন কর্মকর্তা জানিয়েছেন, চুক্তির আইনি দিকগুলোর যাচাইবাছাই শেষ করতে আরও পাঁচ থেকে ছয় মাস সময় লাগতে পারে। তিনি বলেন, আমরা আশা করছি আগামী এক বছরের মধ্যেই এ চুক্তি পূর্ণাঙ্গভাবে কার্যকর হবে। -রয়টার্স",
