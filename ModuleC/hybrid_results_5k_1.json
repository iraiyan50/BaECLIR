        "title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise",
        "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

        "title": "Rights to education and health",
        "body": "Globally, it is recognised that ‘educating children’ gives the next generation the most effective tools to fight poverty, prevent diseases, build resilience and create a progressive and peaceful society as ‘good health and well-being for all’ is the foundation of sustainable development. So, to protect and promote the universal rights to education and health are requisites for all aspects of social and economic development. Two articles, 17 and 28, of the constitution entrench universal rights to education, especially free primary education, as well as rights to freedom of choice to get the higher education keeping to everyone’s potential and merit. Article 18 (1) highlights the state’s primary duty to raise the nutrition level and to improve the public health. So, the constitutional mandate and the given commitment to the several international conventions such as United Nations’ Convention on Child Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights oblige obligate Bangladesh to ensure free access to quality education and improved health services. Despite being the basic human right, the constitution does not recognise the health right as the universal human rights. The global development framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, commits to leaving no one behind, which is a great premise to working together with international development partners to provide quality education and health services for all. What is the ground reality in both sectors: education and health? National statistics show that 40.72 per cent of children and youths are out of education because of multifaceted causes as well as the maternal and under-five child mortality rates are 163 per 100,000 live births (maternal mortality) and 30.6 deaths under 1000 live births (under-five mortality) respectively. This clearly indicates the state could not protect the education and health rights as the universal human rights. In addition, 51.4 per cent of girl children are married off they reach 18 and 11.3 per cent of children are engaged in labour. This is also a gross violation of children’s rights to development with their full potential. The disparities between rural and urban education and health services in terms of access to and the quality of services are unimaginable. The people in several poverty pockets such as delta, coastal and haor areas do not have minimum level of access to health care services and to quality education. There are union health complexes and government primary schools, but they are almost completely dysfunctional for lack of resources, isolation, negligence of the national and local government authorities, overlooking and exclusionary approach and the frame of mind of the political and community leaders, prevailing rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability and people’s ignorance and lack of voice for their rights and entitlement. However, only in some big cities, particularly in the capital city, a very few education and health facilities and institutions provide acceptable standards of health and education services. But that are expensive and completely out of reach of ordinary people. Only the affluent group of people, about 10 per cent of the population, can afford this good quality of health and education services. And, almost 90 per cent of the population and all of rural and marginalised people, who are penniless and powerless, receive education and health services from the dysfunctional and retrospective facilities and systems. As a result, not only individuals face the adverse impact of the dysfunctional health and education services, but also national development also suffers in all aspects. The health and education services have completely been turned into business through the hegemonic political systems and monopoly and manipulative business approaches. Good quality of education and health service systems are the main engines of all kinds of development, economic and social. But keeping the majority portion of the population out of the quality services, a country cannot get on the development highway. Research shows that one dollar’s investment in education and health sectors generates more than one dollar’s return; but in all other sectors, it creates less than one dollar’s return. It proves that the rates of returns on investment in education and health sectors are much higher than that of another sectors. The good quality of education and health services is also the most effective tools to achieve the sustainable development, including poverty alleviation and building resilience of individual, community and systems to climate change, natural and artificial shocks and disasters. Definitely, the constraint of resources — financial and expertise — is a challenge to provide good quality of education and health services as the national budget allocation is much less than what is required. Along with this limited resource allocation, rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability, political engagement of professionals, monopoly business approaches, denial of human rights and the lack of the rule of law destroy the education and health systems. A comprehensive, rights-based-approach is required to enable both parties, service recipients and providers, as rights holders and legal and moral duty bearers respectively so that they can effectively perform their duties in all kinds of businesses and services. The marginalised and excluded section of the population as rights holders need to be able enough to receive technical and non-technical supports to claim their rights and entitlement accordingly. A rights-based approach is complementary with humanitarian and democratic norms, the rule of law, transparency and accountability and it impacts well-being, progress and prosperity. It is imperative to create such an inclusive, integrated and rights-based business environment and platforms that help to attain the expected outcomes, promoting ethical business standards with humanity and prohibiting unethical and illegal business that only makes money. So, improvement in the quality of education and health services requires some important policy and strategic actions. Demonstrating strategic, visionary and people-centric leadership would dismantle the hegemonic myths, bringing all actors together to the playground with the highest standard of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Business syndicates of rights-based services systems over the monopoly and manipulative business systems in education and health sectors should be eliminated. Primary and essential health care and services must be free for all people and specialised health services must be affordable for the rural poor and marginalised people with an equitable access to good public health. Physicians must stay in community and union health complexes and provide specialised health services for rural people. Public and private partnership should be attempted at to address the challenges of resources constraints. The marginalised and excluded groups should be empowered to protect their rights to quality services. The government implements social safety net programmes to support the extreme poor and people with disabilities, but that is not effective because of political bias, corruption, abuse, exploitation and exclusion. Rights-based, service-oriented education and health systems should be established. It is essential to raise the floors of the extreme poor and marginalised people with education and empowerment programmes and initiatives so that they can raise their voice for their rights and entitlement. It is imperative that Bangladesh now should implement a comprehensive reform initiative, but no reforms will sustain in the long run if the reforms do not focus on education and health systems.

        "body": "Education Minister Dr. Osman Farruk yesterday said Monthly Pay Order (MPO) and government grants to educational institutions must not be a \"permanent settlement\". \"The educational institutions that will fail to register a minimum performance should not have the right to claim government grants and facilities,\" he said while inaugurating as chief guest the national-level programme of the 'National Education Week-2003'. Held at the Osmani Memorial Hall under the auspices of the education ministry, the function was also addressed by State Minister for Education ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Deputy Minister Mohammad Abdus Salam Pinto as special guests. Presided over by Education Secretary Mohammad Shahidul Alam, the inaugural function was also addressed, among others, by Director General of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Directorate Abdur Rashid and Joint Secretary of the ministry Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. Dr. Osman Farruk said the education administration had become weak and full of irregularities and the managing committees almost \"non-functioning\" because of \"personal\" and \"coterie\" interests. \"Our government does not believe in politicisation of school and college managing committees,\" he said adding that to improve the prevailing situation, both responsibility and accountability of the governing bodies had to be enhanced. The education minister said the responsibility to improve the standard of education must be carried out jointly by its stakeholders -- teachers, students, guardians, civil society members and the government. The education minister said the curriculum as well as syllabus of the text books must be \"life-oriented\" and realistic so that real nation-building architects come out from the country's 107,000 educational institutions. The main work to attain this goal has to be carried out by 750,000 teachers employed in these institutions, he said. Turning to the quality education, the minister said \"We do not want to engage police to remove note books from the market, nor do we want to close down the private coaching centres right now.\" \"We have to go to the root of the problem and ask ourselves why students have become dependent on note books and coaching centres,\" he said, adding that teachers must perform their sacred jobs of imparting education and wisdom to their pupils in the class room for the full period of their contract hours before heading for coaching centres. \"We have to recast our education system so that the new generation can be injected with human and moral values and are well-educated,\" he said. He stressed the need for introducing an education system that is capable of achieving the basic objectives of education, like enlightening the learners, making them wise, knowledgeable and good citizens and capable of innovating new skills and strategies for nation-building purposes. Making a departure from his written speech, the education minister raised some important issues like adopting unfair means in examinations, misuse of funds and facilities, sufferings of the teachers in the corridors of education directorate and national university to get their problems addressed. At the same time, the minister hinted at some important measures his ministry is going to take to streamline this very important sector of national life. He said the education directorate and the national university would be further decentralised so that the teachers and others concerned could get their services without undergoing much hazard and inconvenience. The inaugural session was followed by National Education Conference entitled \"Education for Attaining Self-reliance\".",

        "title": "How digital communication is redefining school-parent communication",
        "body": "Two parties play the most instrumental role in a child’s learning journey at school: the parents and the school authorities, particularly the teachers. Establishing a clear and consistent line of communication between these two is crucial to ensuring a child’s academic progress and overall development.\n\nFor decades, communication largely relied on paperwork: report cards, homework sheets, and various notices that students carried home in their backpacks. But this system was prone to gaps. Important messages, like teacher feedback or test dates, were often missed, leaving parents confused or uninformed about key developments.\n\nToday, with digital transformation sweeping through every sector, education is no exception. Communication between teachers and parents is rapidly shifting from traditional methods, handwritten notes, phone calls, and in-person meetings, to more streamlined, digital platforms that cater to the pace and needs of modern families.\n\nThis shift not only facilitates faster communication but also helps build stronger partnerships between home and school.\n\nMore and more parents now prefer digital updates over physical meetings, reflecting a change in expectations from schools. This is a positive trend: as studies suggest, informed parents are better positioned to support their children’s growth. According to educational psychologists, when parents stay engaged and monitor their child’s progress regularly, it leads to stronger academic outcomes and emotional well-being.\n\nIn light of this, many progressive schools are embracing digital platforms for parent communication. One such initiative is being implemented at Glenrich International School, where we have recently launched a dedicated parent communication app. This platform offers parents real-time access to their child’s academic updates, class schedules, and feedback—all in one place, without needing to call or visit the school.\n\nThe advantages of such tools are multifaceted. Parents receive instant notifications about attendance, academic performance, behavior, and upcoming school events. Teachers can share photos, videos, and summaries of classroom activities, giving parents a window into their child’s learning day. Real-time messaging allows urgent information, like schedule changes or emergencies, to be shared without delay, ensuring that parents can respond immediately when needed.\n\nMoreover, these digital tools foster a collaborative environment. Two-way communication, through instant messaging, direct feedback, or group announcements, builds trust and transparency. This helps create a strong sense of community between educators and families, all united in supporting the student’s success.\n\nResearch from Southeast Missouri State University has found that digital communication tools enhance student learning by encouraging collaboration, quick access to information, and personalized support. Increased parental involvement, enabled by these platforms, directly correlates with improved learning outcomes.\n\nWhen digital tools are proving effective in improving communication, engagement, and student performance, it’s worth asking: Why hold on to outdated methods? It’s time for all schools to reconsider their approach and embrace the digital shift that supports every child’s growth journey.\n\nAnit Arora is theprincipal of Glenrich International School, Satarkul.",

        "body": "Bangladesh is set to introduce its first national emergency alert system—Missing Urgent Notification (MUN Alert)—to speed up the rescue of missing and abducted children.\n\nAlongside this initiative, a 24/7 toll-free helpline—13219—is being officially introduced to receive information related to missing children across the country.\n\nCID Chief Additional Inspector General Sibgat Ullah made the disclosure at a press briefing in its headquarters on Tuesday.\n\nThe MUN Alert system has been developed under the leadership of the Missing Children Cell of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Bangladesh Police, with technical and coordination support from the Zero Missing Children Platform and international collaboration from the Amber Alert for Bangladesh team.\n\nThe initiative draws inspiration from the globally recognized AMBER Alert system, first launched in the United States following the 1996 abduction and murder of child Amber Hagerman.\n\nSimilar systems are now in place across Europe and in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, China, Nigeria, Kenya and Pakistan.\n\nInternational research shows that the first few hours after a child goes missing are critical, and timely, verified alerts significantly increase the chances of safe recovery.\n\nIn the context of Bangladesh, tragic incidents—including the disappearance and murder of five-year-old Muntaha Akhter in Sylhet in 2024—have underscored the urgent need for a fast, integrated and technology-driven response mechanism.\n\nUnder the MUN Alert system, when there is reasonable suspicion that a child is missing or abducted, the CID will issue an emergency alert based on verified information.\n\nThe alert may be disseminated through an official web portal and mobile app, online and offline media, social media platforms, digital billboards, mobile SMS or cell broadcasting, and other technology-based channels to ensure widespread public awareness and participation.\n\nAuthorities emphasized that the dignity, safety and privacy of the child will remain paramount throughout the process.\n\nMembers of the public can report information about missing children through the national emergency service 999, the Missing Children Cell hotline (01320017060), or the newly launched toll-free helpline 13219.\n\nThe authority to verify information, assess risk levels, and issue, suspend or withdraw alerts will rest solely with the Missing Children Cell of the CID.\n\nWhere necessary, Yellow Notices may be issued through INTERPOL in cases involving risks of cross-border movement or child trafficking.\n\nThe initiative is being implemented in collaboration with the National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)—the organization that manages the global Amber Alert system—and Meta (Facebook), working closely with the CID and the Zero Missing Children Platform.\n\nStakeholders expressed strong optimism that the launch of MUN Alert will establish a state-led, technology-based and integrated national framework for rescuing missing children, significantly strengthening child protection and access to justice in Bangladesh.",

        "title": "মাদ্রাসায় চালু হচ্ছে ‘ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা’, অনুমোদন পেতে শর্ত প্রযোজ্য",
        "body": "বাংলাদেশের মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় প্রথমবারের মতো দাখিল (এসএসসি সমমান) স্তরে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু হতে যাচ্ছে। আগামী শিক্ষাবর্ষ থেকেই দেশব্যাপী নির্দিষ্ট শর্তসাপেক্ষে মাদ্রাসাগুলোতে এই বিভাগ চালুর অনুমোদন দেবে বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ড। এরই মধ্যে নতুন কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপি চূড়ান্তকরণের কাজ চলছে। নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত অনুযায়ী, ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষেই ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর জন্য শতাধিক মাদ্রাসা আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ শিক্ষাবর্ষের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টির বেশি আবেদন। জানা গেছে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর উদ্যোগ এটি প্রথম নয়। এর আগে গত এক দশকে দুই দফায় এই প্রচেষ্টা নেওয়া হলেও তা বাস্তবে রূপ পায়নি। কর্মকর্তা ও নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, সরকারের অনীহা, প্রশাসনিক জটিলতা এবং নীতিগত অসহযোগিতার কারণে তৎকালীন সময়ে উদ্যোগটি থেমে যায়। বোর্ড সূত্রে জানা যায়, ২০১৪ সালের দিকে প্রথমবার ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর নীতিগত আলোচনা শুরু হয়। কিন্তু সে সময় শিক্ষানীতি বাস্তবায়ন নিয়ে অস্পষ্টতা, বাজেট সংকট এবং রাজনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তার কারণে বিষয়টি এগোয়নি। পরবর্তীতে ২০১৮ সালে দ্বিতীয়বার এই প্রস্তাব তোলা হলে পরিবর্তনশীল সরকারি অগ্রাধিকার এবং প্রশাসনিক সাড়া না পাওয়ায় উদ্যোগটি আবারও বন্ধ হয়ে যায়। নীতিনির্ধারকদের মতে, তখন মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাকে মূলধারায় আনার কথা বলা হলেও কার্যকর পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া হয়নি। শিক্ষক নিয়োগ, পাঠ্যপুস্তক তৈরি, কারিকুলাম অনুমোদন— প্রতিটি ধাপেই নানা প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক বাধা প্রকল্পটিকে স্থবির করে তোলে। তবে, বর্তমান পরিস্থিতি ভিন্ন বলে মনে করছেন সংশ্লিষ্ট কর্মকর্তারা। নতুন শিক্ষা কাঠামো, দক্ষতাভিত্তিক শিক্ষার ওপর জোর এবং মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় কর্মমুখী বিষয় যুক্ত করার সরকারি আগ্রহের কারণে এবার উদ্যোগটি সফল হওয়ার সম্ভাবনা অনেক বেশি। তাদের মতে, এখন রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছা ও প্রশাসনিক সহযোগিতা থাকায় বাস্তবায়ন অগ্রগতিও দ্রুত হয়েছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের চেয়ারম্যান মিঞা মো. নূরুল হক ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিষয় চালুর নীতিগত সিদ্ধান্ত বাস্তবায়নে আন্তরিকভাবে চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। তবে, শুরুতে সব মাদ্রাসায় এর অনুমোদন মিলবে না। সেজন্য তিনটি শর্ত অবশ্যই পূরণ করতে হবে- প্রথমত, সংশ্লিষ্ট মাদ্রাসায় চলতি বছরে অষ্টম শ্রেণিতে ন্যূনতম ১০০ শিক্ষার্থী থাকতে হবে। দ্বিতীয়ত, পর্যাপ্ত ভৌত অবকাঠামো থাকতে হবে, যাতে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগের জন্য অন্তত দুটি অতিরিক্ত শ্রেণিকক্ষ চালু করলেও অন্যান্য ক্লাস ব্যাহত না হয়। তৃতীয়ত, এনটিআরসিএর মাধ্যমে শিক্ষক নিয়োগ না আসা পর্যন্ত মাদ্রাসার নিজস্ব তহবিল থেকে খণ্ডকালীন ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শিক্ষক নিয়োগ দেওয়ার সক্ষমতা থাকতে হবে। চেয়ারম্যান বলেন, ‘এই তিনটি মাপকাঠি (ক্রাইটেরিয়া) যাদের আছে এবং যারা আগ্রহী, কেবল তারাই আবেদন করতে পারবেন। বাস্তবতা দেখে পরবর্তীতে শর্ত শিথিল করার বিষয়টি বিবেচনা করা হবে।’ বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার দপ্তর বলছে, এরইমধ্যে ২০২৬ শিক্ষাবর্ষে ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ খোলার জন্য শতাধিক প্রতিষ্ঠান আবেদন করেছে। আর ২০২৭ সালের জন্য জমা পড়েছে আরও প্রায় ৮০টি মাদ্রাসার আবেদন। বাংলাদেশ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের রেজিস্ট্রার অধ্যাপক ছালেহ আহমাদ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘বর্তমানে যুগের চাহিদার সঙ্গে সামঞ্জস্য রেখে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রতি ব্যাপক আগ্রহ দেখা যাচ্ছে। আমরা চাই সংখ্যার চেয়ে মানের ওপর বেশি গুরুত্ব দিতে, যাতে শিক্ষার্থীরা ভবিষ্যতে জাতীয় অর্থনীতিতে দক্ষ মানবসম্পদ হিসেবে অবদান রাখতে পারে।’ তিনি বলেন, এসব আবেদন প্রাথমিকভাবে বাছাই করা হচ্ছে। সরেজমিন পরিদর্শনের মাধ্যমে প্রত্যেকটি প্রতিষ্ঠানের অবকাঠামো, শিক্ষক সংকট, শ্রেণিকক্ষ, ল্যাব সুবিধা এবং প্রশাসনিক সক্ষমতা যাচাই করা হবে। নীতিমালা অনুযায়ী শর্ত পূরণ হলেই কেবল পর্যায়ক্রমে অনুমোদন দেওয়া হবে। এজন্য বোর্ড সর্বোচ্চ স্বচ্ছতা, জবাবদিহি ও মাননিয়ন্ত্রণ নিশ্চিত করেই অনুমোদনের প্রক্রিয়া সম্পন্ন করবে বলেও মন্তব্য করেন তিনি। অন্যদিকে বোর্ড কর্মকর্তারা বলছেন, যুগোপযোগী শিক্ষার বিস্তারে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করা অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। কারণ দেশে ব্যাংকিং, হিসাবরক্ষণ, ব্যবসায় ব্যবস্থাপনা, উদ্যোক্তা উন্নয়ন ও ইসলামী অর্থনীতি— এসব ক্ষেত্রে দক্ষ জনশক্তির চাহিদা বাড়ছে। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীরা এত দিন এই মূলধারার সুযোগ থেকে বেশিরভাগই বঞ্চিত ছিল। মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বোর্ডের কারিকুলাম বিশেষজ্ঞ ড. মোহাম্মদ হেদায়েত উল্লাহ ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘আলিয়া মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা শাখা চালুর জন্য কারিকুলাম ও পাণ্ডুলিপির চূড়ান্তকরণ এখন শেষ পর্যায়ে। নতুন বইগুলোর প্রায় ৯৫ শতাংশ সাধারণ স্কুল–কলেজের ব্যবসায় শিক্ষার বইয়ের মতোই হবে। তবে ইসলামী অর্থনীতি, সুদের ধারণা, নৈতিক ব্যবসা পরিচালনা ও শরিয়াহভিত্তিক বাণিজ্যব্যবস্থা— এসব অতিরিক্ত বিষয় যুক্ত করা হয়েছে।’ তিনি আরও বলেন, ‘ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর প্রক্রিয়াটি দীর্ঘদিন ধরেই চলমান। আগেও দুবার চেষ্টা করা হয়েছিল, কিন্তু নীতিগত ও কাঠামোগত নানা কারণে তা বাস্তবায়িত হয়নি। এবার সরকার পরিবর্তনের পর নতুন করে নীতিগত অগ্রাধিকারে এই উদ্যোগ দ্রুত এগোচ্ছে। মাদ্রাসার শিক্ষার্থীরা এর ফলে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক দক্ষতার পথে বড় সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘বছরের শুরুতেই নতুন বিভাগে পাঠদান শুরু করার প্রস্তুতি নেওয়া হচ্ছে। প্রয়োজন হলে ফেব্রুয়ারি পর্যন্ত অতিরিক্ত সময় নিয়ে বই পৌঁছানো হবে। তবে, পরবর্তী শিক্ষাবর্ষে পাঠ্যবইগুলো আরও আধুনিকায়ন করা হবে’— বলেন ড. হেদায়েতুল্লাহ। অন্যদিকে, মাদ্রাসায় ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালু করতে সরকারের এমন সিদ্ধান্তকে বড় পরিবর্তনের উদ্যোগ হিসেবে দেখছেন মাদ্রাসাপ্রধানরা। তারা বলছেন, বর্তমান চাহিদা অনুযায়ী এমন সিদ্ধান্ত সময়োপযোগী ও যুগান্তকারী। দীর্ঘদিন ধরে মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার্থীদের জন্য কর্মমুখী শিক্ষার সুযোগ সৃষ্টির দাবি ছিল। ব্যবসায় শিক্ষা বিভাগ চালুর ফলে এখন আমাদের শিক্ষার্থীরা বিজ্ঞান ও মানবিক শাখার পাশাপাশি আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞান লাভ করে দেশের অর্থনীতিতে সরাসরি অবদান রাখতে পারবে। এই উদ্যোগ মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষার প্রতি সাধারণ মানুষের আগ্রহ আরও বাড়িয়ে তুলবে। ময়মনসিংহের কাতলাসেন কাদেরিয়া কামিল মাদ্রাসার অধ্যক্ষ দেলোয়ার হোসেন আজিজী ঢাকা পোস্টকে বলেন, ‘এটি আমাদের জন্য একটি বিশাল সুযোগ। এত দিন মাদ্রাসার ছাত্রদের জন্য কর্মসংস্থান ও উচ্চশিক্ষার ক্ষেত্র কিছুটা সীমিত ছিল। নতুন এই বিভাগ চালু হওয়ায় শিক্ষার্থীরা এখন ব্যাংক, বীমা, কর্পোরেট হাউজসহ বিভিন্ন ব্যবসায়িক প্রতিষ্ঠানে নিজেদের ক্যারিয়ার গড়ার সুযোগ পাবে।’ ‘আমরা আশা করি, তারা ইসলামী মূল্যবোধ ও নৈতিকতার সঙ্গে আধুনিক ব্যবসায়িক জ্ঞানের সমন্বয় ঘটিয়ে সৎ ও যোগ্য উদ্যোক্তা হিসেবে সমাজে নিজেদের প্রতিষ্ঠিত করতে সক্ষম হবে’— মনে করেন এই অধ্যক্ষ।",

        "body": "সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করতে বা শিক্ষার মানোন্নয়নে শাসকশ্রেণির কোনো ভূমিকা দেখছেন না অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। তিনি বলেন, যাঁরা শাসকশ্রেণির অন্তর্ভুক্ত, তাঁদের সন্তান কিংবা নাতি-নাতনিরা ভালো মানের বেসরকারি ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করেছে, করছে ও করবে। ‘বাংলাদেশে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ: অধিকতর ন্যায়পরায়ণ সমাজের পথরেখা’ শিরোনামে শনিবার রাতে একটি অনুষ্ঠানে বক্তব্য দেন গবেষণা সংস্থা সেন্টার ফর পলিসি ডায়ালগের (সিপিডি) চেয়ারম্যান অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান। রাজধানীর বাংলামোটরে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রে এই অনুষ্ঠানের আয়োজন করে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘ। অনুষ্ঠানে অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা বিভক্ত। এই বিভক্তি দূর করতে না পারলে সামনে শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় আরও সামাজিক সংঘাত অপেক্ষা করছে। শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণের জন্য কয়েকটি প্রস্তাব তুলে ধরেন রেহমান সোবহান। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, পাবলিক এডুকেশন (সরকারিভাবে শিক্ষার ব্যবস্থা) এমন একটা পর্যায়ে নিয়ে যেতে হবে, যেখানে সবার জন্য মানসম্মত শিক্ষা নিশ্চিত করা যায়। এ জন্য শিক্ষা খাতে বরাদ্দ তিন গুণ বাড়াতে হবে। নিম্ন আয়ের পরিবারের সন্তানদের স্বল্প মেয়াদে ভালো শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে আসন বরাদ্দ রাখা ও বৃত্তি দেওয়ার মতো সহযোগিতা সরকারের দিক থেকে থাকতে পারে বলে প্রস্তাবে উল্লেখ করেন তিনি। অধ্যাপক রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, দেশের নেতারা বছরের পর বছর মাতৃভাষায় মানসম্মত শিক্ষার উন্নয়নে ভূমিকা রাখেননি, যা পূর্ব বা দক্ষিণ-পূর্ব এশিয়ার দেশগুলো করেছে। এর বিপরীততে দেশে ইংরেজি মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানকে উৎসাহিত করা হয়েছে। এ প্রসঙ্গে তিনি বলেন, এমনটা করা যেতে পারে, যাঁরা সংসদ সদস্য পদে নির্বাচন করতে চান, তাঁদের সন্তানদের বাধ্যতামূলকভাবে বাংলা মাধ্যমের শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়াশোনা করাতে হবে। সন্তানেরা সরকারি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে পড়লে এর মান বাড়ানোর চেষ্টা করবেন তাঁরা। তবে তিনি বলেন, এমন প্রত্যাশা তাঁর কল্পনা ছাড়া কিছু নয়। রেহমান সোবহান বলেন, শিক্ষায় নিয়ম ও সুশাসন ফিরিয়ে আনতে হবে। আর এটা তখনই সম্ভব হবে, যখন অর্থ বা পেশিশক্তির পরিবর্তে জবাবদিহি, অন্তর্ভুক্তিমূলক ও গণতান্ত্রিক প্রক্রিয়া প্রতিষ্ঠা করা যাবে। দীর্ঘ মেয়াদে শিক্ষার গণতন্ত্রীকরণ করতে হলে রাজনীতিকে গণতান্ত্রিক করতে হবে এবং গণতান্ত্রিক সমাজ লাগবে। গণতান্ত্রিক শিক্ষাব্যবস্থায় যাত্রা দীর্ঘ, কিন্তু এই যাত্রা বাধ্যতামূলক। অন্তর্বর্তী সরকার এখন পর্যন্ত শিক্ষায় যথেষ্ট গুরুত্ব দেয়নি উল্লেখ করে অনুষ্ঠানে বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্রের প্রতিষ্ঠাতা অধ্যাপক আবদুল্লাহ আবু সায়ীদ বলেন, শিক্ষা যে সবচেয়ে আনন্দময়, সবচেয়ে উপকারী এবং সমৃদ্ধির ঘটক—এই কথাটা সমাজের মধ্যে আনা যায়নি। দেশের রাজনীতিবিদদের কখনোই দেখা যায়নি যে তাঁরা চিন্তাশীল মানুষের কথা শোনেন। যে কারণে দেশের জ্ঞানী ব্যক্তিদের পরামর্শ ও উপদেশ রাজনীতির ক্ষেত্রে প্রভাব রাখে না। ডেইলি স্টার সম্পাদক মাহ্ফুজ আনাম বলেন, যার যার জায়গা থেকে খুব ক্ষুদ্র স্তরে হলেও পরিবর্তনের সূচনা করতে হবে। গৃহকর্মীদের ছেলেমেয়েদের পড়াশোনার জন্য অর্থ সহযোগিতা দিয়ে এই পরিবর্তনের অংশ হওয়া যেতে পারে বলে মনে করেন তিনি। অনুষ্ঠানের সঞ্চালক ছিলেন বিশ্বসাহিত্য কেন্দ্র প্রাক্তন সভ্য সংঘের সদস্য সিরাজুল ইসলাম কাদির। আরও বক্তব্য দেন মেটলাইফ বাংলাদেশের প্রধান নির্বাহী কর্মকর্তা আলাউদ্দিন আহমদ। অনুষ্ঠানে আরও উপস্থিত ছিলেন সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো অধ্যাপক রওনক জাহান, অধ্যাপক এম এম আকাশ ও সিপিডির সম্মাননীয় ফেলো মোস্তাফিজুর রহমান।",

        "body": "শিক্ষামন্ত্রী দীপু মনি বলেছেন, সারা দেশে আজ বই উৎসব হয়েছে। সারা পৃথিবীতে বাংলাদেশ অনন্য দৃষ্টান্ত স্থাপন করেছে, যেখানে বছরের প্রথম দিন বই উৎসব হয় এবং কোটি কোটি শিক্ষার্থী এ বই উৎসবে অংশগ্রহণ করে। এ বছর মাধ্যমিকের পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসব অনুষ্ঠিত হয়েছে গাজীপুরের কাপাসিয়া উপজেলার কাপাসিয়া সরকারি পাইলট উচ্চবিদ্যালয়ে। এ অনুষ্ঠানে প্রধান অতিথির বক্তব্যে এসব কথা বলেন শিক্ষামন্ত্রী। আজ রোববার সকাল সাড়ে ১০টায় বেলুন উড়িয়ে উৎসবের উদ্বোধন করেন দীপু মনি। পরে দুপুর সাড়ে ১২টায় বিভিন্ন শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থীর হাতে বিনা মূল্যের নতুন বই তুলে দেন তিনি। অনুষ্ঠানে নতুন শিক্ষাক্রম নিয়ে কথা বলেন শিক্ষামন্ত্রী। তিনি বলেন, ‘এমন একটি শিক্ষাক্রম গঠন করেছি, যেখানে শিক্ষা হবে আনন্দময়। পরীক্ষা নিয়ে শিক্ষার্থীরা ভীত থাকবে না। পরীক্ষা থাকবে। তবে ধারাবাহিক মূল্যায়নের মধ্য দিয়ে অনুশীলন হবে। প্রতিদিন শিক্ষার্থীরা তা করে শিখবে। কোনো মুখস্থবিদ্যার বালাই থাকবে না। সক্রিয় শিখন হবে। অভিজ্ঞতাভিত্তিক শিখন হবে। যা শিখবে তা আবার প্রয়োগ করতে শিখবে। কেমন করে শিখতে হয়, তা–ও শিখে ফেলবে।’ বই বিতরণ নিয়ে একটি পরিসংখ্যান তুলে ধরেন দীপু মনি। তিনি বলেন, ‘২০১০ সাল থেকে ২০২৩ সাল পর্যন্ত সরকার শিক্ষার্থীদের মধ্যে ৪৩৪ কোটি ৪৫ লাখ ৮০ হাজার ২১১টি বই বিনা মূল্যে বিতরণ করেছে। এটি পৃথিবীর যেকোনো জায়গার জন্য অচিন্তনীয় বিষয়। কিন্তু কাজটি বঙ্গবন্ধু–কন্যার নির্দেশনায় আমরা প্রতিবছর করে যাচ্ছি।’ শিক্ষামন্ত্রী আরও বলেন, ‘শেখ হাসিনা আমাদের ডিজিটাল বাংলাদেশ তৈরি করে দিয়েছেন। বাংলাদেশের সরকার হবে স্মার্ট সরকার, অর্থনীতি হবে স্মার্ট অর্থনীতি, সমাজ হবে স্মার্ট সমাজ, এসব গড়ার জন্য দরকার স্মার্ট শিক্ষা। নতুন শিক্ষাক্রম তৈরির মাধ্যমে আমরা সেই শিক্ষার দিকে এগিয়ে যাচ্ছি।’ মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চশিক্ষা বিভাগের সচিব মো. আবু বকর ছিদ্দীকের সভাপতিত্বে পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসবে বিশেষ অতিথি ছিলেন শিক্ষা উপমন্ত্রী মহিবুল হাসান চৌধুরী, স্থানীয় সংসদ সদস্য সিমিন হোসেন রিমি, কারিগরি ও মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বিভাগের সিনিয়র সচিব মো. কামাল হোসেন, গাজীপুর জেলা প্রশাসক আনিসুর রহমান, গাজীপুর জেলা পুলিশ সুপার কাজী শফিকুল আলম প্রমুখ। উৎসবে শিক্ষা উপমন্ত্রী তাঁর বক্তব্যে শিক্ষার্থীদের বই ছাড়াও জীবন থেকে, মা–বাবার কাছ থেকে শেখার পরামর্শ দেন। কবিতা ও গল্পের বই পড়তে বলেন। সারা দেশে এ বছর সব মিলিয়ে প্রায় চার কোটি শিক্ষার্থী পাচ্ছে নতুন বই। উৎসবে নিজের অভিজ্ঞতা জানিয়ে মঞ্চে বক্তব্য দেয় কাপাসিয়া পাইলট উচ্চবিদ্যালয়ের দশম শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থী মোছা. ইলমা। সে বলে, ‘বছরের প্রথম দিন হাতে বই পাওয়ার আনন্দ সবাইকে আন্দোলিত করছে। আমরা শিক্ষার্থীরা সবাই আনন্দিত।’ মহামারি করোনাভাইরাসের কারণে গত দুই বছর দেশে বই উৎসব হয়নি। ঢাকার বাইরে গাজীপুরে এবারই প্রথম এমন জাতীয় পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসব আয়োজনে সাড়া পড়েছে কাপাসিয়া তথা আশপাশের উপজেলাগুলোতে। আজ সকালে অনুষ্ঠান শুরু হওয়ার আগে স্কুলের মাঠ শিক্ষার্থীদের উপস্থিতিতে পূর্ণ হয়ে যায়। সংশ্লিষ্ট স্কুলের শিক্ষকদের তত্ত্বাবধানে বিভিন্ন স্কুল থেকে দল বেঁধে শিক্ষার্থীরা এসে জড়ো হয়। উৎসবে বিভিন্ন শ্রেণি–পেশার মানুষ উপস্থিত হন।",

        "body": "দেশের শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলে বাংলাদেশ জামায়াতে ইসলামীর সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল অধ্যাপক মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেছেন, শুধু সেক্যুলার শিক্ষা মানুষকে নৈতিক চরিত্র দিতে পারে না, বরং ইসলামের সুশিক্ষা ছাড়া এমন শিক্ষাব্যবস্থা ‘পশু তৈরি করছে, মানুষ নয়’, যার প্রমাণ আবরারের নির্মম হত্যা। সোমবার (৬ অক্টোবর) জাতীয় প্রেস ক্লাবের আব্দুস সালাম হলে শহীদ আবরার ফাহাদ দিবস উপলক্ষ্যে জাতীয় গণতান্ত্রিক পার্টি (জাগপা) আয়োজিত ‘রুখে দাঁড়াও ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদ’ শীর্ষক এক আলোচনা সভায় প্রধান বক্তা হিসেবে তিনি এসব কথা বলেন। আলোচনা সভায় সভাপতিত্ব করেন জাগপার সহ সভাপতি ও দলীয় মুখপাত্র রাশেদ প্রধান। মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, আবরার ফাহাদ কোনো ছাত্রসংগঠনের সঙ্গে যুক্ত ছিল না, সে ছিল একজন দেশপ্রেমিক মেধাবী ছাত্র। তিস্তার পানি, ফেনী নদী, গ্যাস এবং কলকাতার বন্দরের ইতিহাস নিয়ে ফেসবুকে ভারতীয় আধিপত্যবাদের বিরুদ্ধে লেখালেখি করায় বুয়েট ছাত্রলীগের নেতাকর্মীরা তাকে নির্মমভাবে পিটিয়ে হত্যা করে। তিনি বলেন, সেরা বিদ্যাপীঠের মেধাবী ছাত্ররা এমন নৃশংস কাজ করতে পারে কীভাবে? এটি প্রমাণ করে তাদের মেধা, মনন, শিক্ষা ও চরিত্রে মানবতা নেই। জামায়াতের সেক্রেটারি জেনারেল বলেন, এখন আধিপত্যবাদ মানে শুধু ভৌগোলিক সীমানা বা দেশ দখল নয়। বরং এটি হলো এক দেশ অন্য দেশে বসে ‘রিমোট কন্ট্রোলের’ মাধ্যমে শাসক বসানো, রাজনীতি, অর্থনীতি, বাজার, পররাষ্ট্রনীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণ করা। এ কারণেই বাংলাদেশ তিস্তা নদীর পানি পাচ্ছে না এবং নানাভাবে শোষিত হচ্ছে। দেশের বর্তমান রাজনৈতিক পরিস্থিতি ও আসন্ন নির্বাচন প্রসঙ্গে মিয়া গোলাম পরওয়ার বলেন, জনগণের আকাঙ্ক্ষা পূরণের জন্য একটি নির্দলীয় অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারের অধীনে অবাধ ও সুষ্ঠু নির্বাচন দরকার। বিদ্যমান রাষ্ট্র কাঠামোকে বদলে দিয়ে রাজনৈতিক ও সাংবিধানিক সংস্কারের মাধ্যমে নতুন একটি রাষ্ট্র কাঠামো গঠন করতে হবে। এ সংস্কারের মধ্য দিয়ে এমন একটি রাষ্ট্রযন্ত্র তৈরি হবে, যেখানে নতুন করে আর কোনো ফ্যাসিস্ট কিংবা হাসিনার জন্ম হবে না। তিনি বলেন, আসন্ন নির্বাচনে ইসলামী শক্তি ও দেশপ্রেমিক শক্তির মধ্যে যে সমঝোতার সম্ভাবনা দেখা দিয়েছে, কোনো আধিপত্যবাদী শক্তি যেন সেই ঐক্যের পথে বাধা সৃষ্টি না করতে পারে। পাশাপাশি ভারতের সঙ্গে সমতার ভিত্তিতে ও ন্যায্যতার মাধ্যমে সুসম্পর্ক বজায় রাখার ব্যবস্থা করতে হবে।",

        "body": "A massive protest rally demanding justice for Inqilab Mancha spokesperson Sharif Osman Bin Hadi was held at the Shahbagh intersection in the capital on Saturday. Inqilab Mancha organised the rally. It gave 24hrs ultimatum to arrest Hadi’s killers. Following Hadi’s burial on the Dhaka University campus, thousands of protesters gathered at Shahbagh. Processions from different parts of the city arrived in succession and eventually converged at the busy intersection to press their demand for justice over his killing. During the demonstration, protesters raised slogans including “Delhi or Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka,” “Modi or Hadi? Hadi, Hadi,” “We want justice,” and “Catch Awami League, put them behind bars.” The protesters began dispersing around 5:15pm, after which traffic gradually resumed on the Shahbagh-Matsya Bhaban, Shahbagh-Karwan Bazar, and Shahbagh-Science Lab roads, which had remained blocked during the protest. Some demonstrators were also seen hurling shoes at an effigy bearing the photograph of Law Adviser Asif Nazrul during the rally. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Inqilab Mancha and secretary of the Liberation War and Democratic Movement of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, called on people to join the protest. “Everyone come to Shahbagh,” she wrote in a Facebook post following Hadi’s funeral. For security reasons, law enforcement agencies barricaded the road from Hotel InterContinental Dhaka towards Minto Road. A large contingent of police, APBn, and Border Guard Bangladesh personnel was deployed in the area, while water cannons and armoured personnel carriers were also positioned at the site. Earlier in the day, Sharif Osman Hadi was laid to rest beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on the Dhaka University campus after his namaz-e-janaza was held at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad under tight security. From the morning, mourners had gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in small processions to attend the funeral prayer, which was joined by a large crowd.Hadi’s death has sparked protests in Dhaka and several other districts since Thursday night, with demonstrators continuing to demand justice for him.",

        "body": "Iranian protester Erfan Soltani, who was widely reported last month to have been sentenced to death over anti-government demonstrations, has been released on bail, according to media and rights groups.\n\nSoltani, 26, was detained on 8 January in Fardis, near Tehran, amid nationwide protests that triggered a violent response from security forces. His family was later told by authorities that he was facing imminent execution, though no further details were provided, Norway-based Kurdish rights group Hengaw said, reports UNB.\n\nIran’s judiciary later rejected claims that Soltani had received a death sentence, stating instead that he was charged with security-related offences punishable by imprisonment, reports BBC.\n\nHis lawyer, Amir Mousakhani, told AFP that Soltani was freed on bail on Saturday and had his personal belongings, including his mobile phone, returned. A bail amount of two billion tomans—about $12,600—was posted to secure his release.\n\nHengaw and Iranian outlets, including semi-official news agency Isna, also confirmed the development.\n\nSoltani, a clothing shop owner, drew international attention after reports emerged that he was set to be executed. A relative previously told BBC Persian that a death sentence had allegedly been issued within just two days through an unusually fast legal process.\n\nThe reports prompted international reaction, including warnings from then US President Donald Trump of “very strong action” should executions proceed. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, cautioned that any attack on Iran would ignite a wider regional conflict.\n\nIranian authorities dismissed foreign media reports about Soltani’s execution as false, while Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was no intention to carry out hangings. Hengaw later reported that Soltani’s execution had been postponed, citing family sources.\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations say the death toll from the unrest continues to rise. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency claims more than 6,300 people have been killed since protests began in late December, with thousands more deaths under investigation. Iran Human Rights has warned the total could surpass 25,000.\n\nProtesters have told the BBC that the scale and intensity of the crackdown were unprecedented. On Sunday, Khamenei accused demonstrators of attacking police, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and public institutions, including banks and mosques.",

Several groups, including the Independent Ebtedayee Madrasah Teachers’ Union, the teachers of schools for students with disabilities, and the United Non-MPO Unity Council began separate sit-in demonstrations near the press club in the morning. Traffic congestion began in the area at about 2:30pm when several thousand teachers, under the platform of the Independent Ebtedayee Madrassah Teachers’ Union, brought out a march towards the chief adviser’s residence Jamuna, and were intercepted by the police at Kadam Foara, after marching a few yards. Sunday was the 21st day of the continuous sit-in programme of the ebtedayee madrassah teachers in the National Press Club area. After facing the police barricade, the protesting madrassah teachers sat down, which ultimately blocked one side of the road. They have been demanding the immediate implementation of the government’s January 28 announcement that all approved independent ebtedayee madrasahs would be nationalised. Due to the blockade, traffic movement became standstill on both ends of the blockade point. As time passed, traffic congestion spread to the nearby areas, which affected several other areas, including Matshyabhaba, Shahbagh, Banglamotor, Paltan, Bijoy Sarani, Naya Paltan, Mouchak, Gulistan, and some other parts of Old Dhaka. The platform’s chairman, Mokhlesur Rahman, said that they withdrew their blockade from the road at about 6:00pm after a fruitful meeting with the education ministry officials. He, however, said that they would continue their movement until their demand was met. Meanwhile, several thousand teachers under the United Non-MPO Unity Council also staged a sit-in in front of the Press Club, demanding that the government bring all approved non-MPO educational institutions under MPO facilities. They also brought out a procession in the afternoon. The procession paraded nearby roads. Teachers and staff members of schools for disabled students, on the other hand, held a march towards the Bangladesh Secretariat in the afternoon, demanding recognition of their institutions and declaration of monthly pay order for them. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s deputy commissioner for media and public relations, Talebur Rahman, in a press release, said that simultaneous street protests by several groups disrupted traffic at different places in the capital. ‘These (the street protests) have disrupted traffic on several important roads, causing widespread public suffering and severe traffic congestion in some parts of the capital,’ he said. The police said that traffic movement became normal after 6:00pm.",
