        "title": "Education policy 2O1O: Keeping the promise",
        "body": "A new National Education Policy was announced by the government in June 2010. It had the potential of initiating a process of much needed reform in the educational system of the country. In over two years since the policy was adopted, progress has been slow and lacklustre -- bringing about the change envisaged in the policy needs a surge of energy and a sense of urgency. The grand coalition that formed the government after the general election, in December 2008, had presented a political manifesto containing a \"vision for change.\" It offered Vision 2021 -- which outlined goals to be fulfilled by 2021 - the 50th anniversary of independent Bangladesh, which also happens to be the 100th anniversary of birth of the Founding Father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The political pledge Vision 2021 is still to be fleshed out, but the headline items related to education and human resource development can be listed. Achievement of universal primary education, extending this stage to grade 8; elimination of illiteracy; creating a new generation skilled in and equipped with technical and scientific knowledge; better remunerations for teachers; and overall improvement of quality and equity in education. It also promised the formulation of an education policy fit for the contemporary age. There are other Vision 2021 goals pertinent for educational development -- building the Digital Bangladesh through extensive use and capacity development in digital technology; creating gainful employment opportunities for at least 90 million skilled workers; and ensuring equal status for women in all spheres of society and the state. A key item relevant for educational development is governance and management, particularly, the idea that local government bodies would be at the centre of planning and management of development activities. With this end, local government authorities at the district and upazila levels would be empowered to become self-reliant and autonomous. In addition, the election pledge of the Bangladesh Awami League for the five-year term promised continuation of stipends for girls, removing criminal violence and session-jam from education institutions, lbuilding new secondary schools and improving existing ones in the capital city and districts and vocational institutes in each upazila in phases; and making IT instruction compulsory in secondary schools by 2013 and in primary schools by 2021. The education policy The 18-member National Education Policy Formulation Committee comprising distinguished educationists presented their report in a short time, after extensive consultation with professional and stakeholder groups. The policy was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in June 2010, then was endorsed in December, 2010 by the national parliament -- incidentally, the stamp of endorsement came from the Parliament without any discussion in the relevant Parliamentary Committees or debate in the Parliament. The key features of the education policy recommendations provide a framework for fulfilling the role of the educational system in the nation's human resource development. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Universal education up to grade 8: One-year pre-primary education, and primary education extended to grade 8, should become universal within the next decade. It is agreed that the diversity of provisions in primary and secondary education -- government, government-assisted, NGO and private sector schools, and the madrasa -- would continue, but all institutions will have to follow a common core curriculum and adopt minimum common standards regarding learning content and provisions. Multiple delivery modes with common core curriculum and standards: The common core curriculum for all types of secondary level institutions (including madrasa) will include Bangla, English, mathematics, science, Bangladesh studies, and IT. These will be complemented by additional subjects pertinent for each major stream -- general, vocational, and madrasa. In addition to the vocational stream in schools, there will be various forms of skill training activities according to graded national skill standards designed to meet skill needs in domestic and overseas employment markets. Instruction in science and IT would be given special attention. Literacy and non-formal education: A literacy programme to eliminate adult illiteracy by 2014 is proposed. Non-formal education is seen as a means of providing a second chance to those who drop out of formal schools, complementing the \"literacy campaign.\" Quality improvement in tertiary education: Tertiary education institutions, both public and private, would be encouraged to take responsibility to establish and maintain quality standards within agreed framework and to ensure effective use of resources. A four-year degree programme should be acceptable higher education qualification for most occupations except for those aiming for teaching, research and other jobs that call for specialized expertise. A three credit English course should be compulsory for all degree students. Various quality enhancing investments in facilities and teacher upgrading are proposed. Pedagogic technology such as internet and education television channels should be supported. Specialized professional education in medicine, agriculture, engineering, law and business should be made more practical and their quality enhanced with involvement of the professional bodies. Student assessment to discourage rote learning: Assessment of learners' achievement should be based on public examinations and continuous evaluation by teachers, which should aim at assessing cognitive, affective and reasoning domains. Major public examination will be at the end of the 12th grade. Other examinations will be organized at the district/upazila levels at the end of 5th, 8th and 10th grades to award scholarships and evaluate system performance. All exams should be aimed at discouraging rote learning. Teachers' status, incentives and training: Teachers' recruitment, training, professional support and remuneration should be key elements of the strategy for improving quality in education. A Teacher Recruitment and Development Commission should be established to recruit teachers and support their professional development. Governance and management measures: A consolidated education law should be enacted providing a legal framework for educational governance and management in line with the purposes of the new policy. A permanent education commission should be formed to guide implementation of policy objectives and consider adjustments in education policy over time. Management of primary education should be decentralised with greater involvement of community and parents and greater authority for schools. Secondary education should be decentralised to upazila, district and division levels. The University Grants Commission should have greater authority and be renamed as Higher Education Council. Accreditation Councils should be formed to encourage improvement and self-regulation in quality of tertiary institutions. Incentives should be given for faculty research. The National University's affiliating function should be decentralised to divisional levels by establishing branches. It can be seen that the policy recommendations are in the form of normative goals or preferences sometimes expressed in general terms. Implementation of the policy will require establishment of mechanisms and processes, preparation of phased operational plans, and reconciliation of differing views and making choices among options on certain issues. This can happen only with the setting up of appropriate mechanisms and processes. The sixth five year national development plan (2011-15) could be an important mechanism for implementing the operational plan and program with provision for adequate resources, appropriate coordination and necessary monitoring and adjustments of plans as needed. However, the five-year plan is called an indicative plan, rather than an operational guide for annual and medium term budget allocations, and the basis for monitoring and assessing implementation of programmes and budgets, and making adjustments. A plethora of committees headed by officials of the ministries has been set up for education policy implementation who do not seem to have the time, professional capacity or motivation to devote effort and energy to this challenging task. In over two years since the adoption of the policy, some changes are being implemented within the existing structures and systems, as part of on-going development projects. Basic reform issues are not receiving serious and systematic professional attention. Education policy implementation is seen essentially as an administrative matter rather than carrying out fundamental reforms. Priorities for realistic action Major priorities in respect of objectives and strategies for the education sector have emerged from the new education policy and on the basis of professional and stakeholders' discourse and analysis. These need to be the core of the development efforts in education. Universalisation up to grade 8 Achieving eight-year UPE have to be a high priority for the coming decade. However, the question has fallen between the stool of two ministries with jurisdiction for school education -- which is quite a unique situation, not found in any other country. A coordinated upazila-wise assessment and planning of existing primary and junior secondary facilities is essential for this purpose through a coordinated approach of the two ministries. It is not necessary to have more classrooms and teachers in every primary school or shed grades 6 to 8 from every secondary school. A logical approach of course would be to bring all school education under one ministry. The key concern is to overcome the quality deficits and expand facilities as needed in both primary schools and in lower secondary schools. It would be unconscionable not to have education opportunities for all children at least up to grade 8 even in the year 2021. Serious planning must begin now. Equity with quality in primary and secondary education The government has made a policy move to nationalise all primary schools, first time since the then existing primary schools were nationalised in 1973. Will it follow up with nationalising ibtidayee madrasas and then grades 6 to 8 of present secondary schools and eventually all secondary schools? A pandora's box has been opened which will have critical implications for education policy implementation. A pertinent question is whether It is necessary to mix up the question of improving remuneration, status and performance of teachers with bringing total school management under a highly centralised government bureaucracy. There is much to be said for community and parents' involvement and accountability in school management. A statist mindset seems to be strong in our bureaucratic tradition and culture. Any form of government support comes with a bundle of bureaucratic strings, which, in stead of improving accountability, becomes a fertile ground for corruption and cronyism. The political class is also comfortable with centralised control rather than transparency and accountability at local and community level involving the beneficiaries. It is possible to have a governance and financing strategy that would support Upazila-wise systematic planning and financing with local government and community participation, promoting such measures as mid-day meals in school, and appropriate remuneration for teachers, without taking over total management of all schools by the central government. Larger government support including higher remuneration of teachers could be conditional on schools becoming accountable to parents/communities. A quantum leap in quality could be made if NGOs with good track records are made partners in government assisted primary/secondary schools -- providing government funds for agreed results. Rigorous trial and piloting involving research, academic and NGO practitioners could be undertaken for this purpose. Teachers as key to quality The teacher is central in the strategy to improve educational quality. It is recognised that bold and creative measures are needed to attract talented and inspired young people to teaching, keep them in the profession and create a critical mass of talented teachers in the education system. Bangladesh uniquely does not have a proper pre-service programme for teacher preparation, though this is the single largest occupational category into which tertiary education graduates enter. Recognising that a large proportion of the tertiary education products, especially form the colleges under the National University, are absorbed by the teaching profession, new initiatives for enrolling bright young people in a degree programme with education as a subject can be a key pre-service program approach for future teachers. A national education service corps established with stipends and promise of better remunerations on condition of at least five-years of service in the public system is one possibility for quality enhancement. A nucleus of highly capable people in teaching and new role models for the profession can thus be created. For such an initiative to produce the intended results, a special project has to be carried out to improve and maintain quality in the degree colleges where the education degree would be introduced. Common core contents in primary and secondary education A qualitative transformation in teaching the identified core skills and competencies in all categories of primary and secondary institutions has to be a priority. Possibilities that exist are short term measures such as contractual appointments and extra incentives for capable instructors in math, science, English and IT. Longer term measures would include special pre-service programmes (as mentioned above) and better incentives and rewards for transforming teaching as a profession. Strong bilingual competency in Bangla and English for all students completing the secondary should be a core objective -- building the foundation of Bangla competency at the primary level and similar English skills and IT skills at the secondary stage. Mobile phone operators, IT multi-nationals, Internet service providers and other businesses can be persuaded and given incentives to \"adopt\" schools to support IT instruction and IT-based improvement in pedagogy. The objective of a common core of competency for all children through basic education calls for curriculum continuity with attention to curricular burden and sequence and not pushing children irrevocably into streams (science, commerce, vocational etc.) too early at the end of grade 8. Educational systems in most countries defer these decisions at least to the end of secondary education for very sound pedagogic and social justice reasons. Assessment of learning The education policy goal is to ensure that tests and assessment of students help them move away from memorising textbooks and really acquire defined competencies. Assessment of learning has two complemetary elements -- day-to-day and periodic assessment in the classroom and school and more formal and public tests at the end of a stage of education. These are described respectively as assessment for learning -- to help children perform better; and assessment of learning -- to determine what students have learned and how the school and the education system have performed. Both are essential for quality education. The introduction of national primary school completion and junior secondary certificate examinations has produced consequences not quite foreseen. Increasingly high pass rates and high percentages of \"golden grade point average\" of 5+ are being reported with great fanfare and claims about improvement in the quality of education from one year to the next. These high scores are quite inconsistent with independent sampling of actual competency in basic skills of reading writing and math of primary and secondary students. The public tests for six subjects for primary and nine subjects after grade eight are based entirely on the textbook contents rather than actual competencies students are supposed to acquire. A competent professional and technical team should be invited to undertake research and evaluation on how the national testing serves the policy objective of assessing and improving actual competency and how this may change classroom teaching. Public testing at primary and lower secondary level -- unlike at secondary and higher secondary -- to put students in performance categories publicly and announce individual student grades publicly is contrary to international education practice. Transforming vocational and technical education Addressing the paradox -- employers' complaint about shortage of skilled workers and unfilled places in vocational institutions and sometimes unemployed graduates -- have to be addressed by redesigning the role of the public sector in vocational/technical education and training, and its operation and management. Particular attention is needed to make training responsive to market demands, locally and overseas; skill development for the informal economy where the large majority of workers are employed; and overall attention to quality of training by applying \"external efficiency\" criteria. Vocational education centres are planned to be established in each of some 500 upazila centres. Their efficiency and quality has to be ensured by responsive curriculum, flexible training methodology and employers' involvement in design and management. Literacy and NFE in a lifelong learning perspective An unattainable target of \"eliminating illiteracy\" by 2014 based on a simplistic and meaningless definition of literacy was set and, not surprisingly, little progress has been made., Literacy and non-formal education need to be conceptualized as integral components of widely available life-long learning opportunities. A nationwide network of community learning centres under local government auspices with active involvement of NGOS and community organizations can be the vehicle for life-long learning, complementing formal education. Promoting functional skills and meeting genuine learning needs on a sustainable basis should be the aim, and programmes designed and objectives defined accordingly. Consolidating Quality in Tertiary Education Tertiary education management, including public universities and colleges under the National University, is in shambles. Although participation in tertiary education remains low, expansion of tertiary education will not produce the desired results, unless acceptable quality can be ensured. The focus of tertiary education development should be on applying rigorously already established quality standards and consolidating and rationalizing existing institutions, while investment is made on a major expansion. It is difficult to see how the situation can improve until the political leadership can muster the will to catch the bull by the horns to control rampant indiscipline, crime and violence in institutions aided and abetted by partisan politics. Financing of education for equity with quality Public education allocations have actually come down as proportion of GDP and total budget since the education policy has been announced. Financing criteria and principles should be established and applied to support the objectives of quality-with-equity, such as a Upazila-wise capitation formula and institutional control of resources with accountability. Substantial new resources should be directed to teacher incentives and raising status of teaching as a profession and other quality improvement inputs. The essential measures in this respect will include: YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR Much larger resources for education setting a target of around 5 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the government budget in in 5-7 years -- using an education cess, as in India and Pakistan, as one approach; Applying a capitation formula -- allocating resources with a formula counting number of children in each Upazila and overall economic and ecological situation of the upazila; Use of public resources based on a coordinated and comprehensive plan for equity with quality for each upazila; making budget planning and implementation genuinely bottom up. Organisational/Institutional measures Far-reaching changes foreseen in Education Policy cannot be achieved by business as usual. Three critical steps will be a good start. A permanent statutory education commission with technical capacity to guide and oversee progress, as proposed in policy; Bringing all pre-university education under one Ministry for essential coordination, articulation and continuity; and A Right to Education Law that specifies rights and obligations of all and supports a decentralised, participatory and accountable national education system with equity and quality for all as the goal. YAMIN TAUSEEF JAHANGIR An education law in draft appears to be mostly about administrative measures rather than substantial reform related to decentralisation accountability, rights and obligations of different parties and resource mobilisation. A longer term view and a broad national interest perspective are essential foe educational reform. Short-term, populist and narrowly partisan approach with a time-frame of the next general election will only compound the problems further. ..........................................................................

        "title": "Minimum standard of edn a must for MPO: Farruk",
        "body": "Education Minister Dr. Osman Farruk yesterday said Monthly Pay Order (MPO) and government grants to educational institutions must not be a \"permanent settlement\". \"The educational institutions that will fail to register a minimum performance should not have the right to claim government grants and facilities,\" he said while inaugurating as chief guest the national-level programme of the 'National Education Week-2003'. Held at the Osmani Memorial Hall under the auspices of the education ministry, the function was also addressed by State Minister for Education ANM Ehsanul Haque Milon and Deputy Minister Mohammad Abdus Salam Pinto as special guests. Presided over by Education Secretary Mohammad Shahidul Alam, the inaugural function was also addressed, among others, by Director General of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Directorate Abdur Rashid and Joint Secretary of the ministry Sheikh AK Motahar Hossain. Dr. Osman Farruk said the education administration had become weak and full of irregularities and the managing committees almost \"non-functioning\" because of \"personal\" and \"coterie\" interests. \"Our government does not believe in politicisation of school and college managing committees,\" he said adding that to improve the prevailing situation, both responsibility and accountability of the governing bodies had to be enhanced. The education minister said the responsibility to improve the standard of education must be carried out jointly by its stakeholders -- teachers, students, guardians, civil society members and the government. The education minister said the curriculum as well as syllabus of the text books must be \"life-oriented\" and realistic so that real nation-building architects come out from the country's 107,000 educational institutions. The main work to attain this goal has to be carried out by 750,000 teachers employed in these institutions, he said. Turning to the quality education, the minister said \"We do not want to engage police to remove note books from the market, nor do we want to close down the private coaching centres right now.\" \"We have to go to the root of the problem and ask ourselves why students have become dependent on note books and coaching centres,\" he said, adding that teachers must perform their sacred jobs of imparting education and wisdom to their pupils in the class room for the full period of their contract hours before heading for coaching centres. \"We have to recast our education system so that the new generation can be injected with human and moral values and are well-educated,\" he said. He stressed the need for introducing an education system that is capable of achieving the basic objectives of education, like enlightening the learners, making them wise, knowledgeable and good citizens and capable of innovating new skills and strategies for nation-building purposes. Making a departure from his written speech, the education minister raised some important issues like adopting unfair means in examinations, misuse of funds and facilities, sufferings of the teachers in the corridors of education directorate and national university to get their problems addressed. At the same time, the minister hinted at some important measures his ministry is going to take to streamline this very important sector of national life. He said the education directorate and the national university would be further decentralised so that the teachers and others concerned could get their services without undergoing much hazard and inconvenience. The inaugural session was followed by National Education Conference entitled \"Education for Attaining Self-reliance\".",

        "title": "Disasters disrupt education",
        "body": "Different natural and human-made disasters are adversely affecting the country’s education sector by lowering quality of education and damaging infrastructure of the educational institutions round the year, government data show. With the changes in intensity, frequency, duration and timing of the natural disasters in recent years due to climate change, students especially the girl ones are continuing to face challenges like dropout, early marriage, poor academic performance and trafficking. Researchers and academics said that the negative impacts on the education system were increasing due to a lack of inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination, the absence of pragmatic, actionable and implementable disaster management plans of the government and a huge gap in the implementation of policies. Changes in scheduling and management of schools and disaster management policies and increasing awareness and readiness among students and teachers have been suggested by them to reduce these harsh impacts. According to the Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024, between 2013 and 2024, due to cyclones, floods and tides, 32,013 primary- to tertiary-level government and non-government educational institutions were closed, 17,603 institutions were open but classes could not be held, 17,289 institutions saw trees around them dying, 17,289 institutions’ classrooms were damaged, 13,263 institutions’ playground became unusable, 7,436 institutions were used as shelters, 4,974 institutions saw curriculum not completed properly, 4,911 institutions’ toilet system were collapsed, 4,898 institutions’ water supply system were collapsed, 3,117 institutions’ connecting roads were completely damaged, 2,003 institutions’ hall rooms were damaged, and 178 institutions had to be relocated. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 has been published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics recently based on a countrywide survey. Professor emeritus Ainun Nishat, adviser for the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research at BRAC University, said that impacts of climate change were directly related to various natural disasters. ‘Intensity, frequency, duration and timing of each of the disasters are changing,’ he said, adding ‘and obviously these have impacts on the education system.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, founder of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, said that students especially the girl ones were severely affected by the natural and human-made disasters. During any prolonged closure of the educational institutions by disasters, girls faced different types of harassment due to lack of security, he said. ‘As per my evidence-based research, in border areas like at Domar (upazila), Nilphamari (district), Bhurungamari (an upazila in Rangpur district), Bhomra port (in Satkhira district) and in Jashore border girls were being trafficked due to poverty,’ Mokaddam said. He said that their parents were being assured that their girls would return once the schools would reopen. The parents also chose early marriages for their girls during disasters, he added. The Bangladesh Education Statistics-2024 also showed that following different natural and human-made disasters, a total of 1,02,015 students, including 62,308, or 61.08 per cent, girl students, were dropped out in 2024. Out of the total dropouts, the highest 57,105 dropped out from the secondary level followed by 35,614 from colleges, 8,600 from madrasahs and 696 from the primary level. The preliminary findings of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2025 conducted by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund recently, showed that the national rate of child marriage currently was 56 per cent. The BANBEIS’s 2024 report also showed that due to the impacts of disasters, the percentage of students having performance loss in different subjects, including Bangla, English, mathematics, science, sociology, accounting and religion was 1.11 per cent at the primary level, 77.72 per cent at the secondary level, 5.37 per cent at the college level and 15.8 per cent at the madrassahs in 2024. Meanwhile, the National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (2023‐2050), prepared by the environment, forest and climate change ministry for climate change adaptation, identified 14 disasters and 11 climate stress areas in Bangladesh. Referring to the disasters and climate stress areas, climate change specialist Ainun Nishat said that the authorities had to develop an understanding how these were impacting the education system. First, he said, there will be more intensified and prolonged heat waves but all classrooms cannot be made air-conditioned. He recalled that in the 50s, 60s and 70s, the primary school classes were held between 7:00am and 10:00am or 11:00am to avoid the hottest time of the day. The timing of the rainy season is changing also, which is closely connected with the crop planting and male students as they have to help their parents on fields, Ainun said. Cyclones usually happen in eight weeks from March 15 to May 15 or October 15 to December 15, he said. During the cyclones and floods, people take shelter in the educational institutions and nobody wants to leave the shelters quickly after the disasters, he said. ‘The intensities of disasters are changing and there has to be policy change regarding school hours,’ he said. Ainun said that the environment ministry was carrying out the national adaptation plan without coordinating with the education ministry. ‘Every ministry will be affected by disasters,’ he said, adding, ‘in our country inter-sectoral and inter-ministerial coordination is very poor.’ Professor Khondoker Mokaddam Hossain, who was a member of the NAP feasibility committee, said that during the cyclones and floods, educational institutions were not only damaged but also used as shelters, which caused dislocation and prolonged closure of these institutions. He mentioned that two years ago during a flash flood, 94 per cent of areas in Sunamganj and 90 per cent areas in Sylhet were gone under water for 40 to 45 days. ‘For the past four decades, these educational institutions remained in this fragile state and unfortunately we are not getting out of this situation,’ he said. The prolonged closure of these institutions also affected students physically and mentally, he said, adding that due to the discontinuity of education, many students dropped out in an increasing rate. Mokaddam said that there were some sort and immediate rehabilitation initiatives but no pragmatic, actionable and implementable short-, middle- and long-term plans for disaster management. About the existing plans, he said, ‘There is a huge gap in implementing these.’ He said that during the earthquakes in Dhaka in November, some of the traumatised Dhaka University students jumped from buildings and got injured. ‘There should be awareness and readiness among the students and teachers,’ he said. He termed fire incidents, road accidents, discrimination in education and waterlogging in urban areas human-made disasters. There are 1,50,007 primary- to tertiary-level educational institutions (primary schools, junior secondary schools, secondary schools, school section of the secondary school, colleges and madrassahs) in the country.",

        "title": "Rights to education and health",
        "body": "Globally, it is recognised that ‘educating children’ gives the next generation the most effective tools to fight poverty, prevent diseases, build resilience and create a progressive and peaceful society as ‘good health and well-being for all’ is the foundation of sustainable development. So, to protect and promote the universal rights to education and health are requisites for all aspects of social and economic development. Two articles, 17 and 28, of the constitution entrench universal rights to education, especially free primary education, as well as rights to freedom of choice to get the higher education keeping to everyone’s potential and merit. Article 18 (1) highlights the state’s primary duty to raise the nutrition level and to improve the public health. So, the constitutional mandate and the given commitment to the several international conventions such as United Nations’ Convention on Child Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights oblige obligate Bangladesh to ensure free access to quality education and improved health services. Despite being the basic human right, the constitution does not recognise the health right as the universal human rights. The global development framework, the Sustainable Development Goals, commits to leaving no one behind, which is a great premise to working together with international development partners to provide quality education and health services for all. What is the ground reality in both sectors: education and health? National statistics show that 40.72 per cent of children and youths are out of education because of multifaceted causes as well as the maternal and under-five child mortality rates are 163 per 100,000 live births (maternal mortality) and 30.6 deaths under 1000 live births (under-five mortality) respectively. This clearly indicates the state could not protect the education and health rights as the universal human rights. In addition, 51.4 per cent of girl children are married off they reach 18 and 11.3 per cent of children are engaged in labour. This is also a gross violation of children’s rights to development with their full potential. The disparities between rural and urban education and health services in terms of access to and the quality of services are unimaginable. The people in several poverty pockets such as delta, coastal and haor areas do not have minimum level of access to health care services and to quality education. There are union health complexes and government primary schools, but they are almost completely dysfunctional for lack of resources, isolation, negligence of the national and local government authorities, overlooking and exclusionary approach and the frame of mind of the political and community leaders, prevailing rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability and people’s ignorance and lack of voice for their rights and entitlement. However, only in some big cities, particularly in the capital city, a very few education and health facilities and institutions provide acceptable standards of health and education services. But that are expensive and completely out of reach of ordinary people. Only the affluent group of people, about 10 per cent of the population, can afford this good quality of health and education services. And, almost 90 per cent of the population and all of rural and marginalised people, who are penniless and powerless, receive education and health services from the dysfunctional and retrospective facilities and systems. As a result, not only individuals face the adverse impact of the dysfunctional health and education services, but also national development also suffers in all aspects. The health and education services have completely been turned into business through the hegemonic political systems and monopoly and manipulative business approaches. Good quality of education and health service systems are the main engines of all kinds of development, economic and social. But keeping the majority portion of the population out of the quality services, a country cannot get on the development highway. Research shows that one dollar’s investment in education and health sectors generates more than one dollar’s return; but in all other sectors, it creates less than one dollar’s return. It proves that the rates of returns on investment in education and health sectors are much higher than that of another sectors. The good quality of education and health services is also the most effective tools to achieve the sustainable development, including poverty alleviation and building resilience of individual, community and systems to climate change, natural and artificial shocks and disasters. Definitely, the constraint of resources — financial and expertise — is a challenge to provide good quality of education and health services as the national budget allocation is much less than what is required. Along with this limited resource allocation, rampant corruption, lack of transparency and accountability, political engagement of professionals, monopoly business approaches, denial of human rights and the lack of the rule of law destroy the education and health systems. A comprehensive, rights-based-approach is required to enable both parties, service recipients and providers, as rights holders and legal and moral duty bearers respectively so that they can effectively perform their duties in all kinds of businesses and services. The marginalised and excluded section of the population as rights holders need to be able enough to receive technical and non-technical supports to claim their rights and entitlement accordingly. A rights-based approach is complementary with humanitarian and democratic norms, the rule of law, transparency and accountability and it impacts well-being, progress and prosperity. It is imperative to create such an inclusive, integrated and rights-based business environment and platforms that help to attain the expected outcomes, promoting ethical business standards with humanity and prohibiting unethical and illegal business that only makes money. So, improvement in the quality of education and health services requires some important policy and strategic actions. Demonstrating strategic, visionary and people-centric leadership would dismantle the hegemonic myths, bringing all actors together to the playground with the highest standard of professionalism, accountability and transparency. Business syndicates of rights-based services systems over the monopoly and manipulative business systems in education and health sectors should be eliminated. Primary and essential health care and services must be free for all people and specialised health services must be affordable for the rural poor and marginalised people with an equitable access to good public health. Physicians must stay in community and union health complexes and provide specialised health services for rural people. Public and private partnership should be attempted at to address the challenges of resources constraints. The marginalised and excluded groups should be empowered to protect their rights to quality services. The government implements social safety net programmes to support the extreme poor and people with disabilities, but that is not effective because of political bias, corruption, abuse, exploitation and exclusion. Rights-based, service-oriented education and health systems should be established. It is essential to raise the floors of the extreme poor and marginalised people with education and empowerment programmes and initiatives so that they can raise their voice for their rights and entitlement. It is imperative that Bangladesh now should implement a comprehensive reform initiative, but no reforms will sustain in the long run if the reforms do not focus on education and health systems.

        "title": "No edn reform commission reflects neglect: BNP",
        "body": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Abdul Moyeen Khan alleged that despite many reform commissions were formed in other sectors post uprising, none was set up for education, reflecting the interim government’s neglect of the sector. Having questioned the mindset that education reform was not necessary, the BNP standing committee member asked if the previous regime took education to its highest level, leaving no room for further improvement. His remarks came on Thursday at a discussion meeting organised by Nagarik Oikya at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the capital. Moyeen Khan at the time also said that the status of the teachers under the government’s Monthly Pay Order system was low and their treatment was also poor. He called ‘heart-rending’ and ‘shameful’ the recent use of tear gas and baton charge by the police to disperse the teachers demonstrating for pay rise and other facilities. Criticising the government for increasing the house rent allowance by only Tk 500, he questioned how teachers would be able to manage expenses with such paltry amounts. The event was chaired by Nagarik Oikya president Mahmudur Rahman Manna. Calling teachers the ‘makers of human beings’, Moyeen Khan said that no country could achieve prominence without a strong education system supported by dedicated teachers and students. If the public administration employees or the police received generous benefits, the same should be provided to teachers too, he said. Moyeen Khan further criticised the past 15 years of Awami League regime’s policy, alleging efforts to undermine education by devaluing teachers, destroying textbooks, and dismantling school and university courses. He reminded the meeting that the 2024 Anti-Discrimination Movement stemmed from the demand for fair opportunities in the public service jobs without any discrimination. He also observed that the main dissatisfaction arose from the appointment process through the Public Service Commission and questioned whether students were pursuing education for nation-building or merely for personal career advancement. Moyeen Khan also warned against the idea of an upper house for professionals who have not been elected by people. He said that while engineers, doctors and other highly qualified professionals played a crucial advisory role, they could not make decisions about the country’s governance without a public mandate. The BNP leader also said that professional people held an inherent urge for assuming control, which he stated as a form of ‘self-criticism’, stressing that in a democracy based on popular representation, governance decisions must be made by elected representatives.",

        "body": "শিক্ষামন্ত্রী দীপু মনি বলেছেন, সারা দেশে আজ বই উৎসব হয়েছে। সারা পৃথিবীতে বাংলাদেশ অনন্য দৃষ্টান্ত স্থাপন করেছে, যেখানে বছরের প্রথম দিন বই উৎসব হয় এবং কোটি কোটি শিক্ষার্থী এ বই উৎসবে অংশগ্রহণ করে। এ বছর মাধ্যমিকের পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসব অনুষ্ঠিত হয়েছে গাজীপুরের কাপাসিয়া উপজেলার কাপাসিয়া সরকারি পাইলট উচ্চবিদ্যালয়ে। এ অনুষ্ঠানে প্রধান অতিথির বক্তব্যে এসব কথা বলেন শিক্ষামন্ত্রী। আজ রোববার সকাল সাড়ে ১০টায় বেলুন উড়িয়ে উৎসবের উদ্বোধন করেন দীপু মনি। পরে দুপুর সাড়ে ১২টায় বিভিন্ন শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থীর হাতে বিনা মূল্যের নতুন বই তুলে দেন তিনি। অনুষ্ঠানে নতুন শিক্ষাক্রম নিয়ে কথা বলেন শিক্ষামন্ত্রী। তিনি বলেন, ‘এমন একটি শিক্ষাক্রম গঠন করেছি, যেখানে শিক্ষা হবে আনন্দময়। পরীক্ষা নিয়ে শিক্ষার্থীরা ভীত থাকবে না। পরীক্ষা থাকবে। তবে ধারাবাহিক মূল্যায়নের মধ্য দিয়ে অনুশীলন হবে। প্রতিদিন শিক্ষার্থীরা তা করে শিখবে। কোনো মুখস্থবিদ্যার বালাই থাকবে না। সক্রিয় শিখন হবে। অভিজ্ঞতাভিত্তিক শিখন হবে। যা শিখবে তা আবার প্রয়োগ করতে শিখবে। কেমন করে শিখতে হয়, তা–ও শিখে ফেলবে।’ বই বিতরণ নিয়ে একটি পরিসংখ্যান তুলে ধরেন দীপু মনি। তিনি বলেন, ‘২০১০ সাল থেকে ২০২৩ সাল পর্যন্ত সরকার শিক্ষার্থীদের মধ্যে ৪৩৪ কোটি ৪৫ লাখ ৮০ হাজার ২১১টি বই বিনা মূল্যে বিতরণ করেছে। এটি পৃথিবীর যেকোনো জায়গার জন্য অচিন্তনীয় বিষয়। কিন্তু কাজটি বঙ্গবন্ধু–কন্যার নির্দেশনায় আমরা প্রতিবছর করে যাচ্ছি।’ শিক্ষামন্ত্রী আরও বলেন, ‘শেখ হাসিনা আমাদের ডিজিটাল বাংলাদেশ তৈরি করে দিয়েছেন। বাংলাদেশের সরকার হবে স্মার্ট সরকার, অর্থনীতি হবে স্মার্ট অর্থনীতি, সমাজ হবে স্মার্ট সমাজ, এসব গড়ার জন্য দরকার স্মার্ট শিক্ষা। নতুন শিক্ষাক্রম তৈরির মাধ্যমে আমরা সেই শিক্ষার দিকে এগিয়ে যাচ্ছি।’ মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চশিক্ষা বিভাগের সচিব মো. আবু বকর ছিদ্দীকের সভাপতিত্বে পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসবে বিশেষ অতিথি ছিলেন শিক্ষা উপমন্ত্রী মহিবুল হাসান চৌধুরী, স্থানীয় সংসদ সদস্য সিমিন হোসেন রিমি, কারিগরি ও মাদ্রাসা শিক্ষা বিভাগের সিনিয়র সচিব মো. কামাল হোসেন, গাজীপুর জেলা প্রশাসক আনিসুর রহমান, গাজীপুর জেলা পুলিশ সুপার কাজী শফিকুল আলম প্রমুখ। উৎসবে শিক্ষা উপমন্ত্রী তাঁর বক্তব্যে শিক্ষার্থীদের বই ছাড়াও জীবন থেকে, মা–বাবার কাছ থেকে শেখার পরামর্শ দেন। কবিতা ও গল্পের বই পড়তে বলেন। সারা দেশে এ বছর সব মিলিয়ে প্রায় চার কোটি শিক্ষার্থী পাচ্ছে নতুন বই। উৎসবে নিজের অভিজ্ঞতা জানিয়ে মঞ্চে বক্তব্য দেয় কাপাসিয়া পাইলট উচ্চবিদ্যালয়ের দশম শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থী মোছা. ইলমা। সে বলে, ‘বছরের প্রথম দিন হাতে বই পাওয়ার আনন্দ সবাইকে আন্দোলিত করছে। আমরা শিক্ষার্থীরা সবাই আনন্দিত।’ মহামারি করোনাভাইরাসের কারণে গত দুই বছর দেশে বই উৎসব হয়নি। ঢাকার বাইরে গাজীপুরে এবারই প্রথম এমন জাতীয় পাঠ্যপুস্তক উৎসব আয়োজনে সাড়া পড়েছে কাপাসিয়া তথা আশপাশের উপজেলাগুলোতে। আজ সকালে অনুষ্ঠান শুরু হওয়ার আগে স্কুলের মাঠ শিক্ষার্থীদের উপস্থিতিতে পূর্ণ হয়ে যায়। সংশ্লিষ্ট স্কুলের শিক্ষকদের তত্ত্বাবধানে বিভিন্ন স্কুল থেকে দল বেঁধে শিক্ষার্থীরা এসে জড়ো হয়। উৎসবে বিভিন্ন শ্রেণি–পেশার মানুষ উপস্থিত হন।",

        "body": "পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নে সরকারি-বেসরকারি ৪০টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান রয়েছে। এর মধ্যে ১৩টিই ফকিরহাট এলাকায়। দুই কিলোমিটার দূরত্বের মধ্যে গড়ে উঠেছে ১৩টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান। সব প্রতিষ্ঠানেই প্রয়োজনীয় শিক্ষক-শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। পাবলিক পরীক্ষায় ফলও ভালো। এত কম দূরত্বে এত শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান গড়ে ওঠায় এলাকায় ঝরে পড়া শিক্ষার্থীর সংখ্যা যেমন কমেছে, তেমনি বেড়েছে উচ্চশিক্ষা নেওয়ার হারও। ওই এলাকার নাম ফকিরহাট। এ নামের সঙ্গে মিল রেখে স্থানীয়ভাবে এলাকাটি ‘শিক্ষার হাট’ হিসেবে পরিচিতি পেয়েছে। এটি গাইবান্ধার পলাশবাড়ী উপজেলার পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নের বালাবামুনিয়া গ্রামে। পবনাপুর ইউনিয়ন পরিষদের (ইউপি) ভারপ্রাপ্ত চেয়ারম্যান শাহিনুর বেগম বলেন, প্রায় ২০ হাজার মানুষের এ ইউনিয়নে সরকারি-বেসরকারি ৪০টি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান রয়েছে। এসব প্রতিষ্ঠানের ১৩টিই ফকিরহাট এলাকায়। এর মধ্যে প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় সাতটি, মাধ্যমিক বিদ্যালয় দুইটি, কলেজ দুইটি ও মাদ্রাসা দুইটি। পলাশবাড়ী উপজেলা সদর থেকে ১৪ কিলোমিটার দূরে বালাবামুনিয়া গ্রাম। এ গ্রামেরই প্রাণকেন্দ্র ফকিরহাট। এখানে একটি বাজার, ঈদগাহ ও ডাকঘরও আছে। ফকিরহাট বাজার ঘেঁষে সীমানাপ্রাচীর দিয়ে ঘেরা ফকিরহাট সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয়। এ দুটি প্রতিষ্ঠান একই ক্যাম্পাসে অবস্থিত। গত বৃহস্পতিবার দুপুরে ফটক পেরিয়ে ভেতরে ঢুকতেই কানে এল শিশুদের কলরব। তারা প্রাথমিক ও মাধ্যমিক বিদ্যালয়ের শিক্ষার্থী। শ্রেণিকক্ষ থেকেই তাদের পড়ার সুর ভেসে আসছিল। কক্ষে ঢুকে সব ক্লাসেই শিক্ষার্থীদের সরব উপস্থিতি পাওয়া গেল। প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক দিলীপ কুমার সরকার বলেন, বিদ্যালয়টি ১৯৪৩ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত। এখন এখানে ১৩৫ শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। সর্বশেষ পাবলিক পরীক্ষায় পাসের হার শতভাগ। ২০১৯ সালের মেধাবৃত্তি (ট্যালেন্ট পুলে) দুজন ও সর্বশেষ একজন বৃত্তি পায়। প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ের আঙিনা পেরিয়েই ১৯৩৮ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয়। ততক্ষণে মধ্যাহ্ন বিরতি হয়েছে। শিক্ষার্থীদের পদচারণে মুখর হয়েছে মাঠ। কেউ ফুটবল নিয়ে মেতেছে, কেউবা খেলছে ক্রিকেট। মেয়েরাও দাঁড়িয়াবান্ধা, বউছিসহ নানা খেলায় ব্যস্ত। এ বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক শফিকুল ইসলাম সরকার। তিনি বলেন, এখানে শিক্ষার্থী ৫৬৩ জন। এর মধ্যে ছাত্রী ২০০, ছাত্র ৩৬৩। সর্বশেষ পাবলিক পরীক্ষার ফল বেশ ভালো। পাসের হার ৭৯ দশমিক ৩৪। শিক্ষক ১৫ জন, কর্মচারী ৬ জন। স্থানীয় লোকজন জানান, এ গ্রামে প্রথমে মরহুম মোতাহার আলী খন্দকার ও হবিবর রহমান খন্দকারের সার্বিক সহযোগিতায় ১৯৩৮ সালে ফকিরহাট দ্বিমুখী উচ্চবিদ্যালয় গড়ে ওঠে। ১৯৬৭ সালে এ বিদ্যালয়ের প্রধান শিক্ষক ছিলেন ফজলুল হক খন্দকার। তাঁর নেতৃত্বে বিদ্যালয়টি ধীরে ধীরে ভালো ফল করতে থাকে। আশপাশের গ্রামের অভিভাবকেরাও বিদ্যালয়টিতে সন্তানদের পড়াতে আগ্রহী হয়ে ওঠেন। বিদ্যালয়টিতে এখন ১৪ জন শিক্ষক ও ৫৬৩ জন শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। ফজলুল হকের প্রচেষ্টায় আরও কয়েকটি শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠান গড়ে ওঠে। অবসরপ্রাপ্ত শিক্ষক ফজলুল হক বলেন, ‘সে সময় আমি বাড়ি বাড়ি গিয়ে শিক্ষার্থীদের লেখাপড়ার খোঁজখবর নিয়েছি। দুর্বল শিক্ষার্থীদের বাড়তি পাঠদান, অর্থ ও বই–খাতা দিয়ে সহায়তা করেছি।’ বিদ্যালয় দুটি থেকে বের হয়ে ১০০ গজ পূর্বে এলেই হাতের বাঁ পাশে প্রাচীরঘেরা ফকিরহাট শহীদ স্মৃতি ডিগ্রি কলেজের ক্যাম্পাস। এখানে ঢুকে দেখা গেল, কোনো কক্ষে চলছে পাঠদান। কোথাও আড্ডা দিচ্ছেন শিক্ষার্থীরা। কলেজটির শিক্ষার্থী নুরী আকতার বলেন, তিনি এ গ্রামের বাসিন্দা। এখান থেকেই প্রাথমিক, মাধ্যমিক ও উচ্চমাধ্যমিক পাস করে এখন স্নাতকে পড়ছেন। কষ্ট করে দূরে কোথাও না গিয়ে বাড়িতে থেকেই উচ্চশিক্ষার সুযোগ পেয়েছেন। এতে একদিকে যেমন বাড়ির কাজে সাহায্য করতে পেরেছেন, তেমনি পড়াশোনার খরচও বেঁচেছে। কলেজটির ভারপ্রাপ্ত অধ্যক্ষ আবদুল আলিম খন্দকার জানান, তাঁর কলেজে প্রায় ৭০০ শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। সর্বশেষ পাসের হার ৬৩ দশমিক ৬৯। এবার স্নাতকে পাসের হার ছিল ৮৬ ভাগ। ফকিরহাট বাজার থেকে ৪০০ গজ দক্ষিণে ফকিরহাট আল্লার দরগা দাখিল মাদ্রাসা অবস্থিত। ৪১০ গজ পূর্বে শহীদ খায়রুল আলম উচ্চবালিকা বিদ্যালয়। মাদ্রাসাটি ১৯৯৪ সালে ও বালিকা বিদ্যালয়টি ১৯৭৩ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত। বাজার থেকে ৬৫০ গজ দূরে ২০০৫ সালে ফকিরহাট মদিনাতুল উলুম কওমি হাফিজিয়া মাদ্রাসা গড়ে ওঠে। বাজার থেকে ৫৫০ গজ দূরে ১৯৮৪ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়। ৬৫০ গজ দূরে ১৯৯০ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া বালিকা সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ৬০০ গজ দূরে ১৯৯৫ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া ফকিরপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়। দুই কিলোমিটার দূরে ১৯৮৫ সালে বালাবামুনিয়া আদর্শ সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় ও ২০০ গজ দূরে ২০০০ সালে স্থাপিত ফকিরহাট মহিলা কলেজ। দেড় কিলোমিটার দূরে ১৯৯৫ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয় বালাবামুনিয়া পূর্বপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় এবং ৬০০ গজ দুরে ১৯৮৫ সালে স্থাপিত সমিতিরহাট বালাবামুনিয়া উত্তরপাড়া সরকারি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়। পবনাপুর ইউনিয়নের দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত সহকারী প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা কর্মকর্তা (এইউইও) আবদুল হাই বলেন, কাছাকাছি এতগুলো বিদ্যালয় থাকলেও সবগুলোতেই পর্যাপ্ত শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছে। এত বেশি বিদ্যালয় থাকায় এলাকাটিতে ঝরে পড়া শিক্ষার্থীও নেই বললেই চলে। গাইবান্ধার সহকারী জেলা প্রাথমিক শিক্ষা কর্মকর্তা এসএম আরশাদ বলেন, প্রতিষ্ঠানের চাহিদা থাকায় ফকিরহাটের ওই সব প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়গুলো আগেই গড়ে ওঠেছে। পরবর্তীতে সেগুলোকে সরকারি করা হয়। তবে নতুন করে প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয় প্রতিষ্ঠার ক্ষেত্রে একটি থেকে আরেকটি দূরত্ব ২ কিলোমিটার হতে হবে। তিনি আরও বলেন, প্রতিটি প্রাথমিক বিদ্যালয়ে ন্যূনতম ৫০ জন শিক্ষার্থী থাকতে হবে। এর কম হলে ঊর্ধ্বতন কর্তৃপক্ষকে জানাতে হয়। সে বিষয়ে তারা সিদ্ধান্ত দেবেন। তবে ফকিরহাটের বিদ্যালয়গুলোতে প্রয়োজনীয় শিক্ষার্থী ও শিক্ষক রয়েছে।",

        "body": "A massive protest rally demanding justice for Inqilab Mancha spokesperson Sharif Osman Bin Hadi was held at the Shahbagh intersection in the capital on Saturday. Inqilab Mancha organised the rally. It gave 24hrs ultimatum to arrest Hadi’s killers. Following Hadi’s burial on the Dhaka University campus, thousands of protesters gathered at Shahbagh. Processions from different parts of the city arrived in succession and eventually converged at the busy intersection to press their demand for justice over his killing. During the demonstration, protesters raised slogans including “Delhi or Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka,” “Modi or Hadi? Hadi, Hadi,” “We want justice,” and “Catch Awami League, put them behind bars.” The protesters began dispersing around 5:15pm, after which traffic gradually resumed on the Shahbagh-Matsya Bhaban, Shahbagh-Karwan Bazar, and Shahbagh-Science Lab roads, which had remained blocked during the protest. Some demonstrators were also seen hurling shoes at an effigy bearing the photograph of Law Adviser Asif Nazrul during the rally. Fatima Tasnim Juma, member secretary of the Dhaka University unit of Inqilab Mancha and secretary of the Liberation War and Democratic Movement of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, called on people to join the protest. “Everyone come to Shahbagh,” she wrote in a Facebook post following Hadi’s funeral. For security reasons, law enforcement agencies barricaded the road from Hotel InterContinental Dhaka towards Minto Road. A large contingent of police, APBn, and Border Guard Bangladesh personnel was deployed in the area, while water cannons and armoured personnel carriers were also positioned at the site. Earlier in the day, Sharif Osman Hadi was laid to rest beside the grave of national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on the Dhaka University campus after his namaz-e-janaza was held at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad under tight security. From the morning, mourners had gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in small processions to attend the funeral prayer, which was joined by a large crowd.Hadi’s death has sparked protests in Dhaka and several other districts since Thursday night, with demonstrators continuing to demand justice for him.",

        "body": "Students at Rajshahi University on Friday continued their demonstrations for the second consecutive day running against the authorities’ decision to reinstate the ward quota for the children of the university’s teachers, officials and employees for admission to undergraduate courses. After the Jumma prayers, they brought out a procession from the central mosque and later joined a rally in front of the graveyard of martyred Professor Dr Shamsuzzoha. Protesters at the rally said that the ward quota was a settled issue and must not be brought back ‘under any name or form’. Salahuddin Ammar, a former coordinator of the Student Against Discrimination, said that with the university central students’ union elections a few days ahead, a section of the university’s teaching and other staff was trying to bring the ward quota back using the elections as cover. ‘We are making it clear that RUCSU elections will be held, but the ward quota will never rise from the grave,’ he said. Law and land administration student Kamrul Hasan, alleging that the university authorities did not want the RUCSU election, said, ‘That is why they have reinstated the ward quota just days before the polls scheduled for September 25’. Mass communication and journalism student Mahir Faisal said threatened to launch a fierce movement against the ward quota reinstatement just as they did to oust the fascist Awami League regime. ‘If necessary, we are ready to give our blood again. But we will never allow anyone to bring back the ward quota,’ he warned. Earlier in the day, vice-chancellor Professor Saleh Hasan Naqib told journalists after Jumma prayers that the announcement by teachers, officers and employees of a work abstention from September 21 had raised concerns about the polls. ‘That is why the academic council sub-committee on admission made this decision,’ he said, adding, ‘But ultimately, what students want will prevail, because we want a peaceful university’. On January 2, the university administration abolished the ward quota facility for undergraduate admission enjoyed by the children and grandchildren of teachers, officers and other employees of the university. The administration cancelled the quota after students confined the vice-chancellor, pro-vice-chancellors and other officials inside the administration building for 12 hours on January 2, demanding its cancellation. Previously, a 5 per cent quota was reserved for the children and grandchildren of the RU teachers, officers and other employees for taking admission to the university’s undergraduate courses. But in early August, a section of teachers, officers and employees launched a movement demanding reinstatement of the facility. They also announced that from September 21 they would go for a full work abstention programme under which academic and administrative activities would also be boycotted if their demand was not met. Following their announcement, the authorities reinstated the ward quota on Thursday night, triggering protests from the students who took position in front of the vice-chancellor’s residence and staged a sit-in there for five hours at night.",

        "body": "Journalists held protest rallies across the country on Saturday to press their 39-point demand, including the implementation of the ‘No Wage Board, No Media’ policy, the formulation of a journalist protection law, the introduction of two-day weekly holidays, and the repeal of all anti-media black laws. The journalists organised the protest rallies under the banner of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists to ensure press freedom and journalists’ welfare. BFUJ faction secretary general Kader Gani Chowdhury presented the 39-point demand at a rally in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka. The BFUJ wants a transformed media environment where journalists can report freely, without fear, and pursue truth with responsibility as the driving force of journalism, Kader Gani said. The nationwide protests reflect journalists’ unity in defending their professional rights and press freedom, he added. Dhaka Union of Journalists’ president Shahidul Islam presided over the rally, while Jatiya Press Club president Hasan Hafiz, BFUJ faction acting president Obaidur Rahman Shahin, DUJ faction general secretary Khurshid Alam, among others, also spoke. The key demands also include immediate implementation of the ninth wage board award and formation of the 10th wage board, along with a unified wage board for print, electronic, online, and multimedia journalists, the establishment of a separate labour court for journalists, ending harassment, intimidation, and killings of journalists, with speedy trials for all murder cases, including journalist couple Sagar-Runi murder case. The demands also include the abolition of all anti-media laws, a guarantee for editorial and institutional independence of media houses, fair wages for district correspondents, safeguards against arbitrary dismissal, mandatory written appointment letters, timely payment of salaries, and accident and health insurance for media workers. The protest rallies were also held in Chattogram, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barishal, Khulna, Gazipur, Mymensingh and Narayanganj.",

        "body": "City dwellers suffered for at least three and a half hours until 6:00pm on Sunday as different groups staged separate street protests and a road blockade in front of the Jatiya Press Club and its adjoining areas in the capital, mainly to press home their job-related demands, leading to huge traffic congestion in the area. Several groups, including the Independent Ebtedayee Madrasah Teachers’ Union, the teachers of schools for students with disabilities, and the United Non-MPO Unity Council began separate sit-in demonstrations near the press club in the morning. Traffic congestion began in the area at about 2:30pm when several thousand teachers, under the platform of the Independent Ebtedayee Madrassah Teachers’ Union, brought out a march towards the chief adviser’s residence Jamuna, and were intercepted by the police at Kadam Foara, after marching a few yards. Sunday was the 21st day of the continuous sit-in programme of the ebtedayee madrassah teachers in the National Press Club area. After facing the police barricade, the protesting madrassah teachers sat down, which ultimately blocked one side of the road. They have been demanding the immediate implementation of the government’s January 28 announcement that all approved independent ebtedayee madrasahs would be nationalised. Due to the blockade, traffic movement became standstill on both ends of the blockade point. As time passed, traffic congestion spread to the nearby areas, which affected several other areas, including Matshyabhaba, Shahbagh, Banglamotor, Paltan, Bijoy Sarani, Naya Paltan, Mouchak, Gulistan, and some other parts of Old Dhaka. The platform’s chairman, Mokhlesur Rahman, said that they withdrew their blockade from the road at about 6:00pm after a fruitful meeting with the education ministry officials. He, however, said that they would continue their movement until their demand was met. Meanwhile, several thousand teachers under the United Non-MPO Unity Council also staged a sit-in in front of the Press Club, demanding that the government bring all approved non-MPO educational institutions under MPO facilities. They also brought out a procession in the afternoon. The procession paraded nearby roads. Teachers and staff members of schools for disabled students, on the other hand, held a march towards the Bangladesh Secretariat in the afternoon, demanding recognition of their institutions and declaration of monthly pay order for them. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s deputy commissioner for media and public relations, Talebur Rahman, in a press release, said that simultaneous street protests by several groups disrupted traffic at different places in the capital. ‘These (the street protests) have disrupted traffic on several important roads, causing widespread public suffering and severe traffic congestion in some parts of the capital,’ he said. The police said that traffic movement became normal after 6:00pm.",

        "body": "Anti-government protesters in Madagascar called on Wednesday for fresh demonstrations and a general strike, seeking to force president Andry Rajoelina to step down, after nearly a week of action by the youth-led movement. A crowd of several thousand people marched at midday (0900 GMT) in the northern city of Antsiranana, calling for the president to resign, a local source said. Police had cordoned off the centre of the capital Antananarivo, AFP journalists saw, although life had mostly returned to normal in the rest of the city. Near daily protests began in Antananarivo on Thursday and spread to other cities across the Indian Ocean nation of almost 32 million people. Despite Rajoelina sacking his government on Monday in a bid to quell the unrest, anger over misgovernance and water and power cuts was intensified by a heavy crackdown on protesters, which has left at least 22 dead and more than a hundred injured, according to the UN. The government has rejected the tally as unverified and ‘based on rumours or misinformation’. ‘The dismissal of the government is not enough for us,’ a spokesperson for the ‘Gen Z’ movement leading the protests said Tuesday. ‘We demand the resignation of the president and the cleaning up of the National Assembly,’ said the protester, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Another anonymous demonstrator said that ‘living conditions of the Malagasy people are deteriorating and getting worse every day’. Rajoelina ‘has been in power for 16 years, but nothing has changed’, he said. Rajoelina, 51, first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, which ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election due to international pressure, Rajoelina was voted back into office in 2018 and re-elected in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition. More than 10,000 people demonstrated and clashed with police in central Antananarivo Tuesday, according to a security source, where protesters were once again called to convene on Wednesday. On social media, the Gen Z movement called for the dissolution of the Senate, the Constitutional Court and the electoral commission, as well as for businessman Mamy Ravatomanga, reportedly Rajoelina’s main financial backer, to be put on trial. ‘Trade unions from the public sector are called to join a general strike,’ the movement said. Pope Leon XIV on Wednesday said he was ‘saddened by the news coming from Madagascar’ and called for ‘the promotion of justice and the common good’. Madagascar has seen a series of political crises since its independence from France in 1960. The country ranks among the world’s poorest but is the leading producer of vanilla and has natural resources in farming, forestry, fishing and minerals.",

An identified circle is behind it as part of its evil design. \"This identified circle is repeating such incident as no action was taken against the attackers in the past which led journalists and newspaper offices to a state of insecurity,\" they said. The Daily Azadi, the oldest Bengali daily in Chittagong came under bomb attack by a band of miscreants last night. The journalists leaders urged the government to take effective steps to ensure freedom of the press and security of the journalists.
