        "body": "Two new political parties, the National Citizen Party and the Bangladesh Jatiya League, are set to receive preliminary registration from the Election Commission after meeting all required conditions, senior secretary Akhtar Ahmed said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters at the EC headquarters in Agargaon in Dhaka city, Akhtar Ahmed said that the commission received applications from 143 political parties when it invited registration requests. ‘At the initial stage, we shortlisted 22 parties for further scrutiny, which was based on field-level information and detailed review. Following this process, two parties have met the preliminary requirements,’ he said. ‘We will now publish a notice in the newspapers at this stage regarding these parties to see if there are any objections concerning them,’ the EC secretary said. Regarding the NCP, Akhter Ahmed said that the symbol of the party was not yet specified as their requested party symbol was not listed in the official symbol regulations. ‘As the symbol is not yet specified, we will issue a letter to confirm the symbol they wish to use. Once we receive their response, we will publish a notification naming their approved symbol,’ he explained. Regarding the Bangladesh Jatiya League, their proposed symbol was fully compliant and there were no issues, although he did not disclose the symbol itself. The commission secretary also confirmed that the Bangladesh Nezam Islam Party was eligible for registration following a favourable court ruling. Akhter Ahmed said that several other parties, including Bangladesh Aam Janogan Party, Jatiya Janata Party, and the National Socialist Party (JASAD, Shahjahan Siraj faction) would require additional review at both the secretariat and field levels,. He said that the commission was also considering nine more parties for verification: the Aam Janata Party, Bangladesh Ganatantrik Party, Bangladesh Socialist Party (Marxist), Bangladesh Justice and Development Party, Bhasani Janashakti Party, Bangladesh Bekar Mukti Parishad, Janatar Dal, Moulik Bangla, and Janata Party Bangladesh. The EC secretary, however, said that seven parties had failed to provide sufficient documentation and that their applications would be rejected. These are: Forward Party, Bangladesh Communist Party (Marxist-CPBM), Bangladesh Reformist Party (BRP), Bangladesh Bekar Samaj, Bangladesh Solution Party, Natun Bangladesh Party, and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and Nezam-e-Islami Party. At present, 51 political parties, including the Bangladesh Awami League, are registered with the Election Commission. Awami League’s registration has recently been suspended as the government imposed ban on the activities of the party.",

The gala hockey tournament was held in Madurai of India. Hamza Choudhury, who is a England-born Bangladesh origin footballer showed a spectacular performance in AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Hamza powered his Bangladesh team to defeat stronger India 1-0 in their home match. After 12 years, Bangladesh beat India in any international football meet. Hamza, who has played Leicestershire FC in English Premier League, played for Bangladesh and his performance regained the popularity of Bangladesh’s football. Thus, Hamza Choudhury is a legend of Bangladesh’s football. Amirul’s marvelous performance is remarkable for the Bangladesh Youth Hockey team. Thus, Amirul is called ‘Hamza of Bangladesh’s Hockey’. Bangladesh Junior Hockey team was billed in Pool-F with France, Australia and South Korea. Bangladesh suffered a 3-5 goals defeat to Australia on November 29. But Amirul fought back alone and hit a hat-trick. Bangladesh made a 3-3 goals draw with South Korea on November 30. Amirul played the key role to hold South Korea. Amirul hit a hat-trick against South Korea and powered his team to make a draw with South Korea. Bangladesh tasted a 2-3 goals defeat to France on December 2. Amirul scored a goal for his team.

But we drew the match with South Korea in the group stage. If we had won, we might have had a chance.” Amirul also said, “I thought we would have won against Australia and France too, but we didn’t due to lack of experience. These goals are not mine alone, my teammates also contributed to this. I want to thank them and the coaching staff. My teammates especially supported me a lot. There were players in the team who were more skilled than me, but they gave me a chance. Everyone believed that I could convert penalty corners into goals. But this is my strength. Before every match, I talk to the coach. I also analyse myself personally.” “I played in the World Cup for the junior team. I dream of playing in the World Cup for the senior team one day. For that, I have to prepare myself better, and I will try to do that in the future”, he added.",

        "body": "Tensions mounted near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Tuesday as hundreds of activists from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) clashed with police during a protest over the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh. Carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans, the protesters broke through multiple police barricades, forcing security personnel to struggle to contain the crowd in the high-security diplomatic zone, according to Indian media, including PTI and ANI. Police had earlier stepped up security in the area in anticipation of the demonstration announced by Hindu right-wing groups, citing concerns over the death of a Hindu youth in a lynch-mob attack in Bangladesh. Besides, hundreds of protesters attempted to march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata but were stopped by police. The march, titled ‘Hindu Hunkar Padayatra’, was organised under the banner of Bongiyo Hindu Jagaran, reports PTI. The procession began from Sealdah and was heading towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission when police intercepted it in the Beckbagan area. Police set up barricades to prevent the protesters from advancing, witnesses said. A large contingent of police personnel was deployed in and around the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission office to maintain law and order amid the protest. Dipu Chandra Das, 28, a garment worker, was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Bhaluka Upazila of Mymensingh district December 18 and his body was later set on fire. Bangladesh on Tuesday expressed grave concern to the government of India over incidents involving extremist elements, including disturbances outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the official residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma and expressed deep concern over violent protests staged outside the premises of the different Diplomatic Missions of Bangladesh in India. Bangladesh condemned such acts of premeditated violence or intimidation against diplomatic establishments, which not only endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance. The government of Bangladesh called upon the government of India to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents, to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts and to ensure safety and security of Bangladesh’s diplomatic missions and related facilities in India. The government of Bangladesh expects the government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

        "title": "Bangladesh find positives despite failing to qualify",
        "body": "Bangladesh’s hopes of qualifying for the AFC Asian Cup 2027 were practically over following India’s loss to Singapore and Bangladesh’s draw against Hong Kong in their respective two Group C qualifying games on Tuesday. Despite failing to qualify for the Asia Cup, Bangladesh can take away some positives from their qualifier campaign, as they fought hard in each game, forcing Hong Kong to play ultra-defensive for at least 20 minutes on Tuesday. At the Kai Tak Stadium, captain Matthew Orr gave Hong Kong the lead in the 36th minute with a penalty before Rakib Hossain restored the parity six minutes from the stipulated time for Bangladesh. On the other hand, Singapore earned a comeback win following a brace from midfielder Song Ui-young (44th, 58th) after midfielder Lallianzuala Chhangte (14th) gave India the lead. As only the group champions from the 24-team qualifiers will advance to the final stage, both Bangladesh and India were out of the top place race after Tuesday’s outcome. Even though Bangladesh and India both have two points from four games, the former is in third place in the table with a better goal difference. Bangladesh earlier played a goalless draw away to India before losing to Singapore 2-1 and 4-3 against Hong Kong at home. Spanish coach Javier Cabrera’s charges will host India on November 18 before facing Singapore away on March 31, 2026. But neither Bangladesh nor India have any chances even if they win their remaining two games, as top-placed Hong Kong and second-placed Singapore have eight points each from their four outings. They also have two games to play. Bangladesh’s fighting spirit was seen very much visible during their home game against Hong Kong as well. In the match, Bangladesh took the lead with Hamza Choudhury’s 13th-minute free kick but went 3-1 down within the 75th. They fought hard to make a comeback and tied the game 3-3 with goals from Shekh Morsalin (84th) and Shamit Shome in injury time, but the jubilation lasted only two minutes until hat-trick hero Raphael Merkies broke Bangladesh’s hearts with a last-gasp strike in the seven-goal thriller. Bangladesh also made a comeback against Singapore as Rakib scored in the 67th minute after Song Ui-young (45th) and Ikhsan Ahmed (58th) scored once each for their side. Despite widespread criticism of Cabrera’s team selections, which include never calling custodian Anisur Rahman Zico to the final squad since November 2024, there is no disputing that Bangladesh’s fighting spirit has matured since Leicester City midfielder Hamza began representing Bangladesh. Hamza’s debut for Bangladesh against India in March of this year encouraged three other overseas players to join the team: Shamit Shom from Canada, Fahamedul Islam from Italy, and Zayyan Ahmed from the United States. Their addition to the national squad brought the total number of foreign Bangladeshi players to six, including Jamal Bhuyan and Tariq Kazi from Denmark and Finland, respectively.",

        "title": "Normal security not ensured at Delhi mission, says Touhid",
        "body": "Bangladesh foreign minister Md Touhid Hossain on Sunday said that ‘normal security’ was not maintained at the Bangladesh mission in India and the high commissioner, who was staying there with his family, felt threatened. Rejecting India’s press statement on Saturday’s demonstration in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, he said that Bangladesh would rely on the host country for the security and expected that the incident in Delhi would not be repeated in the future. ‘We completely reject the press note. How come a group of Hindu militants were allowed to move to that area -- much inside the diplomatic enclave? They were not supposed to be allowed there. They have said many things,’ said Touhid responding to reporters’ questions at his ministry. ‘We have come to know that the demonstrators threatened to kill the high commissioner although we don’t have any evidence,’ said Touhid. He said that Dhaka hoped that the Indian government would take necessary steps to enhance the security of the diplomatic mission. The foreign affairs ministry later in a press release said that the ‘unjustifiable incident’ at the Bangladesh high commission residence in New Delhi was highly regrettable and could not be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’. Bangladesh has, however, noted the commitment of the government of India to ensure the safety and security of all Bangladesh diplomatic posts in India. Responding to media queries on the reported demonstration in front of the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi on December 20, 2025, India’s external affairs ministry Randhir Jaiswal on Sunday in a statement said that there was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. He further said that India was committed to ensure safety of foreign missions in its territory. ‘We have noted misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident. The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi on 20 December and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,’ he said. Jaiswal said that the police stationed on the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes. ‘Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,’ he added. India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh, according to the statement. ‘Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,’ Jaiswal said. About the lynching of the youth in Mymensingh, the Bangladesh foreign adviser said that the murder of an individual was not an issue of minority and it might happen anywhere. The victim was a Bangladeshi citizen and the important thing was that prompt actions were under way in the case, he mentioned. The government of Bangladesh has promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident, the foreign ministry release said. ‘The inter-communal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia. Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,’ it mentioned.",

        "body": "Bangladesh and Japan have finalised the draft of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), with the deal set to be signed next month, Commerce Adviser Sk Bashir Uddin said on Monday. “I talked to the Japanese Foreign Minister over the phone today (Monday). The EPA will be signed next month,” he said at a press conference on Bangladesh-Japan EPA negotiations at the Secretariat. Bangladesh will enjoy immediate duty-free access to the Japanese market for 7,379 products once the Bangladesh-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is signed, marking a major boost for the country’s export sector. Japan will also enjoy duty-free access for 1,039 products under the agreement. The announcement was made by Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashir Uddin following a telephone conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu, during which the successful conclusion of the EPA negotiations was confirmed. According to a statement issued by the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing on Monday:Key highlights of the agreement is the inclusion of Bangladesh’s major export items particularly readymade garments (RMG) which will receive duty-free access to the Japanese market from the very first day the EPA comes into effect. The EPA also includes strong commitments in the Trade in Services sector. Under the deal, Bangladesh has agreed to open 97 sub-sectors to Japan, while Japan will open 120 sub-sectors to Bangladesh across four modes of supply. Officials believe this will encourage greater Japanese investment in Bangladesh, alongside enhanced technology transfer, skills development and service-sector collaboration. Japan is currently the world’s fourth-largest economy, and the conclusion of the EPA negotiations at the negotiator level marks a major milestone in bilateral economic relations. Legal scrubbing and final approvals are still pending before the agreement is officially signed. The government expects the EPA to deliver wide-ranging economic benefits for Bangladesh, including expanded trade, increased foreign direct investment, and new employment opportunities. Officials described the agreement as the beginning of a new chapter in Bangladesh-Japan economic cooperation. Those present at the announcement included the Chief Adviser’s Special Envoy on International Affairs Lutfey Siddiqi, Bangladesh Investment Development Authority Executive Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, Chief Negotiator Ayesha Akter, Deputy Chief Negotiator Md Firoj Uddin Ahmed, and Focal Point Mahbuba Khatoon Minu. As a Least Developed Country (LDC), Bangladesh will, for the first time, sign an EPA with Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy. The signing of this agreement is expected to bring far-reaching trade and economic benefits for Bangladesh, including enhanced trade, investment, and employment opportunities, marking a new chapter in the nation’s economic relations with Japan. “This marks the conclusion of negotiations at the negotiator level. Further steps will involve legal scrubbing and further approvals from advisory council/cabinet on both sides,” the release said.",

        "body": "Tensions mounted near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Tuesday as hundreds of activists from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) clashed with police during a protest over the lynching of a Hindu man in Bangladesh. Carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans, the protesters broke through multiple police barricades, forcing security personnel to struggle to contain the crowd in the high-security diplomatic zone, according to Indian media, including PTI and ANI. Police had earlier stepped up security in the area in anticipation of the demonstration announced by Hindu right-wing groups, citing concerns over the death of a Hindu youth in a lynch-mob attack in Bangladesh. Besides, hundreds of protesters attempted to march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata but were stopped by police. The march, titled ‘Hindu Hunkar Padayatra’, was organised under the banner of Bongiyo Hindu Jagaran, reports PTI. The procession began from Sealdah and was heading towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission when police intercepted it in the Beckbagan area. Police set up barricades to prevent the protesters from advancing, witnesses said. A large contingent of police personnel was deployed in and around the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission office to maintain law and order amid the protest. Dipu Chandra Das, 28, a garment worker, was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Bhaluka Upazila of Mymensingh district December 18 and his body was later set on fire. Bangladesh on Tuesday expressed grave concern to the government of India over incidents involving extremist elements, including disturbances outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the official residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma and expressed deep concern over violent protests staged outside the premises of the different Diplomatic Missions of Bangladesh in India. Bangladesh condemned such acts of premeditated violence or intimidation against diplomatic establishments, which not only endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance. The government of Bangladesh called upon the government of India to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents, to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts and to ensure safety and security of Bangladesh’s diplomatic missions and related facilities in India. The government of Bangladesh expects the government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",

        "body": "The Yonex-Sunrise Bangladesh International Challenge continued on Wednesday , the second day of the tournament, with Bangladesh’s shuttlers enduring another difficult outing, particularly in the singles events. After a mixed start in the qualification round on the opening day, hopes of a turnaround faded quickly as most of the home players bowed out early. In both men’s and women’s singles, Akib Sulaiman and Shuvo Khandakar, who had won their opening matches, suffered defeats in their second outings. Experienced national shuttlers such as Aiman Ibne Jaman and Al-Amin Jumar also failed to advance, while Nasima Khatun, despite winning her first match, could not carry the momentum into the next round. The trend continued on Wednesday morning as national champion Khandakar Abdus Sowad was also eliminated. Amid the gloom, Gaurab Singh stood tall as Bangladesh’s sole remaining contender in the singles draw. The three-time national champion from Sylhet secured his place in the last 32 with a convincing straight-games win over Australia’s Pushkal Iru Sumalla, winning 21-12, 21-12 with authority. After the match, Gaurab with smile, said, “I am very happy to have won today. The international level is very high, and you never know who will play well on a given day.” “One wins, another loses. I played well today, and that made the difference,” he added.Reflecting on his improvement, Gaurab revealed that he had undergone three months of intensive training ahead of the SAFF Games. “I stayed disciplined, trained under a foreign coach and worked on playing at full speed. Earlier, I used to struggle after 16 or 17 points, but I have worked hard to improve that,” he added. Gaurab also downplayed the importance of rankings in international competition. “Here, everyone is good and mostly unfamiliar. All opponents are new. Winning one round makes me feel better, and this victory will motivate me in the next matches. I will also play doubles today and try to do well. I want to be the best for the spectators and make my country proud,” he said. Bangladesh’s struggles extended to the doubles events as well. Brothers Sifat Ullah Galib and Mohammad Sibgat Ullah were knocked out by their Vietnamese opponents, losing in straight games 21-15, 21-12, as the popular Chattogram pair failed to find their rhythm.As the tournament progresses, all eyes will now be on Gaurab Singh to carry Bangladesh’s hopes forward in the singles draw.",

        "title": "Australia’s Tobacco tax and regulatory missteps hold warnings for Bangladesh",
        "body": "Bangladesh’s Interim Government risks forfeiting substantial government revenueand instead triggering acceleration of the illicit tobacco market if it proceeds with its proposed draconian tobacco control measures. Plans to ban ingredients, mandate retailer licenses, and alternative smokeless nicotine products such as vapour and nicotine pouches, coupled withdrastic excise increases above WHO target rates as seen in January 2025, do not necessarily translate into a reduction in tobacco consumption as seen in other countries, but instead threaten to fuelillicit trade for cigarettes. Tobacco taxes currently contribute roughly 10% of Bangladesh’s entire government revenue, making the tobacco sector one of the biggest fiscal contributors of the country.With financial pressures intensifying and enforcement resources stretched thin, the government has little room for error. Bangladesh’s currenttobacco tax rate stands at 83% of the retail price for the whole market, which exceeds the World Health Organization’s recommended benchmark of 75%. While the tobacco sector in Bangladesh had traditionally delivered an annual government revenue growth of 12-15% in the past, excluding the year impacted by Covid, early signs [afterthe unexpected excise hike was implemented]showed thatthis year’s tobacco revenue has witnessed a growth of mere 5%. Australia’s recent experience highlights how quickly tough tobacco regulations can disrupt the industry, driving rapid changes in both market dynamics and consumer behavior. Over the past decade, Australia has paired some of the world’s highest excise taxes—now at AUD 1.5 per cigarette—with strict controls such as flavor bans and a de facto ban on retail vapor sales. These aggressive measures have produced striking and far-reaching consequences for the industry, with results that have been truly alarming. Revenue collapsed. Tobacco excise revenue peaked at AUD 16.3 billion in 2019–20, before falling to AUD 7.8 billion in 2024-25, a loss of nearly AUD 9 billion. Independent economist Chris Richardson estimates the true annual loss may be closer to AUD 10 billion, arguing the scale of decline far exceeds what could plausibly be explained by quitting alone. Illicit markets surged. Official data from the Australian Illicit Tobacco and E-cigarette Commissioner estimates that 50–60% of all tobacco consumption is now illicit. In vapour, 95% of the total market is illicit and operates outside regulatory and health controls. Criminal networks are estimated to earn AUD 5.7–8.5 billion a year from illicit tobacco and vapes combined, while evaded excise and customs duty range from AUD 7.7–11.8 billion annually. Public health gains proved uneven. After Australia banned non-therapeutic vapes in July 2024, overall nicotine use rose for the first time in years . Survey data show the increase was driven mainly by factory-made cigarettes, primarily driven by increased smoking rateamong 18–24-year-olds. Australia is a G20 and OECD country with strong regulatory institutions and, as an island, has robust border controls. Yet even there, authorities have struggled to regain control of the tobacco and vapourmarket. For Bangladesh, the risks are magnified. We cannot afford to misstep with poorly thought-outregulations which will only drive an already growing illicit market and reduce government revenue. The former Head of the Australian Border Force’s Illicit Tobacco Strike Team, Rohan Pike who also led Australia’s law enforcement efforts in Pakistan and 12 neighbouring countries for 3 years stated“Australian tobacco control policies should serve as a cautionary tale for Bangladesh and other countries considering tobacco tax rises and additional regulation. Excessive excise hikes have reduced government revenue to less than half in just 6 years and driven an exploding black market that now makes up about two-thirds of the tobacco market. Bans on flavoured cigarettes have only accelerated the shift over to the black market and virtual bans on vapes and other nicotine products have made the far more dangerous, cheap, illegal cigarettes increasingly popular, reversing decades of smoking rate reductions. The Bangladesh government cannot afford to make the same mistakes as Australia.” A leading Bangladeshi expert in public finance has cautioned that adopting similar policies could lead to severe and unintended consequences. “Bangladesh relies more heavily on tobacco revenue than Australia, but has far fewer enforcement tools,” said Farid Uddin, former NBR Member. “If regulation moves faster than capacity and becomes impossible to implement and enforce, the state risks losing revenue, credibility, and control of the market at the same time. Hence, regulations have to be realistic and time bound. Critics contend that the bill should be reconsidered and brought before Parliament after the February 2026 election, ensuring that elected representatives can thoughtfully balance public health objectives with fiscal stability and enforcement realities. Australia’s experience demonstrates that, without proportionate enforcement, aggressive tobacco controls may inadvertently weaken the state rather than strengthen it.",

        "body": "National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener Md Nahid Islam today said the people of Bangladesh would unite on Victory Day tomorrow against the Indian hegemony and all conspiracies targeting the country. “On Victory Day tomorrow, we will not take to the streets for celebration. We will take to the streets for resistance. In Dhaka and across Bangladesh, we will hold resistance rallies against Indian hegemony and all anti-Bangladesh conspiracies,” he added. Nahid was addressing the all-party resistance rally protesting the attempted killing of Osman Hadi, organised by Inqilab Mancha at the Central Shaheed Minar this afternoon. The NCP Convener said December 16 symbolises not only victory but also the beginning of a long journey of resistance. “Just as we achieved victory on December 16, 1971, our journey of resistance also began that day. That resistance was against Indian aggression, and it has continued to this day,” he said. He said if India believed it could continue political interference in Bangladesh after August 5, including manipulating elections, “that assumption is wrong and will be proven wrong”. Referring to the shooting of Osman Hadi, Nahid said the attack was not an isolated incident. “With the bullet hitting Osman Hadi, the July Revolution has been attacked. Every time Bangladesh is attacked, its youth rise in resistance,” he said. In this connection, he said that the rally carried a clear message that Bangladesh and the forces of the July Revolution remain united. Nahid also questioned the moral legitimacy of the Chief Election Commissioner following his recent remarks. “After such statements, he has no moral right to remain in office. Whether a free and fair election is possible under him is a question before the nation,” he said and expressed the hope that the statement would be withdrawn immediately. Nahid said calls had been raised for the resignation of the home adviser, arguing that he had lost moral authority to remain in office. “Since August 5, the law and order situation has not returned to normalcy. Participants of the July uprising have been targeted, martyr families harassed, and justice has not been ensured,” Nahid said. The rally, which began at 3:00 pm, was attended by leaders and activists of various political, social and cultural organisations.

        "body": "ক্ষমতাচ্যুত আওয়ামী লীগ সরকারের সময়ে ব্যবসা করতে গিয়ে সমস্যায় পড়েছে বা মার্কিন ডলারের মূল্যবৃদ্ধির কারণে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়েছে, এমন ব্যবসাপ্রতিষ্ঠান চালু ও চাঙা করার উদ্যোগ নিয়েছে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক। নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থাটি ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত ব্যবসাপ্রতিষ্ঠানগুলোক ২ শতাংশ অর্থ জমা দিয়ে খেলাপি ঋণ নিয়মিত করার সুযোগ দিয়েছে। এই ঋণের মেয়াদ হবে সর্বোচ্চ ১০ বছর। ঋণ নিয়মিত হলে শুরুতে দুই বছর ঋণ পরিশোধে বিরতি সুবিধা পাওয়া যাবে। এ সুবিধা পেতে চাইলে চলতি বছরের ৩১ ডিসেম্বরের মধ্যে সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংকে আবেদন করতে হবে। খেলাপি ব্যবসায়ীদের ঋণ পুনঃ তফসিল করার সুবিধা দিয়ে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের ব্যাংকিং প্রবিধি ও নীতি বিভাগ গতকাল মঙ্গলবার একটি প্রজ্ঞাপন জারি করেছে। এতে বলা হয়েছে, ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানের কাছ থেকে ঋণ পুনঃ তফসিলের আবেদন পাওয়ার পর ছয় মাসের মধ্যে ব্যাংককে তা নিষ্পত্তি করতে হবে। ঋণ পুনঃ তফসিলের বিষয়ে সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংকের পরিচালনা পর্ষদ চূড়ান্ত সিদ্ধান্ত নেবে। একইভাবে এককালীন ঋণ পরিশোধ করা যাবে। এ ক্ষেত্রে এক বছর সময় পাবেন গ্রাহকেরা। এ জন্য বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক থেকে কোনো অনাপত্তি নেওয়ার প্রয়োজন হবে না। এর ফলে আওয়ামী লীগ সরকারের সময়ে যেসব ব্যবসায়ী চাপে ছিলেন এবং বিএনপি ও জামায়াতের রাজনীতির সঙ্গে যুক্ত, তাঁরা সুবিধা পাবেন বলে আশা করা হচ্ছে। দেশে গত জুন মাসের শেষে খেলাপি ঋণ বেড়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে ৫ লাখ ৩০ হাজার ৪২৮ কোটি টাকা, যা বিতরণ করা মোট ঋণের ২৭ দশমিক শূন্য ৯ শতাংশ। দেশে এক বছরে খেলাপি ঋণ বেড়েছে তিন লাখ কোটি টাকার বেশি। ঋণ নিয়মিত করার সুবিধা দেওয়ার মূল উদ্দেশ্য হিসেবে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক বলেছে, গত বছরের আগস্টে রাজনৈতিক পটপরিবর্তনের আগে বিনিয়োগ ও কর্মসংস্থান সৃষ্টিকারী অনেক ঋণগ্রহীতা প্রতিষ্ঠান নিয়ন্ত্রণবহির্ভূত কারণে স্বাভাবিক ব্যবসায়িক কার্যক্রম পরিচালনায় প্রতিবন্ধকতার শিকার হয়। এতে ঋণ বা ঋণের কিস্তি পরিশোধে প্রতিকূলতার সম্মুখীন হয় প্রতিষ্ঠানগুলো। তাদের কেউ কেউ ঋণসংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংকিং ও আনুষঙ্গিক সেবাপ্রাপ্তির ক্ষেত্রে অব্যবসায়িক দৃষ্টিভঙ্গির শিকার হয়ে স্বাভাবিক ব্যবসায়িক কর্মকাণ্ড চালাতে পারেনি। এতে তারা খেলাপি হয়ে পড়ে। অন্যদিকে ব্যাংকের ঋণ আদায় কার্যক্রমে বিরূপ প্রভাব পড়ে, যা সামগ্রিকভাবে দেশের অর্থনীতি ও ব্যাংক খাতের আর্থিক কাঠামোকে ঝুঁকির সম্মুখীন করেছে। এমন প্রেক্ষাপটে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত প্রতিষ্ঠানের পুনর্গঠন, ব্যাংক খাতে কাঙ্ক্ষিত গতি ফিরিয়ে আনা এবং দেশের অর্থনৈতিক কর্মকাণ্ডে গতিশীলতা ফেরাতে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক বিভিন্ন উদ্যোগ নেয়। বিভিন্ন কারণে বৈশ্বিক সরবরাহ ব্যবস্থায় বিঘ্ন থেকে সৃষ্ট অভিঘাত ও বৈদেশিক মুদ্রার বিপরীতে দেশি টাকার বিনিময় হার অপ্রত্যাশিতভাবে কমে যাওয়ার কারণে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হওয়া প্রতিষ্ঠানও এই সুবিধার জন্য আবেদন করার যোগ্য হবে। ইতিপূর্বে ঋণ পুনঃ তফসিল ও পুনর্গঠন ইত্যাদি সুবিধা যেসব প্রতিষ্ঠান পায়নি, তাদের অগ্রাধিকারের ভিত্তিতে এই নীতি সহায়তা দেওয়া হবে। যেসব সুবিধা পাওয়া যাবে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংকের নতুন প্রজ্ঞাপনে বলা হয়েছে, ব্যাংকার ও গ্রাহক সম্পর্কের ভিত্তিতে চলতি বছরের ৩০ জুন পর্যন্ত বিদ্যমান খেলাপি ঋণের স্থিতির ওপর কমপক্ষে ২ শতাংশ নগদে অর্থ জমা দিতে হবে। তাতে ঋণ নিয়মিত হলে দুই বছরের গ্রেস পিরিয়ডসহ (ঋণ পরিশোধে বিরতি) তা পরিশোধে ১০ বছর সময় পাওয়া যাবে। তবে ইতিপূর্বে ঋণ তিন বা তার চেয়ে বেশিবার পুনঃ তফসিল করা হলে অতিরিক্ত ১ শতাংশ অর্থ জমা দিতে হবে। তবে পরবর্তী সময়ে ব্যাংকের নির্ধারিত ঋণ পরিশোধের সূচি অনুযায়ী তিনটি মাসিক কিস্তি বা একটি ত্রৈমাসিক কিস্তি পরিশোধে ব্যর্থ হলে সংশ্লিষ্ট প্রতিষ্ঠানকে খেলাপি হিসেবে চিহ্নিত করা হবে। প্রজ্ঞাপনে আরও বলা হয়েছে, আগে যেসব অর্থ জমা দেওয়া হয়েছে, তা ২ শতাংশ হিসেবে গণ্য হবে না। নতুন করে ২ শতাংশ অর্থ জমা দেওয়ার পর তা নগদায়ন হলে এরপর ছয় মাসের মধ্যে আবেদনটি নিষ্পত্তি করতে হবে। সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যাংককে প্রকৃত ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত ঋণগ্রহীতার ক্ষতির পরিমাণ ও প্রতিষ্ঠানের ঘুরে দাঁড়ানোর সম্ভাবনাকে যথাযথভাবে বিবেচনায় নিয়ে ঋণ পুনঃ তফসিল করতে নির্দেশনা দিয়েছে বাংলাদেশ ব্যাংক। নির্দেশনায় আরও বলা হয়েছে, এই সুবিধা দেওয়ার পর ৯০ দিনের মধ্যে ব্যাংক ও গ্রাহকের সোলেনামার মাধ্যমে ব্যাংক কর্তৃপক্ষকে চলমান মামলার কার্যক্রম স্থগিতের ব্যবস্থা নিতে হবে। কোনো গ্রাহক সুবিধার কোনো শর্ত ভাঙলে তাঁর পাওয়া সব সুবিধা বাতিল হবে। এমনকি ঋণ আদায়ে ব্যাংক প্রয়োজনীয় আইনি ব্যবস্থা নিতে পারবে। নির্দেশনা অনুযায়ী, ৩০০ কোটি বা তার বেশি ঋণের ক্ষেত্রে নীতি সহায়তা দেওয়ার বিষয়ে ব্যাংক সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে না পারলে পরিচালনা পর্ষদের অনুমোদন নিয়ে ব্যবসা ও আর্থিক ব্যবস্থাদি পুনর্গঠনের লক্ষ্যে গঠিত নীতি সহায়তাসংক্রান্ত বাছাই কমিটির কাছে আবেদন করতে হবে। জালজালিয়াতি বা অন্য কোনো প্রতারণা বা অনিয়মের মাধ্যমে নেওয়া ঋণ কিংবা ব্যাংক কর্তৃক চূড়ান্তভাবে ঘোষিত ইচ্ছাকৃত খেলাপি গ্রাহকেরা এই ঋণ সুবিধা পাবেন না। অ্যাসোসিয়েশন অব ব্যাংকার্স বাংলাদেশের (এবিবি) সাবেক চেয়ারম্যান আনিস এ খান প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, দেশের ভালো ব্যবসায়ীদের অনেকেই ভুগছেন। তাঁদের ঋণ খেলাপি হয়ে পড়েছে। কখন নির্বাচন হবে, এ জন্য অপেক্ষা করছেন। কেউ কেউ পালিয়েছেন, আবার কেউ জেলে আছেন। দেশের জিডিপি ও কর্মসংস্থানে ভূমিকা রাখতে পারেন, এমন ব্যবসায়ীদের জন্য এই সুবিধা প্রয়োজন ছিল। এতে তাঁরা ব্যবসায়ে ফিরতে পারবেন বা গতি বাড়াতে পারবেন। অনেক রাজনীতিবিদও এই সুবিধা পাবেন। সামনে নির্বাচন। এ জন্য সবাই ঋণ নিয়মিত করার চেষ্টা করবেন। তাঁরাও সুবিধাটি পাবেন। স্বাভাবিক সময়ে ব্যাংকের জন্য এত ছাড়ে ঋণ নিয়মিত করাটা চাপের হলেও এখনকার পরিস্থিতিতে ঠিক আছে।",

Carrying saffron flags and chanting slogans, the protesters broke through multiple police barricades, forcing security personnel to struggle to contain the crowd in the high-security diplomatic zone, according to Indian media, including PTI and ANI. Police had earlier stepped up security in the area in anticipation of the demonstration announced by Hindu right-wing groups, citing concerns over the death of a Hindu youth in a lynch-mob attack in Bangladesh. Besides, hundreds of protesters attempted to march towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Kolkata but were stopped by police. The march, titled ‘Hindu Hunkar Padayatra’, was organised under the banner of Bongiyo Hindu Jagaran, reports PTI. The procession began from Sealdah and was heading towards the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission when police intercepted it in the Beckbagan area. Police set up barricades to prevent the protesters from advancing, witnesses said. A large contingent of police personnel was deployed in and around the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission office to maintain law and order amid the protest. Dipu Chandra Das, 28, a garment worker, was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy in Bhaluka Upazila of Mymensingh district December 18 and his body was later set on fire. Bangladesh on Tuesday expressed grave concern to the government of India over incidents involving extremist elements, including disturbances outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the official residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Pranay Verma and expressed deep concern over violent protests staged outside the premises of the different Diplomatic Missions of Bangladesh in India. Bangladesh condemned such acts of premeditated violence or intimidation against diplomatic establishments, which not only endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance. The government of Bangladesh called upon the government of India to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents, to take all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts and to ensure safety and security of Bangladesh’s diplomatic missions and related facilities in India.

        "body": "The upward trend in remittances sent by Bangladesh expatriates has continued in December, with receiving over US $2.42 billion in 22 days of the month. Bangladesh received $15.46 billion inward remittance so far in the current fiscal year FY 2025-26. Blessings on the remittance, the gross forex reserves of Bangladesh increased to $32.72 billion on Monday (December 18). As per the IMF standard BPM6, the forex reserves stood $28.03 billion. Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr. Ahsan H. Mansur in a discussion meeting recently said that the forex reserves may cross $35 billion by this month. Arif Hossain Khan, Executive Director and spokesperson of Bangladesh Bank (BB) said the $2.42 billion remittance figure for December 1-22 is an increase by 11.6 percent compared to the same period last year. In December of the previous year (2024), the country received around $2.17 billion in 22 days. The growth is attributed to several factors, including incentives offered for sending money through legal banking channels, increased encouragement for using the formal system, and the active role of exchange houses. Remittance inflow has shown robust growth throughout the current fiscal year (FY 2025-26). From July 1 to December 22, 2025, the total remittance inflow reached $15.46billion. This represents an increase of $2.17 billion compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year (FY 2024-25), when the total stood at $13.31 billion. The year-on-year growth rate for the fiscal year to date is 16.2 percent.",

        "title": "Bangladesh Bank orders strict loan data updates to bar defaulters from election race",
        "body": "Bangladesh Bank has ordered all scheduled banks to promptly update loan repayment data as prospective lawmaker candidates, many of them business and political figures, scramble to clear defaults and overdue installments to remain eligible for the national polls. Managing directors of various banks, non-bank financial institutions, and Bangladesh Bank officials said they are receiving a surge in applications for loan regularisation. In response, the Credit Information Bureau of Bangladesh Bank has issued a strict directive to all banks and financial institutions nationwide, ordering rapid updates of loan-related data to confirm the financial eligibility of potential candidates. Bangladesh Bank officials said on Saturday that even if a borrower secures a stay order from a court, financial institutions must report the accurate status of the loan to the CIB without any alteration. The central bank emphasised that there will be no scope to conceal information or offer ‘arbitrary’ concessions. A special meeting was held on October 29 with CIB representatives from all banks and NBFIs, where institutions were informed of the government’s firm instruction to complete loan data updates before the election to ensure no loan defaulter can contest. ‘The Bangladesh Bank has made it clear that the government will not allow any loan defaulter to become a candidate in the upcoming election,’ said a CIB official. Arif Hossain Khan, executive director and spokesperson of Bangladesh Bank, said the central bank is updating customers’ loan statuses as per government instructions. He added that providing updated credit information to Bangladesh Bank is a routine responsibility of banks. The central bank has also directed all institutions to strictly follow existing rules concerning borrowers attempting to reschedule long-overdue defaulted loans ahead of the election. No exceptions, special privileges, or rule violations will be permitted for rescheduling. All financial institutions, particularly those yet to submit their default data to the CIB, have been ordered to do so immediately. Updated reports detailing the full status of all new and ongoing loans, based on month-end outstanding balances, are mandatory. Banks have been specifically instructed to update the following information: Accounts of ongoing and settled loans, along with accurate balances and classification status, Maturity dates and overdue balances, Number and value of defaulted instalments, and details of installment payments or recoveries. To ensure round-the-clock verification of loan information for potential candidates, Bangladesh Bank has directed every bank branch to appoint a dedicated officer. Their names and mobile numbers must be submitted to the central bank. Electoral law clearly states that a candidate will be disqualified if their bank loan status is not classified as ‘regular’ up to seven days before the submission of nomination papers. Officials concerned believe this rigorous initiative by Bangladesh Bank will play a decisive role in preventing loan defaulters from securing nominations ahead of the election.",

        "title": "Bangladesh to unite against Indian hegemony on Victory Day: Nahid",
        "body": "National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener Md Nahid Islam today said the people of Bangladesh would unite on Victory Day tomorrow against the Indian hegemony and all conspiracies targeting the country. “On Victory Day tomorrow, we will not take to the streets for celebration. We will take to the streets for resistance. In Dhaka and across Bangladesh, we will hold resistance rallies against Indian hegemony and all anti-Bangladesh conspiracies,” he added. Nahid was addressing the all-party resistance rally protesting the attempted killing of Osman Hadi, organised by Inqilab Mancha at the Central Shaheed Minar this afternoon. The NCP Convener said December 16 symbolises not only victory but also the beginning of a long journey of resistance. “Just as we achieved victory on December 16, 1971, our journey of resistance also began that day. That resistance was against Indian aggression, and it has continued to this day,” he said. He said if India believed it could continue political interference in Bangladesh after August 5, including manipulating elections, “that assumption is wrong and will be proven wrong”. Referring to the shooting of Osman Hadi, Nahid said the attack was not an isolated incident. “With the bullet hitting Osman Hadi, the July Revolution has been attacked. Every time Bangladesh is attacked, its youth rise in resistance,” he said. In this connection, he said that the rally carried a clear message that Bangladesh and the forces of the July Revolution remain united. Nahid also questioned the moral legitimacy of the Chief Election Commissioner following his recent remarks. “After such statements, he has no moral right to remain in office. Whether a free and fair election is possible under him is a question before the nation,” he said and expressed the hope that the statement would be withdrawn immediately. Nahid said calls had been raised for the resignation of the home adviser, arguing that he had lost moral authority to remain in office. “Since August 5, the law and order situation has not returned to normalcy. Participants of the July uprising have been targeted, martyr families harassed, and justice has not been ensured,” Nahid said. The rally, which began at 3:00 pm, was attended by leaders and activists of various political, social and cultural organisations. Representatives of BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, Gano Odhikar Parishad, AB Party and Islami Andolan Bangladesh, among others, joined the programme. Sharif Osman Hadi, spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha and an independent aspirant for the Dhaka-8 parliamentary constituencies was critically wounded in a broad-daylight shooting by unidentified assailants in the capital’s Paltan area on December 12. Hadi was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital. For advanced treatment, Hadi left for Singapore today on an air ambulance.",

        "body": "An Indian citizen from Murshidabad district of West Bengal has allegedly obtained Bangladeshi citizenship using false information. Local residents said that the man, identified in India as Saher Ali Sardar, 38, obtained a Bangladeshi birth registration in March 2020 and a national identity card in July 2022 under the name Md Akash Pramanik. They said that Saher came to Bangladesh several years ago to visit relatives and never returned. He later concealed his identity, married at Dhopapara under Puthia upazila in Rajshahi, and managed to obtain the Bangladeshi documents. Saher, son of Sohrab Sardar of Bantai Dangapara Sani Mandir area in Murshidabad, changed his name and address to secure Bangladeshi citizenship. The matter has come to light recently when Asma Begum, listed as his mother in his Bangladeshi NID, filed a complaint with the Rajshahi district administration, demanding cancellation of his citizenship. According to his Indian unique identification card (ID number 339991663915), Saher Ali was born on January 1, 1988. In Bangladeshi documents, Akash Pramanik’s birth certificate (No 1998811820415762) lists his date of birth as January 15, 1990, and his address as Dhopapara village at Puthia upazila in Rajshahi. Asma told New Age that they had taken Saher in about seven years ago when he claimed to be homeless. ‘Later, I found that he used my and my husband’s national ID information to make his own under a false name. He even married here. I want him sent back to his own country,’ she said. She added that Saher had used her name to register a SIM card and apply for official documents. Contacted, Saher admitted that he is an Indian citizen but denied the allegations of wrongdoing by himself in obtaining Bangladeshi documents, claiming that Asma and her husband had arranged all the documents for him. ‘I was an orphan, and they took me in. I did not commit any fraud,’ he said, adding that Asma and her husband forced him out of their house four years ago after a family dispute. He said that he had obtained a Bangladeshi NID card several years ago and a passport that he used to travel abroad. Puthia upazila nirbahi officer Liaquat Salman said that a probe in this connection had been ordered by the district administration. ‘The upazila agriculture officer has been assigned to investigate and submit a report,’ he said. Upazila agriculture officer Smriti Rani Sarker said that the inquiry was under way.",

        "title": "নির্বাচন কি তাহলে মধ্য ও ডানপন্থার লড়াইয়ের দিকে যাচ্ছে",
        "body": "দেশ নির্বাচনের আবহাওয়ার মধ্যে ঢুকেছে। তবে এর ঠিক আগে আগে বেশ কিছু গুরুতর, গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ও যুগান্তকারী ঘটনার সাক্ষী হয়েছে বাংলাদেশ। এই ঘটনাগুলোর প্রভাব শুধু আগামী নির্বাচনে নয়, বরং আরও সুদূরপ্রসারী হবে বলেই মনে হয়। নির্বাচনবিরোধী প্রকাশ্য-অপ্রকাশ্য একটি শক্তির সক্রিয়তা নানা সময়ে টের পাওয়া গেছে। নির্বাচনের তফসিল ঘোষণার পরপরই বলা যায় পরিকল্পিত এক হত্যাকাণ্ডের শিকার হয়েছেন ইনকিলাব মঞ্চের আহ্বায়ক ও সম্ভাব্য সংসদ সদস্য পদপ্রার্থী শরিফ ওসমান হাদি। তাঁর হত্যাকাণ্ড দেশের মানুষকে ক্ষুব্ধ করেছে। এ ঘটনাকে নির্বাচনবিরোধী তৎপরতা হিসেবে বিবেচনা করার সুযোগ আছে। কারণ, এ ধরনের ঘটনা জনমনে একধরনের নিরাপত্তাহীনতা ও নির্বাচন নিয়ে অনিশ্চয়তার বোধ তৈরি করে। এর উল্টো দিকে লাখ লাখ স্বতঃস্ফূর্ত মানুষ শহীদ হাদির জানাজায় হাজির হয়ে তাঁর প্রতি তাঁদের শ্রদ্ধা ও সমর্থন প্রকাশ করেছেন। আবার একই সঙ্গে হাদির মৃত্যুর মতো এই মর্মান্তিক ঘটনাকে পুঁজি করে প্রথম আলো ও ডেইলি স্টার–এর মতো সংবাদমাধ্যমে হামলা ও অগ্নিসংযোগের ঘটনা ঘটে। এ ঘটনাকেও নির্বাচনবিরোধী হিসেবে বিবেচনা করার যথেষ্ট কারণ আছে। নির্বাচনের আগে এ ধরনের সহিংসতা আইনশৃঙ্খলা পরিস্থিতি নিয়ন্ত্রণে সরকারের ব্যর্থতাকেই নির্দেশ করে। শান্তিপূর্ণ পরিস্থিতি ও আইনশৃঙ্খলা নিয়ন্ত্রণে রাখার সক্ষমতার সঙ্গে একটি অবাধ ও শান্তিপূর্ণ নির্বাচনের সম্পর্ক রয়েছে। নির্বাচন সামনে রেখে রাজনৈতিক মেরুকরণও ঘটেছে। গণ-অভ্যুত্থানে নেতৃত্ব দেওয়া ছাত্রদের দল এনসিপি জামায়াতের সঙ্গে জোট করে নির্বাচনে যাচ্ছে। রাজনৈতিকভাবে দেখলে এটা সাধারণ নির্বাচনী সমঝোতার চেয়ে বড় কিছু। কারণ, এর মধ্য দিয়ে এনসিপির অবস্থানটি স্পষ্ট হয়েছে। দলটির রাজনৈতিক ধারা কী, এ নিয়ে যাঁদের কৌতূহল ছিল, তাঁরা জবাব পেয়ে গেছেন। এনসিপির এ অবস্থানকে তাদের রাজনৈতিক ধারা অনুযায়ী ‘সঠিক গন্তব্যে’ যাত্রা হিসেবে বিবেচনা করা যেতে পারে। দলটির মূল নেতাদের অনেকে তাঁদের আদর্শের জায়গাটি ইতিমধ্যেই নানাভাবে পরিষ্কার করেছেন। তা ছাড়া আলোচনায় আছে, দলটিকে সংগঠিত করতে জামায়াত নানাভাবে সহযোগিতা করেছে। বিশেষ করে নির্বাচন কমিশনের নিবন্ধন নিশ্চিত করার জন্য সারা দেশে দ্রুত কমিটি গঠন বা এনসিপির সভা-সমাবেশে লোকবল সরবরাহ—এসব ক্ষেত্রে জামায়াতের ভূমিকার কথা নানা সূত্রে জানা যায়। এনসিপি শেষ পর্যন্ত ‘সঠিক গন্তব্য’ বেছে নেওয়ায় কিছু নেতা-কর্মীর বিভ্রান্তিও দূর হয়েছে। দলটির মধ্যে ক্ষীণ যে বাম ও মধ্যপন্থী ধারা ছিল বা নারী ইস্যুতে এনসিপির ভূমিকায় যাঁরা বিরক্ত ছিলেন, তাঁরা ইতিমধ্যেই নিষ্ক্রিয় হয়েছেন অথবা ঘোষণা দিয়ে দল ছেড়েছেন। এই ধারা অব্যাহত আছে। এর মধ্য দিয়ে ‘পরিশুদ্ধ’ হয়ে পুরোপুরি ডানপন্থী আদর্শের দলে পরিণত হতে পারে এনসিপি। জামায়াতের নির্বাচনী জোটে যুক্ত হয়ে এনসিপি কী লাভ করবে, অন্তত আসন পাওয়ার দিক থেকে, তা বোঝার জন্য নির্বাচনের ফলাফল পর্যন্ত অপেক্ষা করতে হবে। তবে রাজনৈতিকভাবে তারা সমাজের মধ্যপন্থী ও জনমতের ওপর প্রভাব বিস্তারকারী একটি নাগরিক গোষ্ঠীর আস্থা যে হারিয়েছে, তাতে কোনো সন্দেহ নেই। বাংলাদেশের রাজনীতিতে স্বাধীনতাবিরোধী শক্তি হিসেবে বিবেচিত জামায়াত তার রাজনৈতিক পথচলায় আওয়ামী লীগ ও বিএনপি—দুই দলের সঙ্গে মিলেমিশেই এগিয়েছে, আন্দোলন করেছে। আওয়ামী লীগের সঙ্গে এক হয়ে বিএনপি সরকারের বিদায় নিশ্চিত করেছে। আবার বিএনপির সঙ্গে জোট করে সরকারের অংশীদারও হয়েছে। তবে জামায়াত তার রাজনৈতিক ইতিহাসে এখন সবচেয়ে ভালো সময় পার করছে। একাত্তরের বাংলাদেশবিরোধী অবস্থান ও অপকর্মকে চব্বিশের গণ-অভ্যুত্থান দিয়ে ঢেকে ফেলার চেষ্টায় তারা অনেকটাই সফল হয়েছে। জামায়াতের নির্বাচনী জোটে এনসিপিকে যুক্ত করতে পারা সেই সাফল্যে নতুন পালক হিসেবেই বিবেচিত হবে। বাংলাদেশের রাজনীতিতে ঐতিহাসিক কারণেই গ্রহণযোগ্যতার সংকটে থাকা জামায়াত এনসিপিকে সঙ্গী করার মধ্য দিয়ে যে নিজেকে সাফসুতরা করার পথে আরও এগিয়ে গেল, তাতে সন্দেহ নেই। একই ধারাবাহিকতায় মুক্তিযুদ্ধের বীর বিক্রম কর্নেল অলির দল এলডিপিকে যুক্ত ও বিএনপির মেজর (অব) আখতারুজ্জামানকে দলে নিতে পারাও জামায়াতের বড় সাফল্য। বোঝা যায়, জামায়াত তাদের ছাতাটি বড় করে ইসলামপন্থীদের বাইরেও নানা রাজনৈতিক শক্তিকে যুক্ত করার চেষ্টা করছে। জামায়াতের এই বৃহত্তর ছাতা বিএনপিকে কতটা চ্যালেঞ্জ ছুড়ে দিতে পারে, সেটাই এখন দেখার বিষয়। ১৭ বছর নির্বাসনে থাকা বিএনপির ভারপ্রাপ্ত চেয়ারম্যান তারেক রহমানের দেশে ফেরা এ সময়ের রাজনীতিতে সবচেয়ে আলোচিত ঘটনা হিসেবে বিবেচিত হতে পারত। ২৫ ডিসেম্বর দেশে ফেরা ও লাখ লাখ মানুষের সমাবেশে তাঁর ‘আমার’ বা ‘আমাদের’ একটি পরিকল্পনা আছে—এ ঘোষণা দেশের রাজনীতিতে ঐতিহাসিক উপলক্ষ হিসেবেই বিবেচিত হবে। কিন্তু দলের চেয়ারপারসন খালেদা জিয়ার মৃত্যু এবং তাঁর জানাজায় ইতিহাসের সবচেয়ে বড় লোকসমাগম ও দলমতের বাইরে তাঁর প্রতি যে মাত্রার জনশ্রদ্ধা দেখা গেল, তা সবকিছুকে ছাপিয়ে গেছে। তারেক রহমানের ফিরে আসা ও খালেদা জিয়ার মারা যাওয়ার পরের আবেগ-অনুভূতির অভাবিত ঘটনাপ্রবাহ ভোটের মাঠে বিএনপিকে অনেক এগিয়ে দিয়েছে। বিপুল জয়ের ব্যাপারে বিএনপি মধ্যে যেমন আত্মবিশ্বাস বেড়েছে, তেমনি জনমনেও এ ধারণা জোরালো হচ্ছে। নির্বাচনে ফলাফল নিয়ে যাঁদের মধ্যে ভিন্ন ধারণা আছে বা ছিল, তাঁদের হয়তো নতুন করে হিসাব-নিকাশ করতে হবে। তবে বড় জয়ের আত্মবিশ্বাস অনেক সময় ভোটের বাক্সে গিয়ে ভেঙে যায়। ১৯৯১ সালের নির্বাচনকে আমরা এ ক্ষেত্রে দৃষ্টান্ত মানতে পারি। আওয়ামী লীগ জিতেই গেছে, সরকার গঠন করছে—এমন আওয়াজের মধ্যে তখন জয় পায় বিএনপি। দীর্ঘদিন ক্ষমতার বাইরে থাকা বিএনপি জুলাই গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের পর থেকে রাজনৈতিকভাবে সতর্ক অবস্থান নিয়েছে। দেশের রাজনীতি এখন পর্যন্ত যে জায়গায় এসে দাঁড়িয়েছে, তাতে বিএনপি এই কৌশল কাজে দিয়েছে বলে মনে হয়। তা ছাড়া গণ-অভ্যুত্থানের পর আওয়ামী লীগবিহীন রাজনৈতিক পরিসরে বিএনপি দল হিসেবে নিজেকে মধ্যপন্থী হিসেবে প্রতিষ্ঠার চেষ্টা চালিয়ে গেছে। যদিও দলটিতে ডান ধারার লোকজনের উপস্থিতি ও প্রভাব অস্বীকার কারার উপায় নেই। ক্ষমতায় গেলে কোন পক্ষ কীভাবে দেশ চালাবে, কতটা সুশাসন দেবে, নাগরিক অধিকার বা নাগরিক সুযোগ-সুবিধা নিশ্চিত করতে কী করবে, তা একটা বিবেচনা। কিন্তু রাজনৈতিক ধারার দিক থেকে দেখলে আগামী নির্বাচনের মূল লড়াইটা হবে মধ্য ও ডানপন্থার মধ্যে। কারণ, রাজনৈতিক শক্তি হিসেবে বাম বা মধ্যবাম ধারা বলে কোনো পক্ষ এবারের নির্বাচনে সেভাবে মাঠে নেই। ভোটারদের সম্ভবত এ দুই পক্ষ থেকেই কোনো পক্ষকে বেছে নিতে হবে। নির্বাচনে নিষিদ্ধ আওয়ামী লীগের সমর্থক ভোটারদের ভোট কোন দিকে যাবে, সেটাও এক বড় প্রশ্ন। তারা কি তাদের রাজনৈতিক বিবেচনা থেকে ‘মন্দের ভালো’ বেছে নেবে নাকি ‘নেতিবাচক’ ভোটের পথ ধরবে? আগের যেকোনো নির্বাচনের তুলনায় এবারের বাস্তবতা ও হিসাব-নিকাশ পুরো আলাদা। নির্বাচন বলতে যা বোঝায়, তা ২০০৮ সালের পর হয়নি। সে কারণে ভোটের ফলাফল ধরে রাজনৈতিক দলগুলোর প্রতি সমর্থনের হালনাগাদ কোনো ডেটা বা তথ্য নেই। আবার ১৭ বছর আগের ডেটাকেও বিবেচনা করা যাচ্ছে না। এর মধ্যে অনেক নতুন ভোটার হয়েছেন, যাঁরা কখনো ভোট দেননি। এই সময়ে দেশ গেছে এক নিপীড়নমূলক স্বৈরশাসনের মধ্য দিয়ে। ২০১৮ সালে স্কুলের শিক্ষার্থীরা নিরাপদ সড়ক আন্দোলন করে সেই শাসনের ভিত কাঁপিয়ে দিয়েছিল। বলা যায়, এর ধারাবাহিকতায় সফল হয়েছে চব্বিশের গণ-অভ্যুত্থান, যার নেতৃত্ব দিয়েছে ছাত্র ও তরুণেরা। এই গণ-অভ্যুত্থান আমাদের সামনে এক নতুন প্রজন্মকে হাজির করেছে, যাদের চিন্তাভাবনা ও মনোজগৎ আমাদের অনেকেরই জানা-বোঝার বাইরে। আমরা কি জানি বা ধারণা করতে পারি যে তাদের ভোট কোন দিকে যাবে? তা ছাড়া প্রবাসী ভোটারেরাও এবার প্রথমবারের মতো ভোট দেওয়ার সুযোগ পাচ্ছেন। ভোটের হিসাব-নিকাশ যাঁরা করছেন, তাঁরা এই বাস্তবতাকে বিবেচনায় নিচ্ছেন কি? শুরুতে বলেছি, দেশ নির্বাচনী আবহাওয়ার মধ্যে ঢুকেছে। একই সঙ্গে এটাও বলেছি, নির্বাচনবিরোধী প্রকাশ্য-অপ্রকাশ্য একটি শক্তির সক্রিয়তা নানা সময়ে টের পাওয়া গেছে। প্রশ্ন হচ্ছে, সেই শক্তি কি একেবারেই নিষ্ক্রিয় হয়ে গেছে? মনে হয় না। কিন্তু বাংলাদেশের সামনে এখন একটিই পথ, নির্বাচন। এর বাইরে অন্য কোনো কিছু গ্রহণ করার বাস্তবতা বা সক্ষমতা বাংলাদেশের নেই। আগামী ১২ ফেব্রুয়ারি একটি সুষ্ঠু, অবাধ ও শান্তিপূর্ণ নির্বাচন অনুষ্ঠানের চ্যালেঞ্জে অন্তর্বর্তীকালীন সরকারসহ দেশের সব গণতান্ত্রিক রাজনৈতিক শক্তিকে বিজয়ী হতেই হবে। এ কে এম জাকারিয়া প্রথম

Mainul Hossain Munna, 26, a nephew of former Jamaat lawmaker Shahjahan Chowdhury, who sustained injuries during the raid, died at Chittagong Medical College Hospital around 11:00pm Friday, reports our Chittagong correspondent. ANM Shamsul Islam, lawmaker of Jamaat of Satkania constituency, announced the hartal around 3:35pm Saturday while attending the namaz-e-janaza of Mainul. Failing to nab Shahjahan, the law enforcers pushed Mainul off the rooftop of the house on March 13, Shahjahan claimed. Police raided the house of Shahjahan on the night of March 13 to arrest the Jamaat leader on charges of creating anarchy in Satkania upazila on February 28, said Md Iltutmish, additional superintendent of police (ASP) of Chittagong South zone. Anticipating detention, Mainul ran towards the rooftop of the four storey building and fell down, the ASP said. He was rushed to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries Friday night, Iltutmish added.

করেছে বিএনপি। প্রার্থী ঘোষণার পর প্রকাশ্যে আসে দলের নেতা-কর্মীদের বিরোধ। প্রার্থীরা এলাকায় জনসংযোগ শুরু করলেও তাঁদের সঙ্গে নেই দলের মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশী অন্য নেতা ও তাঁদের অনুসারীরা। উল্টো দল মনোনীত প্রার্থীর বিরুদ্ধে বিক্ষোভ, সড়ক অবরোধসহ নানা কর্মসূচি অব্যাহত রেখেছেন তাঁরা। এখন বিরোধ মেটানোর চেষ্টায় রয়েছে বিএনপি। বিএনপির স্থায়ী কমিটির সদস্য আমীর খসরু মাহমুদ চৌধুরী প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, দল যাঁকে যোগ্য মনে করেছে, তাঁকে প্রার্থী করেছে। নির্বাচন ঘনিয়ে এলে সবাই ধানের শীষের জন্য কাঁধে কাঁধ মিলিয়ে কাজ করবেন। জামায়াতে ইসলামী এসব আসনের প্রতিটিতেই দলীয় প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করেছে। প্রায় ৮ মাস ধরে এলাকায় জনসংযোগ করে আসছেন দলের প্রার্থীরা। নির্বাচন সামনে রেখে কোনো প্রচার-প্রচারণায় নেই জাতীয় পার্টি। জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টি (এনসিপি) প্রার্থী ঘোষণা না করলেও প্রতিটি আসনে সম্ভাব্য প্রার্থীরা তৎপর রয়েছেন। কিছু আসনে প্রার্থী দিয়েছে গণসংহতি আন্দোলন। এ ছাড়া ইসলামী আন্দোলন, বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্টসহ কয়েকটি ইসলামপন্থী দলের প্রার্থীরাও মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম নগরসহ জেলায় সংসদীয় আসন রয়েছে ১৬টি। এর মধ্যে চট্টগ্রাম উত্তরের সাতটি উপজেলায় আসন রয়েছে সাতটি। ১৯৯১ থেকে ২০০৮ সাল পর্যন্ত পাঁচটি সংসদ নির্বাচনে চট্টগ্রামের উত্তরের সাতটি আসনে বিএনপি জয় পেয়েছে বেশি—২০ বার। অন্যদিকে ওইসব নির্বাচনে আওয়ামী লীগ (বর্তমানের কার্যক্রম নিষিদ্ধ) জয় পায় (একবার উপনির্বাচনসহ) ১১ বার। জাতীয় পার্টি, বাংলাদেশের কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি, বিলুপ্ত ন্যাশনাল ডেমোক্রেটিক পার্টি (এনডিপি) একবার করে জয় পায়। এ ছাড়া দুবার জয় পান স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থীরা। তবে প্রার্থী থাকলেও জামায়াতে ইসলামী এসব আসনে কখনো জয় পায়নি। ২০১৪, ২০১৮ ও ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনে একক নিয়ন্ত্রণ ছিল আওয়ামী লীগের। চট্টগ্রাম-১ (মিরসরাই) বিএনপি এই আসনে প্রার্থী করেছে দলের চট্টগ্রাম উত্তর জেলা শাখার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক ও সাবেক উপজেলা চেয়ারম্যান নুরুল আমিনকে। ২০১৮ সালের নির্বাচনেও দলীয় প্রার্থী ছিলেন তিনি। আসনটিতে বিএনপির মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশীদের মধ্যে আরও ছিলেন জেলা শাখার

সাবেক আহ্বায়ক শাহীদুল ইসলাম চৌধুরী বলেন, বিভিন্ন সন্ত্রাসী কার্যক্রমের জন্য নুরুল আমিনকে দল থেকে বহিষ্কার করা হয়েছিল। তড়িঘড়ি করে তা প্রত্যাহার করে তাঁকে মনোনয়ন দেওয়া হয়। এতে ধানের শীষের প্রার্থীকে জিতিয়ে আনা কঠিন হয়ে পড়বে। এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন) ও ২০০১ সালে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়ী হয়েছিলেন। ১৯৯৬ (উপনির্বাচন) ও ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। মিরসরাইয়ে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন দলের উপজেলা শাখার সেক্রেটারি সাইফুর রহমান। এনসিপির উত্তর জেলার যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক আশরাফ উদ্দিন এবং ইসলামী আন্দোলনের হয়ে ফেরদৌস আহমদ চৌধুরীও মাঠে সক্রিয় রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-২ (ফটিকছড়ি) এই আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী দলের উত্তর জেলা শাখার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক সরওয়ার আলমগীর। তাঁকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণায় ক্ষুব্ধ হয়ে উপজেলা বিএনপির আহ্বায়ক মো. আজিম উল্লাহ বাহারের অনুসারীরা সড়ক অবরোধ করেন। ২০১৮ সালের নির্বাচনে আজিম উল্লাহ দলীয় প্রার্থী ছিলেন। সরোয়ার আলমগীর প্রচারণা শুরু করলেও আজিম উল্লাহ বাহারের অনুসারীরা তাঁর সঙ্গে নেই। ফটিকছড়িতে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (জুন) ও ২০০১ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে জয়ী হন বিএনপির প্রার্থী। এ ছাড়া ১৯৯৬–এর ফেব্রুয়ারিতে স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। ফটিকছড়িতে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী দলের নগর শাখার সেক্রেটারি নুরুল আমিন। এ ছাড়া গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে মিজানুর রহীম চৌধুরী, ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে জুলফিকার আলী এবং বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে আবদুল হামিদ নির্বাচন সামনে রেখে জনসংযোগ করছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৩ (সন্দ্বীপ) বিএনপি এই আসনে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করেনি। দলের মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশীদের মধ্যে রয়েছেন সাবেক সংসদ সদস্য মোস্তফা কামাল পাশা, উত্তর জেলা বিএনপির সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক বেলায়েত হোসেন, বিএনপির কেন্দ্রীয় কমিটির সদস্য মিজানুর রহমান ও তরিকুল আলম। দলীয় সূত্রে জানা গেছে, নির্বাচনী জোট হলে বিএনপি আসনটি এলডিপির জন্য ছেড়ে দিতে পারে। এলডিপির পক্ষ থেকে এই আসনে দলের সভাপতিমণ্ডলীর সদস্য চৌধুরী হাসান সারওয়ার্দীকে মনোনয়ন দেওয়া হয়েছে। এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (জুন) আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী নির্বাচিত হয়। অপরদিকে ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি), ২০০১ ও ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। সন্দ্বীপে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন দলের উত্তর জেলার আমির আলাউদ্দিন সিকদার। এ ছাড়া আসনটিতে ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে আমজাদ হোসেন এবং গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে তাহসিন মাহমুদকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়েছে। এনসিপি এখনো প্রার্থী দেয়নি। চট্টগ্রাম-৪ (সীতাকুণ্ড) সীতাকুণ্ড আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী উত্তর জেলার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক কাজী সালাউদ্দিন। প্রার্থী ঘোষণার পর বিএনপির সাবেক যুগ্ম মহাসচিব আসলাম চৌধুরীর অনুসারীরা মহাসড়ক অবরোধ, মানববন্ধনসহ বিভিন্ন কর্মসূচি পালন করেছেন। আসলাম চৌধুরীর পক্ষে রাস্তায় নেমে দল থেকে বহিষ্কার হয়েছেন সাতজন নেতা। কাজী সালাউদ্দিন বলেন, ‘আমি মনোনয়ন চেয়ে জীবনবৃত্তান্তও জমা দিইনি। দল আমাকে মনোনয়ন দিয়েছে।’ তবে মনোনয়ন পাওয়ার বিষয়ে এখনো আশাবাদী আসলাম চৌধুরী। তিনি বলেন, ‘এখনো সময় আছে। ধানের শীষ প্রতীক আমারই থাকবে। আমি নির্বাচন করব।’ এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি) ও ২০০১ সালে বিএনপি জয়ী হয়। ১৯৯৬ (জুন) ও ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। আসনটিতে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী করা হয়েছে দলের উত্তর জেলা শাখার সেক্রেটারি আনোয়ারুল সিদ্দিকীকে। এ ছাড়া এনসিপি থেকে তানজিদ রহমান, গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে জাহিদুল আলম আল জাহিদ, ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে দিদারুল মাওলা, বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে আবুল আসাদ মো. জুবায়ের রেজভী মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৫ (হাটহাজারী ও বায়েজিদের একাংশ) দলের কেন্দ্রীয় সহসাংগঠনিক সম্পাদক মীর মোহাম্মদ হেলাল উদ্দিনকে বিএনপি থেকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়। এই আসনে দলের মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশী ছিলেন বিএনপির চেয়ারপারসনের উপদেষ্টা এস এম ফজলুল হক এবং সাবেক সংসদ সদস্য সৈয়দ ওয়াহিদুল আলমের মেয়ে শাকিলা ফারজানা। প্রার্থী পরিবর্তনের দাবিতে ফজলুর হকের অনুসারীরা সড়ক অবরোধসহ নানা কর্মসূচি পালন করছেন। জানতে চাইলে তিনি প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, নেতা-কর্মীরা চাইছেন প্রার্থী পরিবর্তনের বিষয়টি বিবেচনার জন্য। বিএনপির প্রার্থী মীর মোহাম্মদ হেলাল উদ্দিন বলেন, ‘আওয়ামী লীগের নির্যাতন সহ্য করে দীর্ঘ ১৭ বছর হাটহাজারীবাসীর সঙ্গে ছিলাম। ছোটখাটো বিরোধিতায় মানুষ বিভ্রান্ত হবে না।’ জমিয়তে উলামায়ে ইসলামের প্রার্থী হিসেবে হাটহাজারীতে মাঠে রয়েছেন হেফাজতে ইসলামের যুগ্ম মহাসচিব নাছির উদ্দিন মুনির। জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে জনসংযোগ চালিয়ে যাচ্ছেন উপজেলা জামায়াতের সেক্রেটারি আবদুল মালেক। এ ছাড়া ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে মতিউল্লাহ নুরী ও বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে মীর আবদুর রহিম মুনিরী প্রার্থী হিসেবে জনসংযোগ করছেন। তবে এনসিপি এখনো প্রার্থী দেয়নি। ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন), ২০০১ সালে এই আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের সঙ্গে জোট হয়ে জাতীয় পার্টির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। রাউজানে বিএনপির প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়নি। উত্তর জেলা বিএনপির সাবেক আহ্বায়ক গোলাম আকবর খন্দকার ও কেন্দ্রীয় ভাইস চেয়ারম্যান (পদ স্থগিত) গিয়াস উদ্দিন কাদের চৌধুরী মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশী। স্থানীয় রাজনীতিতে দুজনের বিরোধ দীর্ঘদিনের। রাউজানে গত বছরের ৫ আগস্টের পর সহিংসতায় মোট ১৭টি হত্যাকাণ্ডের ঘটনা ঘটেছে। এর মধ্যে ১২টি রাজনৈতিক হত্যাকাণ্ড বলে জানিয়েছে পুলিশ। বিএনপির দুই নেতার অনুসারীদের কোন্দলের জেরে খুন হন অন্তত ৭ জন। এ ছাড়া একই সময় শতবারের বেশি সংঘর্ষে জড়িয়েছে দুটি পক্ষ। ১৯৯১ সালে এনডিপি, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন) বিএনপি, ২০০১ ও ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। এই আসনে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী উপজেলা আমির শাহজাহান মঞ্জুর। এ ছাড়া গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে নাসির উদ্দিন তালুকদার, ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে ইলিয়াস নুরী ও ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে জিয়াউর রহমান মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৭ (রাঙ্গুনিয়া) বিএনপির কেন্দ্রীয় নির্বাহী কমিটির সদস্য হুম্মাম কাদের চৌধুরী দলীয় প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন। তবে দীর্ঘদিন ধরে এলাকায় থাকা উপজেলা বিএনপির আহ্বায়ক কুতুব উদ্দিন বাহার মনোনয়ন না পাওয়ায় তাঁর অনুসারীরা ক্ষুব্ধ। হুম্মামের সঙ্গে তাঁরা মাঠে নামেননি। হুম্মাম কাদের চৌধুরী বলেন, ‘সবার সঙ্গে আমি কথা বলছি, ইতিমধ্যে বসেছি। অনেকেই দলের প্রার্থীর পক্ষে চলে এসেছেন।’ কুতুব উদ্দিন বাহার বলেন, ‘দল এখনো চূড়ান্ত প্রার্থী দেয়নি, তাই অপেক্ষায় রয়েছি। দল যে সিদ্ধান্ত দেবে, সেটি মেনে নেব।’ এই আসনে ১৯৯১ সালে কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি, ১৯৯৬ সালের ফেব্রুয়ারিতে স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থী (বিএনপির বিদ্রোহী), একই বছরের জুনে বিএনপি, ২০০১ সালে বিএনপি এবং ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগ জয় পায়। এই আসনে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন জামায়াত–সমর্থিত ন্যাশনাল ডক্টরস ফোরামের (এনডিএফ) চট্টগ্রাম নগরের সভাপতি এ টি এম রেজাউল করিম। তিনি বলেন, ‘আওয়ামী লীগের হাতে ১৭ বছর জিম্মি থাকা রাঙ্গুনিয়াবাসী পরিবর্তনের অপেক্ষায়।’",

The deceased, identified as Md Jahid aged between 20 and 25 years, was a resident of the Geneva Camp, said the police. Mohammadpur police station officer-in-charge Kazi Rafiq Ahmed told New Age that the incident occurred at about 3:40am inside the camp. Initial information suggested that Jahid suffered serious injuries in a cocktail explosion during a clash between two groups inside the camp, he said. Quoting witnesses, the police official said, ‘A violent altercation broke out between two groups inside the camp early Thursday. When Jahid stepped out of his house during the clash, a cocktail exploded, leaving him critically injured.’ Filing a case regarding the incident was under way, he added. Jahid’s relative Robin Hossain said that Jahid walked a short distance from his house during the clash to see what was happening when a cocktail exploded and struck him on his head. ‘We first took Jahid to a nearby medical facility and later he was transferred to the emergency department of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where the on-duty doctors declared him dead at about 4:30am,’ he said.

        "title": "Bangladesh to unite against Indian hegemony on Victory Day: Nahid",
        "body": "National Citizen Party (NCP) Convener Md Nahid Islam today said the people of Bangladesh would unite on Victory Day tomorrow against the Indian hegemony and all conspiracies targeting the country. “On Victory Day tomorrow, we will not take to the streets for celebration. We will take to the streets for resistance. In Dhaka and across Bangladesh, we will hold resistance rallies against Indian hegemony and all anti-Bangladesh conspiracies,” he added. Nahid was addressing the all-party resistance rally protesting the attempted killing of Osman Hadi, organised by Inqilab Mancha at the Central Shaheed Minar this afternoon. The NCP Convener said December 16 symbolises not only victory but also the beginning of a long journey of resistance. “Just as we achieved victory on December 16, 1971, our journey of resistance also began that day. That resistance was against Indian aggression, and it has continued to this day,” he said. He said if India believed it could continue political interference in Bangladesh after August 5, including manipulating elections, “that assumption is wrong and will be proven wrong”. Referring to the shooting of Osman Hadi, Nahid said the attack was not an isolated incident. “With the bullet hitting Osman Hadi, the July Revolution has been attacked. Every time Bangladesh is attacked, its youth rise in resistance,” he said. In this connection, he said that the rally carried a clear message that Bangladesh and the forces of the July Revolution remain united. Nahid also questioned the moral legitimacy of the Chief Election Commissioner following his recent remarks. “After such statements, he has no moral right to remain in office. Whether a free and fair election is possible under him is a question before the nation,” he said and expressed the hope that the statement would be withdrawn immediately. Nahid said calls had been raised for the resignation of the home adviser, arguing that he had lost moral authority to remain in office. “Since August 5, the law and order situation has not returned to normalcy. Participants of the July uprising have been targeted, martyr families harassed, and justice has not been ensured,” Nahid said. The rally, which began at 3:00 pm, was attended by leaders and activists of various political, social and cultural organisations. Representatives of BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, Gano Odhikar Parishad, AB Party and Islami Andolan Bangladesh, among others, joined the programme. Sharif Osman Hadi, spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha and an independent aspirant for the Dhaka-8 parliamentary constituencies was critically wounded in a broad-daylight shooting by unidentified assailants in the capital’s Paltan area on December 12. Hadi was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital. For advanced treatment, Hadi left for Singapore today on an air ambulance.",

        "body": "People in large numbers thronged the gravesite of Osman Hadi from Sunday dawn, forming long queues to pay their respects. The area remained heavily crowded as mourners, many traveling from distant areas, gathered to offer prayers and visit the grave. Security personnel and volunteers were seen managing the flow of visitors to prevent congestion on the adjacent roadway. Mourners came from different parts of the city, and from outside the capital as well, arrived to offer prayers and pay their last respects. Many carried flowers, recited verses from the Quran and stood silently in contemplation at the graveside.Witnesses said mass people started gathering before sunrise. By mid morning, the crowd had swelled, spilling over onto the adjoining footpaths and even part of the roadway. The heavy turnout caused significant congestion in the surrounding area. Traffic slowed to a crawl as motorists attempted to navigate through the mass of pedestrians, parked vehicles and onlookers. At several points, police and traffic officials were seen redirecting vehicles and asking pedestrians to remain on one side of the road. Rickshaw pullers and motorcyclists waited impatiently at intersections as the crowd periodically blocked their path. Law enforcement agencies and local authorities deployed additional personnel to the site to ensure security and crowd control. Bangladesh plunged into grief as the nation observed a state mourning day for Sharif Osman Bin Hadi, the intrepid Inqilab Moncho activist whose brutal killing has ignited outrage and renewed calls for justice. He was a living reflex of Kazi Nazrul Islam in our fractured times, exposed the rot of corruption with a courage that now defines his eternal legacy. Hadi’s final hours unfolded like a tragedy scripted in truthfulness and transparent justice. Hadi’s life was a heroic ideal of unmasked truths, delivered with the raw fire of a poet-warrior. Rising from the streets of Dhaka, he joined Inqilab Moncho – a youth-led movement demanding accountability after the July Revolution. His “bloody revelations,” as activists call them, were livestreams and speeches that peeled back the veil on the superior classes’ corruption. “Corruption is the cancer eating our revolution,” Hadi roared in one clip, viewed millions of times. His words, laced with Quranic verses and Nazrul’s rebellious fervour, mobilised thousands, turning Inqilab Moncho into a mass medium against the very betrayals that birthed the uprising. Sharif Osman Bin Hadi was no armchair critic. He embodied patriotism’s purest form: selfless, honest, and unrelenting and he was born to humble roots, he dropped university to lead street protests, embodying Nazrul’s “Bidrohi” spirit, the rebel poet who defied colonial chains.",

They also said that some political forces were trying to delay the election, which would resist the democratic transition and worsen the political situation of the country. The SPB leaders called on all the democratic political parties to be united to resist the undemocratic political forces. Chaired by general secretary of the party Bazlur Rashid Firoz, the SPB organised the rally in front of the National Press Club to mark the 45th founding anniversary of the party and the 108th anniversary of the Russian Socialist Revolution. Bazlur Rahman Firoz said that the interim government had failed to implement the spirits of the July uprising in the past 14 months. ‘So, holding next general election in a free, fair and democratic manner is essential for the democratic transition of the country,’ Bazlur Rashid said. Mentioning that some undemocratic political parties are trying to delay the election, he called on all the left and democratic political parties to resist the forces who were trying to delay the election. Assistant general secretary of the party Razequzzaman Ratan said that the interim government had failed to implement the spirits of the July uprising to form a discrimination free society. Mentioning that the interim government has failed to stop corruption and mob violence and to restore law and order of the country, Ratan said, ‘Moreover, they are going to lease out operations of Chattogram and other two ports to the foreign companies, which are contrary to the national interests of the country.’ There is no alternative to holding the general election in February, mentioned SPB central leader Nikhil Das, adding, ‘People of the country are eagerly waiting for early democratic transition of the country.’ Anther central leader Zulfiqur Ali called on all the left political parties to take part in the next general election.

        "title": "Tarique Rahman urges nationalist forces to unite in November 7 spirit",
        "body": "Acting chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party Tarique Rahman on Thursday called upon all nationalist forces to unite in the spirit of the November 7 to build a strong democracy in the country. ‘Protecting national independence and sovereignty is extremely urgent at this moment,’ he said in a message issued on the eve of ‘National Revolution and Solidarity Day’. The BNP acting chairman said that the rise of anti-hegemonic nationalist politics in the country was ushered in by the Sepoy-People’s Revolution on November 7, 1975. ‘The Sepoy-People’s Revolution on November 7, 1975, in the history of Bangladesh is not merely a turning point but the genesis of anti-hegemonic nationalist politics in this land,’ he added. Extending greetings and congratulations to the people of the country on the day, he said, ‘The nation’s sovereignty was protected through the Sepoy-People’s Revolution. On this day in 1975, the soldiers and the populace, fueled by patriotism, took to the streets with the pledge of safeguarding national independence and reviving democracy. Thus, the historic revolution of November 7 is immensely significant.’ Tareque Rahman further said that the ruling group after independence, for its own self-interest, pushed the country into the grip of hegemony. ‘The objective was to cling to power indefinitely, which led to the killing of democracy through the formation of the one-party BKSAL rule. The BKSAL government, adopting extremely undemocratic and fascist methods, snatched away the legitimate rights of the people.’ He continued that during this dire national crisis, on November 3, 1975, conspirators imprisoned the proclaimer of the independence Ziaur Rahman and his family in the cantonment. ‘In this profound national crisis, the fearless soldiers and the surging crowds came together on the streets on November 7, resulting in a unique expression of solidarity to protect national independence, and the proclaimer of independence Ziaur Rahman was freed,’ he said. Tarique said that this change of scene, under the leadership of president Zia, instilled new vitality in the country, and democracy was unfettered, firmly establishing the freedom of speech, expression, and opinion. Peace returned to the minds of the people. ‘However, the domestic agents of the hegemonic forces, viewing president Zia as an impediment to their objectives, brutally assassinated him at the Chattogram Circuit House in 1981. Even though Zia embraced martyrdom, people inspired by his ideals remain united and firmly resolved to defend the nation’s independence and democracy.’ he added. Mentioning the brutal activities of fascist Awami League, he said, ‘Once again, the Awami fascists seized state power through covert conspiracy, destroying democracy for nearly 16 years.’ Tarique Rahman claimed that the nation’s sovereignty was weakened day by day due to their submissive policies. He accused the Awami League fascist government of suppressing pro-democracy activists with horrific cruelty, establishing a terrifying reign of corruption and misrule, including the use of aynaghar (secret detention centers), enforced disappearances, murders, and extrajudicial killings. He also lamented that the ‘symbol of democracy’, Khaleda Zia, was imprisoned for many years without a valid reason. He said that the fascists were compelled to flee the country due to the magnificent self-sacrifice of the students and the people on August 5. He believes the path to the liberation of democracy has now broadened for the people. Tarique Rahman said that to establish the ultimate practice of democracy, it is imperative to ensure people’s fundamental human rights, which are indispensable for democracy, and to hold a free and fair election. He also called for the establishment of justice and good governance in society.",

        "title": "Hadi’s struggles to inspire future generations ENVIRON ADVISER",
        "body": "In a poignant tribute that resonates deeply across Bangladesh’s political and activist circles, Environment Adviser Syeda Rizwana Hasan has mourned the untimely demise of Sharif Osman Hadi, hailing him as an indomitable warrior of the July uprising and the voice of the ‘Inquilab Mancha’. The adviser’s condolence message was released on Friday and she acknowledged Hadi’s fearless, unyielding resistance against oddness describing his passing as an irreplaceable loss to the nation. Hadi, who stood at the forefront of the mass revolution that reshaped the country’s destiny, leaves behind a legacy that promises to ignite the spirits of generations to come. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, serving as adviser to the ministries of Information and Broadcasting; Environment, Forests and Climate Change; and Water Resources, did not hold back in her admiration for Hadi’s role in the historic July movement. “Sharif Osman Hadi was a fearless voice and bold organizer of the July mass uprising,” she declared in her statement, her words carrying the weight of someone who has long championed justice and environmental causes. She recalled how Hadi’s unwavering stance against injustice, oppression, and suppression served as a beacon for democracy-loving people, transforming abstract ideals into a rallying cry that echoed through the streets and squares of Bangladesh. The adviser delved deeper into Hadi’s character, emphasizing the clarity, firmness, and sense of duty with which he articulated the movement’s demands. In an era marked by crackdowns and silencing of dissent, Hadi’s ability to present the language of resistance with such precision ensured its place in the annals of history. Hasan highlighted how his speeches and actions cut through the noise, mobilising the masses with a message that was both uncompromising and profoundly relatable. This was no mere participant in the protests; Hadi was a strategist, a communicator whose words galvanised thousands, turning individual grievances into a collective force for change. Reflecting on his broader impact, Rizwana Hasan underscored Hadi’s pivotal role in awakening the youth and building public opinion on critical issues of rights and justice. As the spokesperson for ‘Inquilab Mancha’, he bridged the gap between the streets and the national discourse, ensuring that the voices of the oppressed were not just heard but amplified. His contributions, she noted, are undeniable-forged in the crucible of real struggles, where every rally, every chant, and every confrontation added to his stature as a symbol of resilience. In a nation still healing from the wounds of authoritarianism, Hadi’s work in fostering awareness among the younger generation stands as a testament to his foresight and dedication.“Hadi’s struggling life, ideals, and courage will inspire future generations to stand firm against injustice,” she affirmed, evoking images of students, activists, and ordinary citizens drawing strength from his example. In a time when the July uprising’s heroes are being remembered as architects of a new Bangladesh, not just as a martyr of the moment, but as an eternal motivator. His life story marked by personal sacrifices, bold confrontations with powerful, unshakeable commitment to equity serves as boldness those who will carry the torch forward. Concluding her message with spiritual solace and empathy, the adviser prayed for the forgiveness of the departed soul and extended her deepest condolences to Hadi’s grieving family, comrades, and co-members.",

But Mark Major, one of the world's leading lighting designers, believes we're at the early stages of a lighting revolution. \"Changing technology makes me feel very clearly that this is as much of a revolution going on now as perhaps when gas went out and electric lighting came in,\" he says. But what is it that makes something beautifully lit, and what role does technological innovation play in illuminating both our buildings and our state of well-being? Major's work - along with his late partner Jonathan Speirs - is award-winning, credited with enhancing the atmosphere of already iconic structures. It is arguably Speirs + Major's most distinctive work, unmissable to Londoners, that displays this like none other: St. Paul's Cathedral. \"It was a great privilege to work on that project,\" he says. \"Probably one of the toughest assignments we've ever had. It took about five years in its execution to design and have the lighting fully delivered.\" The result is a building swathed in soft light - giving the building a sense of serenity in the hustle and bustle of Britain's capital city. Inside, it was an even bigger task. \"When you're dealing with not just a heritage building, but a heritage building of that nature, you realise it was never really designed to be seen under artificial light in quite that way - it would have been seen in candlelight. \"You're placing, in a way, a new interpretation on the building and its architecture after dark, and you have to be very careful how you do that.\" As well as tremendous buildings - Speirs + Major also work with more practical locations such as offices or restaurants, and even our streets. \"On a very basic level,\" Major says, \"Well-designed lighting in the streets of cities doesn't just keep you safe and secure, but also can really help to create a pleasant and interesting atmosphere. \"It can bring out the colour and texture of the landscape, it can sort of direct you to places, it can play a number of different roles in the city that are more than simply enabling us to see - good lighting makes our cities more legible. \"And I hope, as a result, more enjoyable.\" He envisions a future where streets light up as you walk down them, but get dimmer when no-one's around, saving energy. Not only this, but the light can be used to change the very mood of the street depending on the occasion - a delicate skill. \"We all know the difference between a romantic candlelit supper for two, with that soft, warm, glowing light focal that makes your partner look wonderful, and sitting in a fast food restaurant under fluorescent lighting and what a grim experience that can be.\" This type of flexibility would not be possible with traditional filament bulbs. Advancements in light emitting diode (LED) technology means lighting specialists are able to come up with far more complex arrangements. \"We've moved a long way from candles and gaslights,\" Major says. \"LEDs are going to fundamentally revolutionise the way we work with light. \"It's smaller, it's cooler, and the quality of LED lighting has improved so much. Warmer light, broader spectrum, better skin tones, better reproduction of colour - just the overall quality.\" But there are downsides with this revolution, he argues. \"The more light we bring into the world, the greater some of the challenges become. \"Research is beginning to rapidly prove that you can have too much of a good thing - we all know about light pollution.\" And it's not just human beings who would be affected, Major says. \"Many creatures are adapted to the night - so by bringing along a lot of light we can really impact on their feeding habits, on their breeding patterns and all sorts of things. \"So we can enrich our lives, but we have to be quite careful how we work with this industrial material.\"",

        "body": "National Citizen Party chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary on Monday said that the party would only accept lotus as its electoral symbol and the choice must be made by authorities from white lotus, red lotus and lotus. ‘There can be no deviation from this, and if any attempt is made to do so, we will respond accordingly, as we know how to deal with such matters,’ he told reporters after a meeting with the chief election commissioner at the Election Commission office at Agargaon in the capital Dhaka. Nasiruddin said that the discussions with the CEC had focused on three issues — the party’s registration, the demand for the lotus symbol and the voting rights of expatriates. He said that while positive news regarding the party’s registration was expected soon, there were concerns about conspiracies to block the lotus symbol. ‘We are not moving away from the lotus symbol. From our party’s position, we remain firm and we want to make all state institutions aware that the NCP will not compromise on this matter,’ Nasiruddin said. Replying to a question, he said that the NCP had predicted a sweeping victory in the forthcoming national election, claiming that it was on course to win 150 seats, as it pushed forward with plans to consolidate a wider youth-led alliance. Nasirudin said the party was preparing to contest all 300 constituencies, promising ‘a ballot revolution that would reshape the country’s political landscape’. He claimed that the next parliament would exclude both the Awami League and the Jatiya Party, while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, in his projection, would secure no more than 50 to 100 seats. The interim government, which assumed office after the ouster of the authoritarian Awami League regime in a mass uprising past year, suspended the activities of the AL until the trial of party leaders over atrocities during the July uprising. According to Patwary, the NCP has conducted surveys that suggested ‘strong nationwide support’, and it plans to put forward a diverse slate of candidates, including ulema, lawyers, journalists, women, workers, farmers, and former army officers who took part in the mass uprising. Nasiruddin said that the NCP was positioning itself at the head of a new political bloc, separate from both the BNP-led camp and Islamic parties. He explained that a central part of this strategy was the creation of a broader youth alliance, aimed at uniting political groups formed by young people over the past 15 years. Nasirudin mentioned that discussions were under way with the Gono Odhikar Parishad and other parties, which had expressed interest in joining the coalition, although the final arrangements were still under negotiation. He said that the alliance would be built on shared principles rather than seat-sharing deals, with partners required to dissolve their individual party names and symbols in favour of operating under the NCP’s banner.",

        "body": "Rajshahi Correspondent : Rajshahi-2 (Sadar) is one of the most important constituencies in Rajshahi administratively and politically. The constituency, which consists of the entire Rajshahi City Corporation area, is always at the center of discussion. Although former mayor Mizanur Rahman Minu’s clean image and long political experience in local politics give him an additional advantage, there is a strong opposition from the party. On the other hand, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami candidate and Nayeb-e-Amir of the metropolis, Dr. Muhammad Jahangir, has entered the field as a strong opponent. Considering the popularity in the voting field, the strong position of the organization and recent public opinion, there is a hint of a tough fight between the two candidates in this election. Meanwhile, Mobashware Ali, convener of the Rajshahi Metropolitan Committee, has received the nomination of the National Citizens Committee (NCP) in the Rajshahi-2 constituency. After receiving the party nomination, he conducted limited election mass mobilization. Besides, although the names of the candidates of Khilafat Majlis, BSD, Gana Sanghati Andolan and Gana Adhikar Parishad have come to the fore, they have not campaigned.Rajshahi-2 (Sadar) is the most important constituency in Rajshahi administratively and politically among the parliamentary constituencies. Due to the active presence of government and private offices, educational institutions, business and commerce and civil society, the impact of this constituency in national politics is also significant.According to the latest updated data of the Election Commission, the participation of urban educated and middle-class voters in the constituency is relatively high. Young voters, employees, businessmen and women voters play an important role in determining the result here. In addition, this time, civic issues including the July Revolution, party conflicts and the Awami League’s vote bank will play an important role. Due to which, the thirteenth election and the previous elections and subsequent significant events may change the different political trends and issue-based attitudes of the voters.The total number of voters in Rajshahi-2 constituency is 3 lakh 52 thousand 783, of which 1 lakh 71 thousand 418 are male voters and 1 lakh 81 thousand 359 are female voters. There are 8 third gender (hijra) voters. And there are 115 polling stations. The boundaries of the constituency were redrawn before the 1986 elections. And the data analysis shows that BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami had a strong influence on this constituency from the very beginning in the 1990s. Although Awami League played an active role here in the later stage, they were left out of the actual calculation in the controversial election. Meanwhile, in the fifth national parliament election of 1991, BNP’s Kabir Hossain got 43.40 percent of the votes and Jamaat-e-Islami’s candidate Ataur Rahman got 21.50 percent of the votes. In the following year, 2001, Mizanur Rahman Minu got 176,405 votes. At that time, Jamaat supported Minu and ran an overall election campaign.",

        "body": "Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Dr Shafiqur Rahman on Friday said his party would priorities employment generation for young people instead of providing unemployment allowances, stressing that youths should become active builders of the nation rather than recipients of stipends. “We do not want our youths to accept unemployment allowances from anyone. We want to turn every young hand into a hand that builds the country,” he told the central members’ conference of Islami Chhatrashibir as the chief guest at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre (BCFCC). Dr Shafiqur said Jamaat-e-Islami would work in unity with people of all classes to build a humane and discrimination-free Bangladesh. “We want to place work in every hand, strength in every heart and the message of revolution on the lips of our youths. Not unemployment allowance, but youths themselves will bring revolution in every sector of this country,” he added.Calling upon young people to prepare themselves, the Jamaat Ameer said, “You will succeed, Insha Allah. We are with you.” Highlighting the party’s vision for education, Dr Shafiqur said Jamaat wants to establish an education system that would help students become complete human beings, reach the highest standard of learning, develop strong moral character and acquire technical skills so that no young man or woman remains unemployed, reports BSS. Referring to Chhatrashibir’s recent victories in different student unions, he said the youths now carry the responsibility of 180 million people. “May Allah make this burden easier for you and grant you the strength to bear it. These victories indicate that the victory of justice will come to Bangladesh, Insha Allah,” he said. “Students voted for Chhatrashibir as a symbol of justice in educational institutions, not for any other reason,” he added. The Jamaat chief also said his party wants to establish justice in the country, noting that Bangladesh is currently facing an acute shortage of justice. “The foundation of justice is the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Justice has never been established anywhere in the world by abandoning the Quran and Sunnah,” he said. Dr Shafiqur reiterated Jamaat-e-Islami’s commitment to restoring peace and discipline in people’s lives in line with divine guidance and to building a corruption-free, discrimination-free and justice-based humane Bangladesh. The day-long conference is being attended by members from across the country. The first session began at 8am with the recitation of the Holy Quran, followed by the inaugural declaration and opening remarks. The first session concluded at 1pm after speeches by invited guests, while the closing session began at 2pm after a short break.",

        "title": "Current account remains positive in July",
        "body": "Bangladesh’s current account balance remained positive in July, first month of the financial year 2025-26 driven by a surge in remittance inflows and export earnings, alongside sluggish import growth reflecting weak investment demand. According to the latest data from the Bangladesh Bank, the current account posted a surplus of $245 million in July from that of $181 million deficit recorded in July, 2024. It was $981 million surplus in FY25, a dramatic turnaround from the $6.6 billion deficit in FY24. The last time the country saw a current account surplus in FY16, when it stood at $4.26 billion. Since then, persistent deficits continued for eight consecutive fiscal years until this reversal. The current account is a vital part of a country’s balance of payments (BoP), reflecting the net flow of goods, services, primary income (such as interest and dividends), and secondary income (mainly remittances). In July last year, business activities and financial transactions came to standstill due to month wide protests and shut down which led to fall of Awami League led government on August 5, 2024. A surge in remittance inflows and robust export earnings contributed to the reversal of the current account balance. The improvement in current account came primarily from a surge in secondary income, which includes remittances sent by Bangladeshi workers abroad. Remittance inflows jumped by nearly 29.5 per cent to $2.47 billion in July from $1.91 billion in the previous fiscal year. Overall secondary income rose to $2.52 billion, up from $1.95 billion in July last year. Export earnings also contributed positively, growing by 27 per cent year-on-year to reach $4.4 billion in July. However, the other indicators in the balance of payment, including trade deficit and financial account showed negative output in July. As import payments surged by 24.7 per cent, the trade deficit rose to $1.5 billion from $1.46 billion a year earlier. Moreover, the deficit in services trade rose to $482 million, down from $338 million in July last year, reflecting poor performance in sectors like IT services and transport. Despite the positive remittance trend, the country continued to post a deficit in its primary income account. This segment includes payments to foreign investors for interest, dividends, and compensation of foreign workers. The deficit in this category declined to $291 million, with $502 million in payments made abroad while income received totaled only $211 million. Despite the gains in current account and exports, the financial account of the BoP posted deficit of $718 million in July, compared with $263 million in July last year. As a result of these developments, the overall balance of payments hit deficit of $545 million in July compared with that of $693 million in July last year. As of July 24, 2025, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $25 billion, based on the IMF’s updated calculation methodology.",

US ambassador Mike Waltz shared the draft with the 10 elected members of the Security Council and several regional partners — Egypt, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Turkey — a spokesperson for the US mission said in a statement. No date has been set to vote on the draft. The US statement said the resolution ‘welcomes the Board of Peace,’ a transitional governing body for Gaza envisioned in Trump’s 20-point plan, which he would chair. It also ‘authorises the International Stabilisation Force’ outlined in the peace plan. According to diplomatic sources, several countries have indicated their willingness to participate in the ISF, but insist on a Security Council mandate before actually deploying troops into the Palestinian territory. ‘Under president Trump’s bold leadership, the United States will again deliver results at the UN — not endless talk,’ the US spokesperson said. The creation of the international force was one part of the agreement that led to the fragile October 10 ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, following two years of devastating violence triggered by the October 7 attack. Under the terms of the deal, troops would be drawn from mostly Arab and Muslim countries and deployed to Gaza to oversee security as the Israeli army withdraws. ‘The parties have seized this historic opportunity to finally end decades of bloodshed and make the president’s vision of lasting peace in the Middle East a reality,’ the US spokesperson added. Subsequent phases of Trump’s plan include further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the decimated territory.",

        "body": "A case has been filed against 13 individuals, including 10 officials of the July Shaheed Smrity Foundation, on charges of torturing a couple during an interrogation related to the July Uprising. Sabina Yasmin, one of the alleged victims, lodged the complaint with the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, said her lawyer, Md Zakir Hossain. After recording her statement, Metropolitan Magistrate Ariful Islam directed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to probe the allegations and submit a report by November 11. The accused foundation officials are senior verification officer Iftikhar Hossain, officers Sagar, Mehedi Hasan Prince, Afzalu Rahman Sayem, Saidur Rahman Shahid, Fatema Afrin Payel, Reza Tanvir, Alif, and Jahid, and executive member Sabrina Afroz Srabonti. The other accused are Sonia Akhter Lubna, Rakin, and Shamim Reza Khan, whose designations could not be known immediately. According to the case statement, during the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement on July 19, 2024, Sabina’s husband, Bulbul Sikder, sustained a severe leg injury, while their son suffered a severed nerve in his leg on the Dhaka–Chittagong Road. Following the fall of the Awami League government, the couple visited the foundation’s office on March 20 this year seeking recognition and compensation as July Uprising victims. There, Iftikhar and several others allegedly interrogated them, took Bulbul to a separate room, and tortured him for hours. Sabina was also reportedly beaten and threatened. The accused branded them as ‘fake July warriors,’ tried to force false confessions, and seized Sabina’s bag and mobile phone, the complaint said. Bulbul later suffered mental trauma and required medical treatment. Responding to the allegations, the foundation’s chief executive officer, Kamal Akbar, told New Age that Sabina and Bulbul had been accused of paying a woman from Narayanganj to include Bulbul as a ‘July warrior.’ He said the woman was earlier jailed in a case filed by the foundation for endorsing fake July warriors and had recently been released on bail. ‘Sabina and her husband came to the foundation on March 20, and some July warriors protested after learning about the allegation. One of our officials, Shahid, helped them leave the office safely,’ Kamal said. ‘I don’t know why the case was filed six months after the incident. The CID can investigate, and if anyone is found guilty, the foundation will not shield them. All the accused are dedicated officials,’ he added. The July Shaheed Smrity Foundation was launched on September 17, 2024, with an initial fund of Tk 100 crore from the Chief Adviser’s Relief and Welfare Fund to support victims of the July Uprising.",

        "body": "The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution has emphasised on integrated efforts among government, private sectors, and consumers to ensure the production of quality products, prevent counterfeit and substandard goods, and maintain international standards. The call was made at a discussion meeting organised in the capital’s Krishibid Institution on Tuesday marking World Standards Day 2025. The Day is being observed this year under the theme ‘A Shared Vision for a Better World: Standards for Sustainable Development’. Industries secretary Md Obaidur Rahman attended the event as the chief guest while BSTI Director General SM Ferdous Alam chaired the session. Among others, former secretary and president of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh AHM Shafiquzzaman, chairman and CEO of PRAN-RFL Group Ahsan Khan Chowdhury and FBCCI’s head of international affairs Md Zafar Iqbal were present. The keynote paper was presented by Professor Abdul Hasib Chowdhury, pro-vice chancellor of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. In his address, Industries Secretary Md. Obaidur Rahman said that ensuring quality standards is not the lone responsibility of an institution alone, rather it requires joint efforts from producers, regulators, and consumers. ‘BSTI has evolved into a globally recognized institution in many areas. It now houses several laboratories, including the National Halal Laboratory, that meet international standards,’ he said urging the businesses to maintain quality even after obtaining BSTI licenses. Calling upon entrepreneurs, he said, ‘Ethical production and marketing of quality goods must continue throughout the year-not just during Ramadan. Many countries reduce product prices during festivals, but we fail to do so....’ Addressing journalists, he said, ‘Your writings and reports can play a crucial role in raising awareness about quality standards. We encourage you to inform the public about BSTI’s activities.’ Obaidur further stated, ‘The government’s role is not to run businesses but to ensure proper policy and supervision. We want entrepreneurs to take the lead in improving quality so that Bangladesh becomes globally competitive.’ CAB president AHM Shafiquzzaman said that according to the Allocation of Business, it is BSTI’s mandate to issue Halal certifications, and it already has an internationally accredited Halal Laboratory. ‘If we can properly promote halal certification, Bangladesh’s halal exports could reach billion of dollars by 2030,’ he added. He also urged BSTI to take stricter measures against counterfeit and adulterated products. PRAN-RFL Group chairman Ahsan Khan Chowdhury noted that BSTI has undergone remarkable improvements in recent years and has become a symbol of quality practice in Bangladesh. He said, ‘We, the business community, wish to take advantage of BSTI’s modern laboratory facilities.’ He also requested BSTI to focus on Halal Laboratory accreditation, formulation of new standards, simplification of standardization procedures, and harmonization with international standards. BSTI director general SM Ferdous Alam emphasised adherence to international standards to ensure consumer protection and competitiveness, saying, ‘Countries strictly test and analyze products before accepting them for import. Therefore, we must align our supply chain with global quality benchmarks.’ He warned that counterfeit and substandard products, especially in cosmetics and food, pose serious health hazards. ‘In recent drives, some cosmetics were found to contain hydroquinone levels thousands of times higher than permitted, posing long-term risks to kidneys, liver, and overall health, particularly for adolescent girls and pregnant women,’ he said, urging coordinated action from law enforcement and consumer protection agencies. Highlighting BSTI’s recent development activities, Ferdous said that the BSTI has introduced QR-coded online licenses to prevent forgery and illegal use of standard marks, established the National Halal Laboratory, Helmet Testing Laboratory, Solar Panel Testing Laboratory, and Cement Testing Laboratory, and installed advanced equipment for gold purity certification. He added that BSTI has also launched 10 new regional offices to strengthen institutional capacity and is expanding its testing parameters to include more products in line with international standards. Government and private sector officials, business representatives and members of the media attended the event.",

Looking ahead, Alam said, Bangladesh will be able successfully negotiate even greater tariff reductions from the United States as the trade gap shrinks. ‘Our garment exporters already have the capacity to purchase the entirety of US cotton exports. Once we establish ourselves as a key US trading partner, we will have no need to engage costly lobby groups in Washington — we will have the US farm lobby, which has considerable political strength, to advocate for us with US governmental entities,’ he said. ‘Japan, China, Southeast Asian nations, and Western European countries have all prospered through robust trade with the United States. Now, we too can follow that path,’ Alam said in a message shared from his verified Facebook account. A few months after Khalilur Rahman was appointed as the high representative on Rohingya affairs and later as national security adviser, chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus sent him to Washington DC in February to build ties with the new US administration. Khalil, a veteran career diplomat and an eminent economist who spent decades at a senior level at a UN organisation specialising in global trade policy, quickly connected with key figures in the American agricultural sector, he said. Alam said Bangladesh is a major importer of agricultural products, while the US is one of the world’s largest exporters of soybeans, wheat, cotton, and corn. ‘Access to US agricultural market is potentially a crucial aspect of our food security, which is one of our key national security concerns,’ he said. It also would allow us to diversify food import sources and thereby to avoid potential situations where certain sourcing countries might weaponise our food dependence on them. Khalil helped strengthen the bridge between Bangladeshi importers and the US farm lobby — a relationship that played a crucial role in our successful recent tariff negotiations with Washington. ‘Besides, his successful efforts as our lead negotiator contributed to securing competitive tariff rates that have effectively safeguarded Bangladesh’s garment industry,’ Alam said. Earlier this week, Bangladeshi importers pledged to purchase over one billion dollars’ worth of US farm products — a ‘win-win outcome’ for both countries and a milestone in Bangladesh-US relations, said the press secretary. With China sourcing most of its soybeans from Brazil, Bangladesh can, in a meaningful way, help fill the gap left by Chinese importers, he said. This growing agricultural trade partnership, Alam said, is now taking center stage in the two nations’ diplomatic engagement, a vision championed by the interim government.",

        "body": "Metro rail services on the Uttara-Motijheel route fully resumed on Monday after a nearly 23-hour halt following the death of a pedestrian caused by a bearing pad that fell on him after it had been dislodged from the metro rail structure. Wife of the victim Abul Kalam Azad on Sunday night filed an unnatural death case. Same night the authorities also revised the probe committee by placing it under the supervision of special assistant to the chief adviser Sheik Moinuddin following criticism over the committee’s composition. One more member has also been incorporated in the committee. Abul Kalam Azad was killed and two others were injured as a bearing pad fell from the metro rail structure on the Khamar Bari road in Dhaka’s Farmgate area at about 12:30pm Sunday, halting the metro services for hours. The services resumed on the Uttara-Agargaon section after two and a half hours and on the Motijheel-Shahbagh section after seven hours on Sunday. Repair work started in the metro rail’s Farmgate station area on Sunday. Officials of Dhaka Mass Transport Company Limited, the implementing agency of metro rail, said that on Monday morning new bearing pad had been installed on the Pier 433 from where the bearing pad was dislodged. Pier 433 sits near the entrance of the Farmgate metro station. Bearing pad falling occurred earlier also. In 2024, bearing pad dropped from Pier 430. After installing new pad on Monday, metro trains ran on trial basis. Later, services on the Bijoy Sarani-Karwan Bazar section resumed at about 11:00am. Ireen Akhtar Piya, wife of the victim Abul Kalam Azad on Sunday night filed an unnatural death case with the Tejgaon police, said its officer-in-charge Md Mobarak Hossain. Abul Kalam Azad was buried on Monday in his village at Noria upazila of Shariatpur after his second namaz-e-janaza. His first nama-e-janaza was held at Chashara in Narayanganj where he lived with his wife and two children. Soon after the accident, the interim government’s road transport and bridges ministry adviser, Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, on Sunday said that they had formed a five-member probe committee to investigate the incident and submit its report within two weeks. Making Bridges Division secretary Mohammad Abdur Rouf Criticism head of the probe committee sparked anger as he had previously served as the managing director of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited and when he was at the helm of the company a bearing pad dropped from another pier in 2024. The road transport ministry on Sunday night revised the committee by keeping Abdur Rouf as committee head, while tasking special assistant to the chief adviser Sheik Moinuddin to supervise the committee. Member secretary of the committee is Road Transport Highways Division deputy secretary Asfia Sultana and its members are—Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology’s mechanical engineering professor ABM Toufique Hasan, Local Government Engineering Department chief engineer, Military Institute of Science and Technology’s associate professor for civil engineering Lieutenant Colonel Md Jahidul Islam, and director of Mass Rapid Transit line 6 project, popularly known as metro rail, retired Brigadier General Md Abdul Wohab.",

        "body": "The announcement of the national election schedule has brought widespread enthusiasm among citizens, despite a compressed timeframe that has kept political actors and stakeholders busy. Even so, the election atmosphere is gradually taking on a festive tone, speakers observed at a strategic communication workshop organized by the Alliance for Fair Election and Democracy (AFED). The two-day workshop, titled “Communication Strategies for Citizen Election Observers,” began on Sunday at the BRAC Learning Centre in Niketon, Gulshan. Participants emphasized the urgent need to ensure adequate security for citizen election observers, noting that observers often face intimidation or uncooperative behavior from candidates and their supporters. Speakers suggested that assigning armed guards to observers would be ideal. However, if that is not feasible, they stressed the importance of deploying visible security personnel to ensure observers can carry out their duties safely and independently. “Observer security is essential for a credible and transparent election,” participants noted. The workshop also focused on strengthening AFED’s internal and public communication mechanisms. Sessions addressed principles of credible communication, internal workflows, joint public messaging, proactive outreach, and the selection of a designated spokesperson. Key outcomes included agreement on a unified tagline, joint communication tools, and a mechanism for sharing election-related information among member organizations. The opening session was chaired by AFED board members, while technical sessions were introduced by Mette Bakken and Anastasia Wibawa. A number of civil society leaders attended, including Rebeya Begum of SDS, Mahbubur Rahman of Banchte Shekha, Taleya Rehman of Democracywatch, and representatives from DORP, FEMA, MSK, and other organizations. The workshop will conclude on December 15 with follow-up discussions and closing remarks by AFED board members.",

        "body": "National Citizen Party member secretary Akhter Hossen on Saturday said that if the legal basis, draft order, and contents of the July National Charter’s implementation road map were not presented before the nation, the charter would remain nothing more than a paper. He made the remark while speaking to journalists after a meeting with the National Consensus Commission at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban. Akhter said, ‘We have clearly told the commission that the order for implementing the July Charter must be made public. Otherwise, we will not consider it for signing.’ NCP refrained from signing the Charter on October 17 when 24 parties, the consensus commission and chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus signed the document. Although appreciating the commission for drafting the July Charter Implementation (Reforms of Constitution) Order, Akhter said that the document must be made public before issuance. ‘We do not see the charter merely as a political document. It represents the sovereign will of the people. The chief adviser should issue the order,’ Akhter said. He further said that his party had recommended that the Jatiya Sangsad should pass the proposed reforms outlined in the charter and declare it the ‘2026 Reformed Constitution’. He demanded that the implementation of the July Charter must not be designed to serve any particular party’s interests. Explaining why the NCP did not sign the charter, he said that his party believed that signing the July Charter was merely a formality. ‘Without implementation, the endorsement has no meaning.’ Regarding the political alliance issue, he said, ‘So far, we have not started any formal discussions with any party about forming an electoral alliance. However, if national interest demands it, we remain open to that possibility.’ Other NCP leaders Sarwar Tusher, Javed Rasin, Khaled Saifullah and Jahirul Islam Musa were also present.",

যদি কোটা আন্দোলনের মাধ্যমে তা না করা যেত, তবে সেটা হতো অন্য কোনো ইস্যুতে। কোটাবিরোধী আন্দোলনকে তাই কেন্দ্রবিন্দু না বলে, বরং হাসিনাবিরোধী আন্দোলনের প্রবেশপথ বললেই হয়তো বেশি যথার্থ হবে। দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে এমনই এক প্রবেশপথের জন্য ছাত্ররা অপেক্ষা করছিলেন ও প্রস্তুত হচ্ছিলেন। এসব কর্মী নিজেদের লক্ষ্য স্থির করেছিলেন ২০২৬ সালকে কেন্দ্র করে। কিন্তু পরিস্থিত এর আগেই তাঁদের এনে দেয় মোক্ষম সুযোগ, যেটা তাঁরা গ্রহণ করতেও ভুল করেননি।তবে তাঁরা (আন্দোলনকারীরা) পুরোটা সময় নিজেদের রাজনৈতিকভাবে স্বতন্ত্র হিসেবে পরিচিত করান। এর কারণ হলো, সরকার যেন তাঁদের আন্দোলনকে বিএনপি বা জামায়াতের আন্দোলন বলে নামাঙ্কিত করতে না পারে এবং সেই সুযোগে তাঁদের নির্বিচার দমন করতে না পারে। একই সঙ্গে তাঁদের পরিকল্পিত রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পও তাঁরা অনেকটা অপ্রকাশ্য রেখেই কোটার ইস্যুকে কাজে লাগিয়ে প্রাথমিক প্রতিরোধ গড়ে তোলেন। এই কৌশলগত সিদ্ধান্তকে আমি বলছি, ‘কৌশলী অরাজনৈতিকতা’। আন্দোলনের পর অনেক নেতাই তাঁদের রাজনৈতিক পরিচয় বা প্রকল্প প্রকাশ্য এনেছেন, আন্দোলনে কার কতটা অবদান, তা নিয়ে বাগ্‌বিতণ্ডায় লিপ্ত হয়েছেন। তবে আন্দোলনের সময় আন্দোলনের স্বার্থেই তাঁরা নীরবতা বজায় রেখেছিলেন। গুরত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হলো, বাইরে থেকে নিজেদের অরাজনৈতিক দেখানোর চেষ্টা করলেও, আদতে এই আন্দোলন ছিল পুরোপুরি রাজনৈতিক। তাঁদের একটি রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্প বরাবরই ছিল আর সেটাই অপরাপর বৃহৎ ছাত্র আন্দোলনের সঙ্গে এর পার্থক্য তৈরি করেছে। এই রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পের বর্তমান বাস্তবায়িত রূপ হলো জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টি (এনসিপি)। তবে কেবল ভোটের রাজনীতি নয়, বরং একটি পরিপূর্ণ ‘বিপ্লব’ ঘটানোর জন্যই এ আন্দোলনকারীরা ছিলেন চিরপ্রস্তুত। তাঁদের মধ্যে ছিল বৈপ্লবিক আকাঙ্ক্ষা, বৈপ্লবিক ঐকমত্য ও তাঁরা গড়ে তুলেছিলেন একটি বৈপ্লবিক জোট। একটি বৈপ্লবিক মুহূর্তও তাঁদের হাতে ধরা দিয়েছিল, যেটিকে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক পরিণতির দিকে নিয়ে যেতে পারতেন। নানা চাপের কারণে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক সমাধানের বদলে ‘মধ্যপন্থা’ বেছে নিয়েছেন এবং প্রমাণ করেছন যে মধ্যপন্থা মানে কেবল মাঝামাঝি অবস্থান করা নয়, অনেক সময় মিডিওক্রিটি বা মধ্যম মান বেছে নেওয়া। জুলাইয়ের আন্দোলনের একটা অন্যতম মূল চালিকা শক্তি ছিলেন এমন মানুষেরা, যাঁরা প্রকৃতপক্ষেই অরাজনৈতিক। এঁদের অনেকে কোনো প্রতিষ্ঠিত রাজনৈতিক দলকেই সমর্থন করেননি, তবে আওয়ামী লীগের শাসনে তাঁরা ত্যক্ত–বিরক্ত ছিলেন। অনেকে আওয়ামী লীগকে সমর্থন করলেও বিপুলসংখ্যক হতাহতের ঘটনা দেখে তাঁদের অবস্থানও বদলে গিয়েছিল। এই মানুষদের ভোট এনসিপি টানতে পারবে কি না, সেটা এখন একটা দেখার বিষয়। এই মুহূর্তে যাঁরা এনসিপিতে আছেন, তাঁদের অনেকে জুলাইয়ের ছাত্র নেতৃত্ব হলেও, আন্দোলনকারীদের একটা বড় অংশের অংশগ্রহণ এখানে অনুপস্থিত। আন্দোলনের শেষে একটা বড় অংশ ঘরে ফিরে গেছে। সেই ছাত্র–জনতা কোনো দলে যুক্ত হতে বা ক্ষমতার ভাগীদার হতেও আগ্রহী নন। এই মানুষগুলোকে আমি আমার ২০১৮ সালে প্রকাশিত এক গবেষণাপত্রে অভিহিত করেছিলাম বাংলাদেশি রাজনীতির ‘তৃতীয় শক্তি’ হিসেবে। এখন এই তৃতীয় শক্তির ভোট কারা সবচেয়ে সফলভাবে টানতে পারবে, সেটাই দেখার বিষয়। তবে দুঃখের বিষয় এই যে আমার ধারণা, নানা কারণে এনসিপি এই ভোটের একটা বড় অংশকেই এরই মধ্যে হারিয়ে ফেলেছে। জুলাইয়ের যে সাংগঠনিক কাঠামো, যে ‘যুক্তফ্রন্ট’ ছিল, সেটাকে ভেঙে এখন কেন্দ্রীভূত রাজনীতি করার চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। বিভিন্ন রাজনৈতিক মিত্র, যেমন বামপন্থীদের দূরে ঠেলে দেওয়া হয়েছে। কেন্দ্রীয় নিয়ন্ত্রণের রাজনীতি ধীরে ধীরে প্রকাশ হচ্ছে। এতে সাংগঠনিক শক্তি দুর্বল হচ্ছে। এনসিপির পদযাত্রায়, পথসভায় যতই ‘মানুষের ঢল’ দেখা যাক, সাংগঠনিক ক্ষমতাকে আরও শক্তিশালী করতে না পারলে এই দল দাঁড়াবে না। এনসিপির উচিত জুলাইয়ের স্মরণে হলেও তাঁদের আশপাশের অপরাপর গোষ্ঠী, দল, সংগঠনকে নিয়ে একটা বড় মৈত্রী গড়ে তোলা, যাতে সংগঠন শক্তিশালী হয়। জুলাই থেকে এই শিক্ষা নিতে না পারলে রাজনৈতিকভাবে এনসিপি হোঁচট খেতে পারে। জুলাইয়ের কান্ডারি হতে চাইলে এনসিপিকে জুলাই থেকেই শিক্ষা নিতে হবে। অনুপম দেবাশীষ রায় ইউনিভার্সিটি অব অক্সফোর্ডের ডিফিল (পিএইচডি) গবেষক।ই–মেইল: [email protected]",

        "body": "দেশে গত ১৩ বছরের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি হয়েছে জুলাই মাসে। শিক্ষার্থীদের কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মাসটিতে মূল্যস্ফীতি দুই অঙ্কের ঘর ছাড়িয়ে যায়। সরকার পরিবর্তনের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে বাংলাদেশ পরিসংখ্যান ব্যুরোর (বিবিএস) হিসাবে মূল্যস্ফীতিও যেন লাফ দিয়ে বেড়ে গেছে। এত দিন ধরে মূল্যস্ফীতির হিসাব নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলে আসছিলেন অর্থনীতিবিদেরা। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, গত জুলাই মাসে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে দাঁড়ায় ১১ দশমিক ৬৬ শতাংশ। গত জুন মাসে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ৯ দশমিক ৭২ শতাংশ। অন্যদিকে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি জুলাই মাসে বেড়ে ১৪ শতাংশ ছাড়াল। যা গত ১৩ বছরের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ। গতকাল সোমবার বিবিএস জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতির হালনাগাদ তথ্য প্রকাশ করেছে। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, এর আগে ২০১১ সালের সেপ্টেম্বরে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল সর্বোচ্চ ১১ দশমিক ৯৭ শতাংশ। এরপর গত জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতি সর্বোচ্চ। কয়েক বছর ধরে বিবিএসের মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য নিয়ে শঙ্কা প্রকাশ করে আসছেন অর্থনীতিবিদেরা। তাঁরা বলছেন, সরকারি পরিসংখ্যানে মূল্যস্ফীতির যে হিসাব দেওয়া হচ্ছে, বাস্তবে সেটি আরও বেশি। সরকার মূল্যস্ফীতি কমিয়ে দেখাচ্ছে। অর্থনীতিবিদদের এ অবিশ্বাসের মধ্যেও এক বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি সাড়ে ৯ শতাংশের বেশি। বেসরকারি গবেষণা সংস্থা সাউথ এশিয়ান নেটওয়ার্ক অন ইকোনমিক মডেলিংয়ের (সানেম) নির্বাহী পরিচালক সেলিম রায়হান প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, এত দিন শঙ্কা ছিল মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য কমিয়ে দেখানো হচ্ছে। রাজনৈতিক সুবিধা নেওয়ার জন্য হয়তো এটা করা হয়েছিল। কারণ বাজারের জিনিসপত্রের দামের সঙ্গে মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য মিলছিল না। এখন রাজনৈতিক সরকার নেই। তাই মূল্যস্ফীতির প্রকৃত চিত্র বেরিয়ে আসতে শুরু করেছে। জুলাই মাসে পণ্য সরবরাহব্যবস্থা মারাত্মকভাবে বিঘ্নিত হয়। এর প্রতিফলনও দেখা গেছে মূল্যস্ফীতির হিসাবে। মূল্যস্ফীতি হলো একধরনের করের মতো, যা ধনী-গরিব নির্বিশেষ সবার ওপর চাপ বাড়ায়। গত জুলাই মাসে ১১ দশমিক ৬৬ শতাংশ মূল্যস্ফীতি হওয়ার মানে হলো, ২০২৩ সালের জুলাই মাসে একজন মানুষ যে পণ্য ১০০ টাকায় কিনেছেন, চলতি বছরের জুলাই মাসে একই পণ্য ও সেবা কিনতে তাঁর খরচ হয়েছে ১১১ টাকা ৬৬ পয়সা। অর্থাৎ এক বছরের ব্যবধানে প্রতি ১০০ টাকায় খরচ বেড়েছে ১১ টাকা ৬৬ পয়সা। এ বিষয়ে জানতে চাইলে বিবিএসের একজন ঊর্ধ্বতন কর্মকর্তা নাম প্রকাশ না করার শর্তে প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, সারা দেশের ১৫৪টি বাজার থেকে তথ্য–উপাত্ত অনলাইনে সংগ্রহ করে জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতি গণনা করা হয়েছে। গত মাসে পণ্য সরবরাহব্যবস্থা বিঘ্নিত হওয়ায় হঠাৎ মূল্যস্ফীতির হার বেড়ে থাকতে পারে। ১৩ বছরে সর্বোচ্চ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বিবিএসের তথ্য অনুযায়ী, গত জুলাই মাসে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে ১৪ দশমিক ১০ শতাংশে। জুনে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ১০ দশমিক ৪২ শতাংশ। এক মাসের ব্যবধানে হঠাৎ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেশ খানিকটা বেড়ে গেছে। জুলাইয়ে যে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি দাঁড়িয়েছে, তা গত ১৩ বছর ৪ মাস বা ১৬০ মাসের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ। এর আগে সর্বশেষ সর্বোচ্চ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ২০১১ সালের এপ্রিলে, ১৪ দশমিক ৩৬ শতাংশ। এরপর আর কখনো খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ১৪ শতাংশে ওঠেনি। খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে যাওয়া প্রসঙ্গে সানেমের নির্বাহী পরিচালক সেলিম রায়হান বলেন, এত খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি অসম্ভব উদ্বেগের বিষয়। এ অবস্থায় গরিব মানুষকে সুরক্ষা দিতে পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া জরুরি হয়ে পড়েছে। গত কয়েক সপ্তাহের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতা ও নিরাপত্তাহীনতায় গরিব ও সীমিত আয়ের মানুষের কর্মসংস্থান আরও সংকুচিত হয়েছে। তাঁদের আয় কমেছে। তাতে আরও বেশি চাপে পড়েছেন খেটে খাওয়া মানুষেরা। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, খাদ্যবহির্ভূত মূল্যস্ফীতিও বেড়েছে। গত জুলাইয়ে খাদ্যবহির্ভূত মূল্যস্ফীতির হার বেড়ে দাঁড়ায় ৯ দশমিক ৬৮ শতাংশে। জুনে এই হার ছিল ৯ দশমিক ১৫ শতাংশ। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলছেন, উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণই এখন অর্থনীতির বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। এক বছর ধরে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে আছে। আয় বৃদ্ধির তুলনায় মূল্যস্ফীতি বেশি বেড়ে গেলে গরিব ও মধ্যবিত্তের সংসার চালাতে ভোগান্তি বাড়ে। এমনিতে বাজারের জিনিসপত্রের দাম বেশ চড়া। তার সঙ্গে চিকিৎসা, পরিবহনসহ খাদ্যবহির্ভূত খাতেও খরচ বেড়ে গেছে। সব মিলিয়ে মূল্যস্ফীতির চাপ সামাল দিতে হিমশিম খাচ্ছেন মানুষ।",

        "body": "২০২৫ সালের শেষ মাসটি ছিল বেশ হতাশাজনক। নির্বিচার গুলি, নানা সংকট আর তীব্র মেরুকরণের খবরের শিরোনামে সংবাদমাধ্যম ভরা ছিল। তবু এ অন্ধকার সময়ের মধ্যেও একটি ইতিবাচক পরিবর্তন ভবিষ্যতের জন্য আশার ইঙ্গিত দিচ্ছে। উন্নয়নশীল বিশ্বের নানা দেশে তরুণ প্রজন্ম এখন জোরালোভাবে চাকরি, সাশ্রয়ী খাদ্য ও জ্বালানি, অর্থনৈতিক সুযোগ ও জলবায়ু পরিবর্তন মোকাবিলায় কার্যকর পদক্ষেপের দাবি তুলছে। দক্ষিণ এশিয়া থেকে লাতিন আমেরিকা পর্যন্ত তারা রাজনৈতিক নেতৃত্বের সামনে পরিষ্কার একটি বার্তা দিচ্ছে, ‘শুনুন ও ব্যবস্থা নিন, নইলে সরে দাঁড়ান।’ নেপাল এর একটি স্পষ্ট উদাহরণ। গত সেপ্টেম্বরে দেশটির সরকার ২৬টি বড় সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যম নিষিদ্ধ করে। এসব প্ল্যাটফর্মে রাজনীতিবিদদের সন্তানদের বিলাসী জীবনযাপন নিয়ে তথ্য প্রকাশ পাচ্ছিল। ফলে দুর্নীতি, স্বজনপ্রীতি ও তরুণদের জন্য সুযোগের অভাব নিয়ে ব্যাপক বিক্ষোভ শুরু হয়। ৭৩ বছর বয়সী প্রধানমন্ত্রী কে পি শর্মা ওলি পরিস্থিতি সামলানোর বদলে রাস্তায় নামা হাজারো কিশোর-তরুণকে নিয়ে বিদ্রূপ করেন। নিরাপত্তা বাহিনীর গুলিতে অন্তত ১৯ জন নিহত ও শতাধিক মানুষ আহত হলে বিক্ষোভকারীরা পার্লামেন্ট ভবনে আগুন দেন এবং ওলির ব্যক্তিগত বাসভবনে হামলা চালান। পরদিনই তিনি পদত্যাগ করেন। অনেকে মনে করেন, এ আন্দোলনের ঢেউ শুরু হয়েছিল ২০২২ সালে শ্রীলঙ্কায়। সে সময় দেশটি ভয়াবহ অর্থনৈতিক বিপর্যয়ে পড়ে। জ্বালানি ও বিদ্যুতের তীব্র সংকটে তরুণদের নেতৃত্বে বড় আন্দোলন গড়ে ওঠে। তাঁরা তৎকালীন ৭২ বছর বয়সী প্রেসিডেন্ট গোতাবায়া রাজাপক্ষের কার্যালয়ের সামনে ক্যাম্প স্থাপন করেন। অভিযোগ ছিল, দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ক্ষমতায় থাকা তাঁর পরিবার দুর্নীতি ও স্বজনপ্রীতিতে জড়িত। একপর্যায়ে বিক্ষোভকারীরা প্রেসিডেন্টের বাসভবনে ঢুকে পড়লে গোতাবায়াকে দেশ ছেড়ে পালাতে হয়। এর দুই বছর পর বাংলাদেশে শিক্ষার্থীরা চাকরিতে কোটা সংস্কারের দাবিতে আন্দোলনে নামেন। সরকার তখন টেলিযোগাযোগ বন্ধ করে দেয় এবং কঠোর পুলিশি দমন চালায়। এতে শত শত সাধারণ মানুষ নিহত হন। কিন্তু এ সহিংসতা আন্দোলন দমন করতে পারেনি; বরং আরও হাজার হাজার মানুষ এতে যুক্ত হন। ঢাকায় বিক্ষোভকারীরা দ্রুত তৎকালীন ৭৬ বছর বয়সী প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার কার্যালয় ও বাসভবনের দিকে মিছিল বের করেন। এর পরপরই তিনি ভারতে পালিয়ে যান। প্রায় একই সময়ে কেনিয়ায় প্রেসিডেন্ট উইলিয়াম রুটোর প্রস্তাবিত কর বৃদ্ধির বিরুদ্ধে জেন–জির নেতৃত্বাধীন আন্দোলন ছড়িয়ে পড়ে। নিরাপত্তা বাহিনীর গুলিতে কয়েক ডজন মানুষ নিহত হন, শতাধিক আহত হন এবং অনেককে বিনা কারণে আটক করা হয়। বিক্ষোভকারীরা সংসদ ভবনে ঢুকে আগুন দিলে রুটো কর বৃদ্ধি প্রত্যাহার করেন এবং তাঁর মন্ত্রিসভার অধিকাংশ সদস্যকে বরখাস্ত করেন। চলতি বছরের জুনে আবারও বিক্ষোভ শুরু হয়, যা জনরোষের গভীরতা স্পষ্ট করে। এদিকে পেরুতে পেনশন সংস্কারের বিরুদ্ধে আন্দোলন ধীরে ধীরে বিস্তৃত হয়ে ওঠে। মানুষ অর্থনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তা ও ব্যাপক দুর্নীতির বিরুদ্ধে আওয়াজ তোলে। দমন-পীড়ন পরিস্থিতিকে আরও উত্তপ্ত করে তোলে। শেষ পর্যন্ত ঘুষ কেলেঙ্কারিতে তদন্তাধীন প্রেসিডেন্ট দিনা বলুয়ার্তেকে ক্ষমতা থেকে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়। দেশে দেশে দেখা গেছে, জেন–জির নেতৃত্বাধীন এই আন্দোলনগুলো খুব দ্রুত সাধারণ মানুষের ব্যাপক সমর্থন পেয়েছে। তরুণেরা সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যম ব্যবহার করে তথ্য ছড়িয়েছেন, সংগঠন গড়েছেন এবং নেটওয়ার্ক তৈরি করেছেন। সরকার যখন এসব মাধ্যম বন্ধ করেছে, তখন তাঁরা এনক্রিপটেড সার্ভার, এমনকি অনলাইন গেমিং প্ল্যাটফর্মেও সংগঠিত হয়েছেন। আর রাষ্ট্রীয় সহিংসতার মুখে তাঁরা পিছু হটেননি; বরং আন্দোলন আরও জোরালো করেছেন। এ আন্দোলন শুধু একটি প্রজন্ম বা একটি অঞ্চলে সীমাবদ্ধ নয়। ধনী ও দরিদ্র—সব দেশের শ্রমজীবী মানুষের অভিন্ন উদ্বেগই এতে প্রতিফলিত হয়েছে। ২০০৮ সালের আর্থিক সংকট, কোভিড-১৯, ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ ও ক্রমবর্ধমান অভিবাসন চাপ—এসব মিলিয়ে মজুরি, চাকরির নিরাপত্তা ও মানুষের ক্রয়ক্ষমতা মারাত্মকভাবে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়েছে। ফলে ক্ষমতাসীন সরকারগুলো ক্রমেই বাস্তবতা থেকে বিচ্ছিন্ন মনে হচ্ছে। তবে জেন–জি আন্দোলনকারীরা রাজনৈতিক ব্যবস্থা ধ্বংস করতে চান না। তাঁরা চান এমন সরকার, যারা চাকরি দেবে, দুর্নীতি দমন করবে এবং জলবায়ু সংকট মোকাবিলায় বিনিয়োগ করবে। এসব দাবি বাস্তবসম্মত এবং এগুলো পূরণের পথও আছে। যুব বেকারত্ব তার একটি উদাহরণ। এক দশক আগে পর্তুগাল, আয়ারল্যান্ড, ইতালি, গ্রিস ও স্পেন—এই ‘পিআইআইজিএস’ দেশগুলো তীব্র ঋণসংকটে ভুগছিল। এখন তাদের চারটি দেশ যুব বেকারত্ব নাটকীয়ভাবে কমিয়েছে। পর্তুগালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সীদের বেকারত্ব ২০১৪ সালের ৩৪ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ থেকে ২০২৫ সালের অক্টোবরে নেমে এসেছে ১৮ দশমিক ৩ শতাংশে। আয়ারল্যান্ডে তা ২৪ দশমিক ২ থেকে কমে হয়েছে ১৩ দশমিক ৪ শতাংশ। গ্রিসে ৫২ দশমিক ৮ থেকে ২০২৪ সালে নেমেছে ২২ দশমিক ৪ শতাংশে। স্পেনে একই সময়ে হার কমেছে ৫৩ দশমিক ২ থেকে ২৬ দশমিক ৫ শতাংশে। এ অগ্রগতির পেছনে বড় ভূমিকা রেখেছে ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের ‘ইয়ুথ গ্যারান্টি’ কর্মসূচি। এ কর্মসূচির আওতায় সরকারগুলো প্রতিশ্রুতি দেয়—স্কুল শেষ করার বা বেকার হওয়ার চার মাসের মধ্যে তরুণদের চাকরি, প্রশিক্ষণ, শিক্ষানবিশ সুযোগ বা পড়াশোনার ব্যবস্থা করা হবে। সব সমস্যা মেটেনি, কিন্তু এটি দেখিয়েছে, রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছা থাকলে কী করা সম্ভব। দুর্নীতি দমন অবশ্য আরও কঠিন। আর্মেনিয়া, আজারবাইজান, মলদোভা ও ইউক্রেনের অভিজ্ঞতা তা প্রমাণ করে। তবু অগ্রগতি সম্ভব। এ জন্য দরকার দক্ষ ও ভালো বেতনভুক্ত সরকারি কর্মচারী, শক্তিশালী নজরদারি ও অডিট ব্যবস্থা এবং প্রকৃত রাজনৈতিক জবাবদিহি। ই-গভর্ন্যান্সও সহায়ক হতে পারে। রুয়ান্ডার ডিজিটাল সরকারি ক্রয়ব্যবস্থা দুর্নীতির সুযোগ কমিয়েছে। জর্জিয়ায় পুরোপুরি ইলেকট্রনিক টেন্ডার ব্যবস্থা চালুর ফলে প্রথম দিকে পরিমাপযোগ্য উন্নতি দেখা গেছে। স্বচ্ছতা এখানে অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। দুর্নীতি যখন সহনীয় হয়ে ওঠে, তখন তা ছড়িয়ে পড়ে। আর যখন তা প্রকাশ পায়, তখন সামাজিক চাপ ও সুনামের ঝুঁকি দুর্নীতিকে নিরুৎসাহিত করে। তাই হুইসেলব্লোয়ার সুরক্ষা, সহজলভ্য দুর্নীতিবিরোধী তথ্যভান্ডার ও ব্যবসায়িক খাতের দায়িত্বশীল ভূমিকা অপরিহার্য। নাইরি উডস অক্সফোর্ড বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ব্লাভাটনিক স্কুল অব গভর্নমেন্টের ডিন স্বত্ব: প্রজেক্ট সিন্ডিকেট, অনুবাদ: সারফুদ্দিন আহমেদ",

যদি কোটা আন্দোলনের মাধ্যমে তা না করা যেত, তবে সেটা হতো অন্য কোনো ইস্যুতে। কোটাবিরোধী আন্দোলনকে তাই কেন্দ্রবিন্দু না বলে, বরং হাসিনাবিরোধী আন্দোলনের প্রবেশপথ বললেই হয়তো বেশি যথার্থ হবে। দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে এমনই এক প্রবেশপথের জন্য ছাত্ররা অপেক্ষা করছিলেন ও প্রস্তুত হচ্ছিলেন। এসব কর্মী নিজেদের লক্ষ্য স্থির করেছিলেন ২০২৬ সালকে কেন্দ্র করে। কিন্তু পরিস্থিত এর আগেই তাঁদের এনে দেয় মোক্ষম সুযোগ, যেটা তাঁরা গ্রহণ করতেও ভুল করেননি।তবে তাঁরা (আন্দোলনকারীরা) পুরোটা সময় নিজেদের রাজনৈতিকভাবে স্বতন্ত্র হিসেবে পরিচিত করান। এর কারণ হলো, সরকার যেন তাঁদের আন্দোলনকে বিএনপি বা জামায়াতের আন্দোলন বলে নামাঙ্কিত করতে না পারে এবং সেই সুযোগে তাঁদের নির্বিচার দমন করতে না পারে। একই সঙ্গে তাঁদের পরিকল্পিত রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পও তাঁরা অনেকটা অপ্রকাশ্য রেখেই কোটার ইস্যুকে কাজে লাগিয়ে প্রাথমিক প্রতিরোধ গড়ে তোলেন। এই কৌশলগত সিদ্ধান্তকে আমি বলছি, ‘কৌশলী অরাজনৈতিকতা’। আন্দোলনের পর অনেক নেতাই তাঁদের রাজনৈতিক পরিচয় বা প্রকল্প প্রকাশ্য এনেছেন, আন্দোলনে কার কতটা অবদান, তা নিয়ে বাগ্‌বিতণ্ডায় লিপ্ত হয়েছেন। তবে আন্দোলনের সময় আন্দোলনের স্বার্থেই তাঁরা নীরবতা বজায় রেখেছিলেন। গুরত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হলো, বাইরে থেকে নিজেদের অরাজনৈতিক দেখানোর চেষ্টা করলেও, আদতে এই আন্দোলন ছিল পুরোপুরি রাজনৈতিক। তাঁদের একটি রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্প বরাবরই ছিল আর সেটাই অপরাপর বৃহৎ ছাত্র আন্দোলনের সঙ্গে এর পার্থক্য তৈরি করেছে। এই রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পের বর্তমান বাস্তবায়িত রূপ হলো জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টি (এনসিপি)। তবে কেবল ভোটের রাজনীতি নয়, বরং একটি পরিপূর্ণ ‘বিপ্লব’ ঘটানোর জন্যই এ আন্দোলনকারীরা ছিলেন চিরপ্রস্তুত। তাঁদের মধ্যে ছিল বৈপ্লবিক আকাঙ্ক্ষা, বৈপ্লবিক ঐকমত্য ও তাঁরা গড়ে তুলেছিলেন একটি বৈপ্লবিক জোট। একটি বৈপ্লবিক মুহূর্তও তাঁদের হাতে ধরা দিয়েছিল, যেটিকে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক পরিণতির দিকে নিয়ে যেতে পারতেন। নানা চাপের কারণে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক সমাধানের বদলে ‘মধ্যপন্থা’ বেছে নিয়েছেন এবং প্রমাণ করেছন যে মধ্যপন্থা মানে কেবল মাঝামাঝি অবস্থান করা নয়, অনেক সময় মিডিওক্রিটি বা মধ্যম মান বেছে নেওয়া। জুলাইয়ের আন্দোলনের একটা অন্যতম মূল চালিকা শক্তি ছিলেন এমন মানুষেরা, যাঁরা প্রকৃতপক্ষেই অরাজনৈতিক। এঁদের অনেকে কোনো প্রতিষ্ঠিত রাজনৈতিক দলকেই সমর্থন করেননি, তবে আওয়ামী লীগের শাসনে তাঁরা ত্যক্ত–বিরক্ত ছিলেন। অনেকে আওয়ামী লীগকে সমর্থন করলেও বিপুলসংখ্যক হতাহতের ঘটনা দেখে তাঁদের অবস্থানও বদলে গিয়েছিল। এই মানুষদের ভোট এনসিপি টানতে পারবে কি না, সেটা এখন একটা দেখার বিষয়। এই মুহূর্তে যাঁরা এনসিপিতে আছেন, তাঁদের অনেকে জুলাইয়ের ছাত্র নেতৃত্ব হলেও, আন্দোলনকারীদের একটা বড় অংশের অংশগ্রহণ এখানে অনুপস্থিত। আন্দোলনের শেষে একটা বড় অংশ ঘরে ফিরে গেছে। সেই ছাত্র–জনতা কোনো দলে যুক্ত হতে বা ক্ষমতার ভাগীদার হতেও আগ্রহী নন। এই মানুষগুলোকে আমি আমার ২০১৮ সালে প্রকাশিত এক গবেষণাপত্রে অভিহিত করেছিলাম বাংলাদেশি রাজনীতির ‘তৃতীয় শক্তি’ হিসেবে। এখন এই তৃতীয় শক্তির ভোট কারা সবচেয়ে সফলভাবে টানতে পারবে, সেটাই দেখার বিষয়। তবে দুঃখের বিষয় এই যে আমার ধারণা, নানা কারণে এনসিপি এই ভোটের একটা বড় অংশকেই এরই মধ্যে হারিয়ে ফেলেছে। জুলাইয়ের যে সাংগঠনিক কাঠামো, যে ‘যুক্তফ্রন্ট’ ছিল, সেটাকে ভেঙে এখন কেন্দ্রীভূত রাজনীতি করার চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। বিভিন্ন রাজনৈতিক মিত্র, যেমন বামপন্থীদের দূরে ঠেলে দেওয়া হয়েছে। কেন্দ্রীয় নিয়ন্ত্রণের রাজনীতি ধীরে ধীরে প্রকাশ হচ্ছে। এতে সাংগঠনিক শক্তি দুর্বল হচ্ছে। এনসিপির পদযাত্রায়, পথসভায় যতই ‘মানুষের ঢল’ দেখা যাক, সাংগঠনিক ক্ষমতাকে আরও শক্তিশালী করতে না পারলে এই দল দাঁড়াবে না। এনসিপির উচিত জুলাইয়ের স্মরণে হলেও তাঁদের আশপাশের অপরাপর গোষ্ঠী, দল, সংগঠনকে নিয়ে একটা বড় মৈত্রী গড়ে তোলা, যাতে সংগঠন শক্তিশালী হয়। জুলাই থেকে এই শিক্ষা নিতে না পারলে রাজনৈতিকভাবে এনসিপি হোঁচট খেতে পারে। জুলাইয়ের কান্ডারি হতে চাইলে এনসিপিকে জুলাই থেকেই শিক্ষা নিতে হবে। অনুপম দেবাশীষ রায় ইউনিভার্সিটি অব অক্সফোর্ডের ডিফিল (পিএইচডি) গবেষক।ই–মেইল: [email protected]",

        "body": "দেশে গত ১৩ বছরের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি হয়েছে জুলাই মাসে। শিক্ষার্থীদের কোটা সংস্কার আন্দোলনের মাসটিতে মূল্যস্ফীতি দুই অঙ্কের ঘর ছাড়িয়ে যায়। সরকার পরিবর্তনের সঙ্গে সঙ্গে বাংলাদেশ পরিসংখ্যান ব্যুরোর (বিবিএস) হিসাবে মূল্যস্ফীতিও যেন লাফ দিয়ে বেড়ে গেছে। এত দিন ধরে মূল্যস্ফীতির হিসাব নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলে আসছিলেন অর্থনীতিবিদেরা। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, গত জুলাই মাসে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে দাঁড়ায় ১১ দশমিক ৬৬ শতাংশ। গত জুন মাসে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ৯ দশমিক ৭২ শতাংশ। অন্যদিকে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি জুলাই মাসে বেড়ে ১৪ শতাংশ ছাড়াল। যা গত ১৩ বছরের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ। গতকাল সোমবার বিবিএস জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতির হালনাগাদ তথ্য প্রকাশ করেছে। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, এর আগে ২০১১ সালের সেপ্টেম্বরে সার্বিক মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল সর্বোচ্চ ১১ দশমিক ৯৭ শতাংশ। এরপর গত জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতি সর্বোচ্চ। কয়েক বছর ধরে বিবিএসের মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য নিয়ে শঙ্কা প্রকাশ করে আসছেন অর্থনীতিবিদেরা। তাঁরা বলছেন, সরকারি পরিসংখ্যানে মূল্যস্ফীতির যে হিসাব দেওয়া হচ্ছে, বাস্তবে সেটি আরও বেশি। সরকার মূল্যস্ফীতি কমিয়ে দেখাচ্ছে। অর্থনীতিবিদদের এ অবিশ্বাসের মধ্যেও এক বছর ধরে দেশে মূল্যস্ফীতি সাড়ে ৯ শতাংশের বেশি। বেসরকারি গবেষণা সংস্থা সাউথ এশিয়ান নেটওয়ার্ক অন ইকোনমিক মডেলিংয়ের (সানেম) নির্বাহী পরিচালক সেলিম রায়হান প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, এত দিন শঙ্কা ছিল মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য কমিয়ে দেখানো হচ্ছে। রাজনৈতিক সুবিধা নেওয়ার জন্য হয়তো এটা করা হয়েছিল। কারণ বাজারের জিনিসপত্রের দামের সঙ্গে মূল্যস্ফীতির তথ্য মিলছিল না। এখন রাজনৈতিক সরকার নেই। তাই মূল্যস্ফীতির প্রকৃত চিত্র বেরিয়ে আসতে শুরু করেছে। জুলাই মাসে পণ্য সরবরাহব্যবস্থা মারাত্মকভাবে বিঘ্নিত হয়। এর প্রতিফলনও দেখা গেছে মূল্যস্ফীতির হিসাবে। মূল্যস্ফীতি হলো একধরনের করের মতো, যা ধনী-গরিব নির্বিশেষ সবার ওপর চাপ বাড়ায়। গত জুলাই মাসে ১১ দশমিক ৬৬ শতাংশ মূল্যস্ফীতি হওয়ার মানে হলো, ২০২৩ সালের জুলাই মাসে একজন মানুষ যে পণ্য ১০০ টাকায় কিনেছেন, চলতি বছরের জুলাই মাসে একই পণ্য ও সেবা কিনতে তাঁর খরচ হয়েছে ১১১ টাকা ৬৬ পয়সা। অর্থাৎ এক বছরের ব্যবধানে প্রতি ১০০ টাকায় খরচ বেড়েছে ১১ টাকা ৬৬ পয়সা। এ বিষয়ে জানতে চাইলে বিবিএসের একজন ঊর্ধ্বতন কর্মকর্তা নাম প্রকাশ না করার শর্তে প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, সারা দেশের ১৫৪টি বাজার থেকে তথ্য–উপাত্ত অনলাইনে সংগ্রহ করে জুলাই মাসের মূল্যস্ফীতি গণনা করা হয়েছে। গত মাসে পণ্য সরবরাহব্যবস্থা বিঘ্নিত হওয়ায় হঠাৎ মূল্যস্ফীতির হার বেড়ে থাকতে পারে। ১৩ বছরে সর্বোচ্চ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বিবিএসের তথ্য অনুযায়ী, গত জুলাই মাসে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে দাঁড়িয়েছে ১৪ দশমিক ১০ শতাংশে। জুনে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ১০ দশমিক ৪২ শতাংশ। এক মাসের ব্যবধানে হঠাৎ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেশ খানিকটা বেড়ে গেছে। জুলাইয়ে যে খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি দাঁড়িয়েছে, তা গত ১৩ বছর ৪ মাস বা ১৬০ মাসের মধ্যে সর্বোচ্চ। এর আগে সর্বশেষ সর্বোচ্চ খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ছিল ২০১১ সালের এপ্রিলে, ১৪ দশমিক ৩৬ শতাংশ। এরপর আর কখনো খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি ১৪ শতাংশে ওঠেনি। খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি বেড়ে যাওয়া প্রসঙ্গে সানেমের নির্বাহী পরিচালক সেলিম রায়হান বলেন, এত খাদ্য মূল্যস্ফীতি অসম্ভব উদ্বেগের বিষয়। এ অবস্থায় গরিব মানুষকে সুরক্ষা দিতে পদক্ষেপ নেওয়া জরুরি হয়ে পড়েছে। গত কয়েক সপ্তাহের রাজনৈতিক অস্থিরতা ও নিরাপত্তাহীনতায় গরিব ও সীমিত আয়ের মানুষের কর্মসংস্থান আরও সংকুচিত হয়েছে। তাঁদের আয় কমেছে। তাতে আরও বেশি চাপে পড়েছেন খেটে খাওয়া মানুষেরা। বিবিএসের হিসাবে, খাদ্যবহির্ভূত মূল্যস্ফীতিও বেড়েছে। গত জুলাইয়ে খাদ্যবহির্ভূত মূল্যস্ফীতির হার বেড়ে দাঁড়ায় ৯ দশমিক ৬৮ শতাংশে। জুনে এই হার ছিল ৯ দশমিক ১৫ শতাংশ। অর্থনীতিবিদেরা বলছেন, উচ্চ মূল্যস্ফীতি নিয়ন্ত্রণই এখন অর্থনীতির বড় চ্যালেঞ্জ। এক বছর ধরে মূল্যস্ফীতি ৯ শতাংশের ওপরে আছে। আয় বৃদ্ধির তুলনায় মূল্যস্ফীতি বেশি বেড়ে গেলে গরিব ও মধ্যবিত্তের সংসার চালাতে ভোগান্তি বাড়ে। এমনিতে বাজারের জিনিসপত্রের দাম বেশ চড়া। তার সঙ্গে চিকিৎসা, পরিবহনসহ খাদ্যবহির্ভূত খাতেও খরচ বেড়ে গেছে। সব মিলিয়ে মূল্যস্ফীতির চাপ সামাল দিতে হিমশিম খাচ্ছেন মানুষ।",

In a statement, he said that because of the evil efforts of that quarter, there is also a risk that the conspiracies of anti-Bangladesh fascist forces may succeed, reports BSS. Abrar said when the entire nation is mourning the heart-breaking martyrdom of Sharif Osman Hadi, taking advantage of this incident, a small number of extremist and reckless groups are engaged to create disorder and chaos in different parts of the country. These groups attacked the building of one of Bangladesh’s long-standing cultural institutions, ‘Chhayanaut’, set it on fire, and destroyed many of its musical and educational materials, he said. The educational activities of ‘Nalanda’, which is run in that building under the management of Chhayanaut, have also been affected by this attack, he mentioned. The education adviser strongly condemned this incident. He also condemned the attack and arson at the office of the cultural organization ‘Udichi’. Abrar expressed deep concern and strong condemnation over the attacks carried out on the offices of two newspapers, ‘Prothom Alo’ and ‘The Daily Star’, and over the despicable act of humiliating the country’s veteran, undaunted journalist and daily New Age editor Nurul Kabir.",

        "title": "The technology that could 'revolutionise' how people light the world",
        "body": "Kick-started by the invention of the light bulb, the way we illuminate our homes and our lives is ever-changing - particularly in a world where the challenge is to light more, but to consume less energy. But Mark Major, one of the world's leading lighting designers, believes we're at the early stages of a lighting revolution. \"Changing technology makes me feel very clearly that this is as much of a revolution going on now as perhaps when gas went out and electric lighting came in,\" he says. But what is it that makes something beautifully lit, and what role does technological innovation play in illuminating both our buildings and our state of well-being? Major's work - along with his late partner Jonathan Speirs - is award-winning, credited with enhancing the atmosphere of already iconic structures. It is arguably Speirs + Major's most distinctive work, unmissable to Londoners, that displays this like none other: St. Paul's Cathedral. \"It was a great privilege to work on that project,\" he says. \"Probably one of the toughest assignments we've ever had. It took about five years in its execution to design and have the lighting fully delivered.\" The result is a building swathed in soft light - giving the building a sense of serenity in the hustle and bustle of Britain's capital city. Inside, it was an even bigger task. \"When you're dealing with not just a heritage building, but a heritage building of that nature, you realise it was never really designed to be seen under artificial light in quite that way - it would have been seen in candlelight. \"You're placing, in a way, a new interpretation on the building and its architecture after dark, and you have to be very careful how you do that.\" As well as tremendous buildings - Speirs + Major also work with more practical locations such as offices or restaurants, and even our streets. \"On a very basic level,\" Major says, \"Well-designed lighting in the streets of cities doesn't just keep you safe and secure, but also can really help to create a pleasant and interesting atmosphere. \"It can bring out the colour and texture of the landscape, it can sort of direct you to places, it can play a number of different roles in the city that are more than simply enabling us to see - good lighting makes our cities more legible. \"And I hope, as a result, more enjoyable.\" He envisions a future where streets light up as you walk down them, but get dimmer when no-one's around, saving energy. Not only this, but the light can be used to change the very mood of the street depending on the occasion - a delicate skill. \"We all know the difference between a romantic candlelit supper for two, with that soft, warm, glowing light focal that makes your partner look wonderful, and sitting in a fast food restaurant under fluorescent lighting and what a grim experience that can be.\" This type of flexibility would not be possible with traditional filament bulbs. Advancements in light emitting diode (LED) technology means lighting specialists are able to come up with far more complex arrangements. \"We've moved a long way from candles and gaslights,\" Major says. \"LEDs are going to fundamentally revolutionise the way we work with light. \"It's smaller, it's cooler, and the quality of LED lighting has improved so much. Warmer light, broader spectrum, better skin tones, better reproduction of colour - just the overall quality.\" But there are downsides with this revolution, he argues. \"The more light we bring into the world, the greater some of the challenges become. \"Research is beginning to rapidly prove that you can have too much of a good thing - we all know about light pollution.\" And it's not just human beings who would be affected, Major says. \"Many creatures are adapted to the night - so by bringing along a lot of light we can really impact on their feeding habits, on their breeding patterns and all sorts of things. \"So we can enrich our lives, but we have to be quite careful how we work with this industrial material.\"",

        "body": "জুলাই অভ্যুত্থানের এক বছর পূর্তি উপলক্ষে হাল আমলে নতুন করে পুরোনো এক তত্ত্ব বাজারে হাজির হয়েছে। এটা হলো ‘মেটিকুলাস ডিজাইন তত্ত্ব’। সম্প্রতি এক ফেসবুক পোস্টে চব্বিশের গণ–অভ্যুত্থানের অন্যতম সংগঠক ও বর্তমান তথ্য উপদেষ্টা মাহফুজ আলম দাবি করেছেন, আংশিক হলেও একটা অভ্যুত্থান নিগূঢ় পরিকল্পনা অনুসারে ঘটেছে। মাহফুজ আলমের এই মন্তব্যের সঙ্গে আমি পুরোপুরি একমত হতে পারিনি। তবে ছাত্রেরা যে দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে পরিকল্পনা করেই আন্দোলনের জন্য প্রস্তুত হয়েছেন, সেটা আমি এই লেখার অবয়বে তুলে ধরব। সামাজিক বিজ্ঞানে ‘কেন্দ্রীয় পরিকল্পনা’ নিয়ে একধরনের তত্ত্ব চালু আছে। এই তত্ত্ব অনুসারে, সামাজিক বা অর্থনৈতিক বিষয়াদি আগে থেকে পরিকল্পনা করে আসলে পুরোপুরি বাস্তবায়ন করা যায় না। এ বিষয়ে ফ্রেডেরিক হায়েককে স্মরণ করতে হয়। তিনি বলেছিলেন অর্থশাস্ত্রের কৌতূহল জাগানো কাজ হলো মানুষকে দেখানো যে যেটাকে তাঁরা পরিকল্পনা করবেন বলে মনে করেন, সেটা তাঁদের কতটা অজানা। হায়েকের ‘রাত পাহারার সরকারের ধারণা’র সঙ্গে তীব্র দ্বিমত থাকলেও আমি তাঁর পরিকল্পনার সীমাবদ্ধতা তত্ত্বের সঙ্গে আংশিকভাবে একমত। কোনো আন্দোলন বা অভ্যুত্থানের পূর্বপরিকল্পনা থাকতেই পারে, কিন্তু তা বাস্তবায়নের বিভিন্ন পর্যায়ে বাস্তবতা এতই বিচিত্র থাকে যে সেই পরিকল্পনা নানা সময় ভেস্তেও যেতে পারে। একটা আন্দোলনে কোন মুহূর্তে কোন সিদ্ধান্ত নিতে হবে, তা আগেভাগে নির্ধারিত বা ঠিক করা থাকে না। আন্দোলনে সরকার ও আন্দোলনকারী পক্ষ একটা ‘গেম থিওরি’ সদৃশ অবস্থানে উপনীত হয়, যেখানে একজনের সিদ্ধান্তের ওপর অপরের সিদ্ধান্ত অনকটাই নির্ভর করে। ছাত্র নেতৃত্বের কৃতিত্ব এখানেই যে তাঁরা গেম থিওরির বিশেষজ্ঞের মতো সরকারকে বুদ্ধির খেলায় ‘কুপোকাত’ করতে পেরেছেন। সেসব কুপোকাতের মধ্যে বিশেষভাবে উল্লেখযোগ্য একটি ঘটনার উদাহরণ দেওয়া যেতে পারে। ডিবি হারুন (ঢাকা মহানগর গোয়েন্দা পুলিশের সাবেক অতিরিক্ত কমিশনার মোহাম্মদ হারুন অর রশীদ) আন্দোলনের সামনের সারির নেতাদের তুলে নিয়ে তাঁদের দিয়ে আন্দোলন প্রত্যাহারের ঘোষণা দিতে বাধ্য করেছিলেন। এটা ছিল একটি ‘নাটক’। এর প্রত্যুত্তরে বাইরে থাকা ছাত্র নেতৃত্ব আন্দোলন চালিয়ে যাওয়ার ঘোষণা দেন। এই ঘোষণা আন্দোলন অব্যাহত রাখতে এবং আন্দোলনের গতিপথ নির্ধারণে নিয়ামক ভূমিকা পালন করেছে। একই রকম ‘নাটক’ নিরাপদ সড়ক আন্দোলনের সময়ও করা হয়েছিল। তখনও একদল ছাত্রকে আন্দোলনের নেতা বানিয়ে আন্দোলন প্রত্যাহারের ঘোষণা দেওয়ানো হয়েছিল। কিন্তু জুলাইয়ে তফাত ছিল এই যে এবার আন্দোলনকারীদের হাতে ছিল মোক্ষম এক অস্ত্র—সংগঠন। সংগঠন থাকার কারণেই এক সারির নেতাদের দিয়ে জোর করে আন্দোলন বন্ধ করার ঘোষণা দেওয়ালেও, পরের সারির নেতারা আন্দোলন চালিয়ে যাওয়ার আহ্বান জানাতে পেরেছিলেন। জুলাই গণ–অভ্যুত্থানের ‘মেটিকুলাস ডিজাইন’ যদি কিছু থেকে থাকে, তা হলো এই সাংগঠনিক কাঠামো। এই সংগঠন এক দিনে গড়ে ওঠেনি। এর পেছনে রয়েছে দীর্ঘদিনের রাজনৈতিক চর্চা।এই চর্চার মূল সূতিকাগার ছিল ২০১৮ সালের কোটা ও নিরাপদ সড়ক আন্দোলন। বিশেষত, নিরাপদ সড়ক আন্দোলনের সময়ে ছাত্ররা বুঝতে পারেন যে একটি রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্প ও রাজনৈতিক চর্চা ছাড়া দীর্ঘ মেয়াদে কিছু পরিবর্তন করা সম্ভব নয়। সেই সময় থেকেই ধীরে ধীরে ছাত্র–ছাত্রীদের মধ্যে নানা আলাপ–আলোচনা ও স্বশিক্ষার সংগঠন গড়ে ওঠে, যেগুলো ছিল গভীরভাবে রাজনৈতিক। এর মধ্যে জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ‘স্বচিন্তন’ এবং ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ‘গুরুবার আড্ডার’ কথা উল্লেখ করা যায়। এ ছাড়া নানা আলোচনা সভা, বিভিন্ন সময়ে প্রতিবাদ-প্রতিরোধের মাধ্যমে আন্দোলনকারী ছাত্র–ছাত্রীদের মধ্যে এক রকম মৈত্রী গড়ে ওঠে। সেখান থেকে আর কোটা আন্দোলনের গর্ভে জন্ম নেওয়া গণ অধিকার পরিষদের নানা সীমাবদ্ধতার কারণেই নতুন ছাত্রসংগঠন হিসেবে গণতান্ত্রিক ছাত্র শক্তি গড়ে ওঠে। জুলাই অভ্যুত্থানের অনেক অগ্রসৈনিকই এই সংগঠন (গণতান্ত্রিক ছাত্র শক্তি) থেকেই গড়ে ওঠেন। আন্দোলনের স্বার্থে তাঁরা আবার গড়ে তোলেন আরেকটি প্ল্যাটফর্ম, যার নাম দেওয়া হয় বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলন। এই পদক্ষেপও আন্দোলনের একাডেমিক ধারণার সঙ্গে খাপ খেয়ে যায়। ম্যানসার ওলসনের তত্ত্ব একটু বিশ্লেষণ করলেই দেখা যায় যে তিনি ছোট ছোট সংগঠনের একত্র হয়ে ‘যুক্তফ্রন্ট’ গড়ে তোলাকেই শ্রেষ্ঠতম কৌশল হিসেবে ব্যাখ্যা করেছেন। বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলনে যেমন গণতান্ত্রিক ছাত্র শক্তি শক্ত অবস্থানে ছিল, তেমনি ছিলেন প্রকাশ্যে-অপ্রকাশ্যে ডান-বাম ছাত্ররাজনীতি করা অনেক ছেলে–মেয়ে। তবে একটা গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ব্যাপার হলো যে এই সংগঠন নিজেদের রাজনৈতিকভাবে স্বতন্ত্র হিসেবে পরিচয় দিয়েছে। এই চিহ্নায়ণের বিশেষত্ব হলো যে তাঁরা নিজেদের ‘অরাজনৈতিক’ হিসেবে প্রকাশ করেননি। এই বর্গের নিজস্ব একটা রাজনীতি সব সময়ই ছিল। এ রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পের কেন্দ্রে ছিল সবাই মিলে এক জোট হয়ে হাসিনা সরকারের উচ্ছেদ করা; যদি কোটা আন্দোলনের মাধ্যমে তা না করা যেত, তবে সেটা হতো অন্য কোনো ইস্যুতে। কোটাবিরোধী আন্দোলনকে তাই কেন্দ্রবিন্দু না বলে, বরং হাসিনাবিরোধী আন্দোলনের প্রবেশপথ বললেই হয়তো বেশি যথার্থ হবে। দীর্ঘ সময় ধরে এমনই এক প্রবেশপথের জন্য ছাত্ররা অপেক্ষা করছিলেন ও প্রস্তুত হচ্ছিলেন। এসব কর্মী নিজেদের লক্ষ্য স্থির করেছিলেন ২০২৬ সালকে কেন্দ্র করে। কিন্তু পরিস্থিত এর আগেই তাঁদের এনে দেয় মোক্ষম সুযোগ, যেটা তাঁরা গ্রহণ করতেও ভুল করেননি।তবে তাঁরা (আন্দোলনকারীরা) পুরোটা সময় নিজেদের রাজনৈতিকভাবে স্বতন্ত্র হিসেবে পরিচিত করান। এর কারণ হলো, সরকার যেন তাঁদের আন্দোলনকে বিএনপি বা জামায়াতের আন্দোলন বলে নামাঙ্কিত করতে না পারে এবং সেই সুযোগে তাঁদের নির্বিচার দমন করতে না পারে। একই সঙ্গে তাঁদের পরিকল্পিত রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পও তাঁরা অনেকটা অপ্রকাশ্য রেখেই কোটার ইস্যুকে কাজে লাগিয়ে প্রাথমিক প্রতিরোধ গড়ে তোলেন। এই কৌশলগত সিদ্ধান্তকে আমি বলছি, ‘কৌশলী অরাজনৈতিকতা’। আন্দোলনের পর অনেক নেতাই তাঁদের রাজনৈতিক পরিচয় বা প্রকল্প প্রকাশ্য এনেছেন, আন্দোলনে কার কতটা অবদান, তা নিয়ে বাগ্‌বিতণ্ডায় লিপ্ত হয়েছেন। তবে আন্দোলনের সময় আন্দোলনের স্বার্থেই তাঁরা নীরবতা বজায় রেখেছিলেন। গুরত্বপূর্ণ বিষয় হলো, বাইরে থেকে নিজেদের অরাজনৈতিক দেখানোর চেষ্টা করলেও, আদতে এই আন্দোলন ছিল পুরোপুরি রাজনৈতিক। তাঁদের একটি রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্প বরাবরই ছিল আর সেটাই অপরাপর বৃহৎ ছাত্র আন্দোলনের সঙ্গে এর পার্থক্য তৈরি করেছে। এই রাজনৈতিক প্রকল্পের বর্তমান বাস্তবায়িত রূপ হলো জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টি (এনসিপি)। তবে কেবল ভোটের রাজনীতি নয়, বরং একটি পরিপূর্ণ ‘বিপ্লব’ ঘটানোর জন্যই এ আন্দোলনকারীরা ছিলেন চিরপ্রস্তুত। তাঁদের মধ্যে ছিল বৈপ্লবিক আকাঙ্ক্ষা, বৈপ্লবিক ঐকমত্য ও তাঁরা গড়ে তুলেছিলেন একটি বৈপ্লবিক জোট। একটি বৈপ্লবিক মুহূর্তও তাঁদের হাতে ধরা দিয়েছিল, যেটিকে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক পরিণতির দিকে নিয়ে যেতে পারতেন। নানা চাপের কারণে তাঁরা বৈপ্লবিক সমাধানের বদলে ‘মধ্যপন্থা’ বেছে নিয়েছেন এবং প্রমাণ করেছন যে মধ্যপন্থা মানে কেবল মাঝামাঝি অবস্থান করা নয়, অনেক সময় মিডিওক্রিটি বা মধ্যম মান বেছে নেওয়া। জুলাইয়ের আন্দোলনের একটা অন্যতম মূল চালিকা শক্তি ছিলেন এমন মানুষেরা, যাঁরা প্রকৃতপক্ষেই অরাজনৈতিক। এঁদের অনেকে কোনো প্রতিষ্ঠিত রাজনৈতিক দলকেই সমর্থন করেননি, তবে আওয়ামী লীগের শাসনে তাঁরা ত্যক্ত–বিরক্ত ছিলেন। অনেকে আওয়ামী লীগকে সমর্থন করলেও বিপুলসংখ্যক হতাহতের ঘটনা দেখে তাঁদের অবস্থানও বদলে গিয়েছিল। এই মানুষদের ভোট এনসিপি টানতে পারবে কি না, সেটা এখন একটা দেখার বিষয়। এই মুহূর্তে যাঁরা এনসিপিতে আছেন, তাঁদের অনেকে জুলাইয়ের ছাত্র নেতৃত্ব হলেও, আন্দোলনকারীদের একটা বড় অংশের অংশগ্রহণ এখানে অনুপস্থিত। আন্দোলনের শেষে একটা বড় অংশ ঘরে ফিরে গেছে। সেই ছাত্র–জনতা কোনো দলে যুক্ত হতে বা ক্ষমতার ভাগীদার হতেও আগ্রহী নন। এই মানুষগুলোকে আমি আমার ২০১৮ সালে প্রকাশিত এক গবেষণাপত্রে অভিহিত করেছিলাম বাংলাদেশি রাজনীতির ‘তৃতীয় শক্তি’ হিসেবে। এখন এই তৃতীয় শক্তির ভোট কারা সবচেয়ে সফলভাবে টানতে পারবে, সেটাই দেখার বিষয়। তবে দুঃখের বিষয় এই যে আমার ধারণা, নানা কারণে এনসিপি এই ভোটের একটা বড় অংশকেই এরই মধ্যে হারিয়ে ফেলেছে। জুলাইয়ের যে সাংগঠনিক কাঠামো, যে ‘যুক্তফ্রন্ট’ ছিল, সেটাকে ভেঙে এখন কেন্দ্রীভূত রাজনীতি করার চেষ্টা করা হচ্ছে। বিভিন্ন রাজনৈতিক মিত্র, যেমন বামপন্থীদের দূরে ঠেলে দেওয়া হয়েছে। কেন্দ্রীয় নিয়ন্ত্রণের রাজনীতি ধীরে ধীরে প্রকাশ হচ্ছে। এতে সাংগঠনিক শক্তি দুর্বল হচ্ছে। এনসিপির পদযাত্রায়, পথসভায় যতই ‘মানুষের ঢল’ দেখা যাক, সাংগঠনিক ক্ষমতাকে আরও শক্তিশালী করতে না পারলে এই দল দাঁড়াবে না। এনসিপির উচিত জুলাইয়ের স্মরণে হলেও তাঁদের আশপাশের অপরাপর গোষ্ঠী, দল, সংগঠনকে নিয়ে একটা বড় মৈত্রী গড়ে তোলা, যাতে সংগঠন শক্তিশালী হয়। জুলাই থেকে এই শিক্ষা নিতে না পারলে রাজনৈতিকভাবে এনসিপি হোঁচট খেতে পারে। জুলাইয়ের কান্ডারি হতে চাইলে এনসিপিকে জুলাই থেকেই শিক্ষা নিতে হবে। অনুপম দেবাশীষ রায় ইউনিভার্সিটি অব অক্সফোর্ডের ডিফিল (পিএইচডি) গবেষক।ই–মেইল: [email protected]",

        "body": "আট বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে খোঁজ নিয়ে জানা গেছে, ৭টিতে পোষ্য কোটা রয়েছে। সব বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ১১ ধরনের কোটার সব কটি নেই। জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ভর্তিতে শিক্ষক, কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীদের সন্তান, স্ত্রী ও ভাই-বোনদের জন্য কোটা রয়েছে। পরীক্ষায় পাস করলেই পোষ্যরা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়টিতে ভর্তির সুযোগ পান। জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় প্রশাসন জানিয়েছে, ভর্তি পরীক্ষায় উত্তীর্ণ হয়ে যতজন আবেদন করেন, ততজনকেই ভর্তি করা হয়। এবার অবশ্য পোষ্য কোটায় প্রতি বিভাগে চারজনের বেশি ভর্তির সুযোগ দেওয়া হবে না বলে জানানো হয়েছে। ফলে ৩৭টি বিভাগ ও ইনস্টিটিউটে সর্বোচ্চ ১৪৮ জন পোষ্য কোটায় ভর্তির সুযোগ পাবেন। বিগত পাঁচ বছরে পোষ্য কোটায় বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়টিতে সর্বনিম্ন ৫৩, সর্বোচ্চ ৫৯ জন ভর্তি হয়েছেন। দেশের বিভিন্ন পাবলিক বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে স্নাতক (সম্মান) প্রথম বর্ষে ভর্তিতে কোটা নিয়ে এখন আলোচনা চলছে। কোথাও কোথাও আন্দোলন হচ্ছে। বিশেষ করে পোষ্য কোটা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলছেন আন্দোলনকারীরা। ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, রাজশাহী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, সিলেটের শাহজালাল বিজ্ঞান ও প্রযুক্তি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, ময়মনসিংহে অবস্থিত বাংলাদেশ কৃষি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়, কুষ্টিয়ায় অবস্থিত ইসলামী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় এবং কুমিল্লা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়—এই আট বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে খোঁজ নিয়ে ১১ ধরনের কোটার অস্তিত্ব পাওয়া গেছে। এর মধ্যে বাংলাদেশ কৃষি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় ছাড়া বাকি সাত বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পোষ্য কোটা রয়েছে। সাতটির মধ্যে রাজশাহী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে সম্প্রতি পোষ্য কোটা আন্দোলনের মুখে বাতিল ঘোষণা করা হয়। এখন পোষ্য কোটা ফেরাতে আন্দোলন করছেন কর্মকর্তা–কর্মচারীরা। পোষ্য কোটার বাইরে বাকি ১০ ধরনের কোটা হলো প্রতিবন্ধী, বীর মুক্তিযোদ্ধা, খেলোয়াড়, ক্ষুদ্র নৃগোষ্ঠী, অনগ্রসর ক্ষুদ্র নৃগোষ্ঠী, অ–উপজাতি (পার্বত্য এলাকায় বসবাসকারী বাঙালী), বিদেশি শিক্ষার্থী, দলিত, চা–শ্রমিক ও বিকেএসপি (বাংলাদেশ ক্রীড়া শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠান) কোটা। অবশ্য সব বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে এই ১১ ধরনের কোটার সব কটি নেই। এর বাইরে জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে উপাচার্য কোটা ছিল, যার আওতায় উপাচার্য ২০ জন শিক্ষার্থী ভর্তি করাতে পারতেন। কয়েক মাস ধরে জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পোষ্য কোটার যৌক্তিক সংস্কার, উপাচার্য কোটা ও বীর মুক্তিযোদ্ধার নাতি-নাতনি কোটা বাতিলসহ বিভিন্ন দাবিতে আন্দোলন হচ্ছে। এর পরিপ্রেক্ষিতে গত ২৬ ডিসেম্বর প্রশাসন বীর মুক্তিযোদ্ধার নাতি-নাতনি কোটা ও উপাচার্য কোটা বাতিল ঘোষণা করে। পাশাপাশি পোষ্য কোটা নির্দিষ্ট করা হয়। জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের আন্দোলনকারী শিক্ষার্থী আবদুর রশিদ বলেন, কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীদের সন্তানদের জন্য গ্রহণযোগ্য মাত্রায় পোষ্য কোটা থাকতে পারে, তবে সেখানে সংস্কার করতে হবে। একটি বিভাগে একজনের বেশি পোষ্য কোটায় ভর্তি করা যাবে না। বর্তমান নিয়ম অনুযায়ী, কোনোমতে পাস করলেই ভর্তির সুযোগ দেওয়া যাবে না। ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের প্রশাসন জানায়, পোষ্যরা ভর্তি পরীক্ষায় উত্তীর্ণ হলে এবং কোনো নির্দিষ্ট বিভাগে ভর্তির শর্ত পূরণ করলে, তাঁকে সেখানে ভর্তির সুযোগ দেওয়া হয়। এ জন্য মেধাতালিকার কাউকে বঞ্চিত করা হয় না; বরং প্রয়োজনে সংশ্লিষ্ট বিভাগে একটি–দুটি আসন বাড়ে। চার বছরে ভর্তির চিত্রে দেখা যায়, ঢাকা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে বছরে ২৪ থেকে ৩০ জন ভর্তি হয়েছেন পোষ্য কোটায়। আবেদন করেছিলেন অনেক বেশি। রাজশাহী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ৪ শতাংশ পোষ্য কোটা ছিল। আন্দোলনের পর গত ১৪ নভেম্বর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় প্রশাসন এবারের ভর্তি পরীক্ষায় পোষ্য কোটা ৩ শতাংশ করার কথা জানায়। তবে আন্দোলন থামেনি। একপর্যায়ে ১ জানুয়ারি শিক্ষক ও কর্মকর্তার সন্তানদের জন্য পোষ্য কোটা পুরোপুরি বাতিল করে শুধু কর্মচারীদের সন্তানদের জন্য ১ শতাংশ কোটা রাখার সিদ্ধান্ত জানায় প্রশাসন। তা–ও মানেননি আন্দোলনকারীরা। পরে উপাচার্য সালেহ্ হাসান নকীব পোষ্য কোটা পুরো বাতিলের ঘোষণা দেন, যার বিরুদ্ধে আন্দোলন শুরু করেছেন কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারীরা। রাজশাহী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের অফিসার সমিতির ভারপ্রাপ্ত সভাপতি মুক্তার হোসেন বলেন, দাবি না মানা হলে আরও কঠোর আন্দোলনে যাবেন তাঁরা। চট্টগ্রাম বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পোষ্যদের জন্য ১৬৬টি আসন রয়েছে। তবে সেখানে ভর্তি হয় সাধারণ মেধাতালিকার বাইরে থেকে। ইসলামী বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পোষ্য কোটার নির্দিষ্ট আসন সংখ্যা নেই। পাস করলেই পোষ্য কোটায় ভর্তি হতে পারেন আবেদনকারীরা। শাহজালাল বিজ্ঞান ও প্রযুক্তি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পোষ্য কোটায় ২০টি আসন রয়েছে। কুমিল্লা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ৬ ধরনের কোটা রয়েছে। এর মধ্যে সবচেয়ে বেশি ৩৮টি আসন রাখা হয়েছে পোষ্য কোটায়, যা ওয়ার্ড কোটা নামে পরিচিত। বৈষম্যবিরোধী ছাত্র আন্দোলনের কর্মী মো. হান্নান রাহিম প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, ‘কুমিল্লা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় এই মুহূর্তে আমরা পোষ্য কোটা বাতিল চেয়ে আন্দোলন করছি। তবে অনগ্রসর মানুষের জন্য কিছু কোটা থাকা দরকার, তাই অন্যান্য কোটা সংস্কার করতে হবে।’ বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোর শিক্ষক, কর্মকর্তা ও কর্মচারীরা পোষ্য কোটা কিছুটা হলেও রাখার দাবি করছেন। প্রয়োজনে তা সংস্কারের পক্ষ তাঁরা। কুমিল্লা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় শিক্ষক সমিতির সদ্য সাবেক সভাপতি অধ্যাপক মো. আবু তাহের প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, ‘কর্মকর্তা-কর্মচারীদের সন্তানদের বাড়তি টাকা দিয়ে প্রাইভেট বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে পড়ানোর সক্ষমতা নেই। তাই আমরা পোষ্য কোটা পুরোপুরি বাতিল না করে সংখ্যাটা কমিয়ে সংস্কারের দাবি জানাচ্ছি।’ অনগ্রসর জনগোষ্ঠীর জন্য প্রায় সব বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়েই কোটা রয়েছে। সেগুলো থাকা দরকার এবং সব ক্ষেত্রেই স্বচ্ছতা নিশ্চিত করা দরকার বলে মনে করেন সংশ্লিষ্ট ব্যক্তিরা। গণতান্ত্রিক অধিকার কমিটির সদস্য ও জাহাঙ্গীরনগর বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের অবসরপ্রাপ্ত অধ্যাপক আনু মুহাম্মদ প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, অনগ্রসর জনগোষ্ঠীর জন্য কোটা থাকতেই হবে। পোষ্য কোটার ক্ষেত্রে আসন ও সম্পর্কের ধরন সীমিত করা যেতে পারে। আবার ভর্তির ক্ষেত্রে যোগ্যতার শর্তও পর্যালোচনা করা যায়। একেবারে বাদ দেওয়া কঠিন হবে। মুক্তিযোদ্ধা কোটার বিষয়ে আনু মুহাম্মদ বলেন, বীর মুক্তিযোদ্ধাদের সন্তান হিসেবে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ভর্তির আবেদনকারী এখন আর খুব একটা থাকে বলে মনে হয় না। নাতিপুতিদের ক্ষেত্রে কোটা নির্দিষ্ট সময় দিয়ে রহিত করা যেতে পারে।",

জনসংযোগ করে আসছেন দলের প্রার্থীরা। নির্বাচন সামনে রেখে কোনো প্রচার-প্রচারণায় নেই জাতীয় পার্টি। জাতীয় নাগরিক পার্টি (এনসিপি) প্রার্থী ঘোষণা না করলেও প্রতিটি আসনে সম্ভাব্য প্রার্থীরা তৎপর রয়েছেন। কিছু আসনে প্রার্থী দিয়েছে গণসংহতি আন্দোলন। এ ছাড়া ইসলামী আন্দোলন, বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্টসহ কয়েকটি ইসলামপন্থী দলের প্রার্থীরাও মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম নগরসহ জেলায় সংসদীয় আসন রয়েছে ১৬টি। এর মধ্যে চট্টগ্রাম উত্তরের সাতটি উপজেলায় আসন রয়েছে সাতটি। ১৯৯১ থেকে ২০০৮ সাল পর্যন্ত পাঁচটি সংসদ নির্বাচনে চট্টগ্রামের উত্তরের সাতটি আসনে বিএনপি জয় পেয়েছে বেশি—২০ বার। অন্যদিকে ওইসব নির্বাচনে আওয়ামী লীগ (বর্তমানের কার্যক্রম নিষিদ্ধ) জয় পায় (একবার উপনির্বাচনসহ) ১১ বার। জাতীয় পার্টি, বাংলাদেশের কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি, বিলুপ্ত ন্যাশনাল ডেমোক্রেটিক পার্টি (এনডিপি) একবার করে জয় পায়। এ ছাড়া দুবার জয় পান স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থীরা। তবে প্রার্থী থাকলেও জামায়াতে ইসলামী এসব আসনে কখনো জয় পায়নি। ২০১৪, ২০১৮ ও ২০২৪ সালের নির্বাচনে একক নিয়ন্ত্রণ ছিল আওয়ামী লীগের। চট্টগ্রাম-১ (মিরসরাই) বিএনপি এই আসনে প্রার্থী করেছে দলের চট্টগ্রাম উত্তর জেলা শাখার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক ও সাবেক উপজেলা চেয়ারম্যান নুরুল আমিনকে। ২০১৮ সালের নির্বাচনেও দলীয় প্রার্থী ছিলেন তিনি। আসনটিতে বিএনপির মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশীদের মধ্যে আরও ছিলেন জেলা শাখার আরেক সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক নুরুল আমিন, উপজেলা বিএনপির সাবেক আহ্বায়ক শাহীদুল ইসলাম চৌধুরী ও ব্যবসায়ী নেতা মহিউদ্দিন আহমেদ চৌধুরী। প্রার্থী পরিবর্তন চেয়ে দলের ভারপ্রাপ্ত চেয়ারম্যান তারেক রহমানের কাছে ১১ জন নেতা চিঠি দিয়েছেন। জানতে চাইলে বিএনপির প্রার্থী চট্টগ্রাম উত্তর জেলার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক নুরুল আমিন প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, ‘আমি সবাইকে নিয়ে কাজ করতে চাই। কেউ না এলে সেটি তাঁদের বিষয়।’ উপজেলা বিএনপির সাবেক আহ্বায়ক শাহীদুল ইসলাম চৌধুরী বলেন, বিভিন্ন সন্ত্রাসী কার্যক্রমের জন্য নুরুল আমিনকে দল থেকে বহিষ্কার করা হয়েছিল। তড়িঘড়ি করে তা প্রত্যাহার করে তাঁকে মনোনয়ন দেওয়া হয়। এতে ধানের শীষের প্রার্থীকে জিতিয়ে আনা কঠিন হয়ে পড়বে। এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন) ও ২০০১ সালে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়ী হয়েছিলেন। ১৯৯৬ (উপনির্বাচন) ও ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। মিরসরাইয়ে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন দলের উপজেলা শাখার সেক্রেটারি সাইফুর রহমান। এনসিপির উত্তর জেলার যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক আশরাফ উদ্দিন এবং ইসলামী আন্দোলনের হয়ে ফেরদৌস আহমদ চৌধুরীও মাঠে সক্রিয় রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-২ (ফটিকছড়ি) এই আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী দলের উত্তর জেলা শাখার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক সরওয়ার আলমগীর। তাঁকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণায় ক্ষুব্ধ হয়ে উপজেলা বিএনপির আহ্বায়ক মো. আজিম উল্লাহ বাহারের অনুসারীরা সড়ক অবরোধ করেন। ২০১৮ সালের নির্বাচনে আজিম উল্লাহ দলীয় প্রার্থী ছিলেন। সরোয়ার আলমগীর প্রচারণা শুরু করলেও আজিম উল্লাহ বাহারের অনুসারীরা তাঁর সঙ্গে নেই। ফটিকছড়িতে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (জুন) ও ২০০১ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে জয়ী হন বিএনপির প্রার্থী। এ ছাড়া ১৯৯৬–এর ফেব্রুয়ারিতে স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থী জয়ী হন। ফটিকছড়িতে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী দলের নগর শাখার সেক্রেটারি নুরুল আমিন। এ ছাড়া গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে মিজানুর রহীম চৌধুরী, ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে জুলফিকার আলী এবং বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে আবদুল হামিদ নির্বাচন সামনে রেখে জনসংযোগ করছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৩ (সন্দ্বীপ) বিএনপি এই আসনে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করেনি। দলের মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশীদের মধ্যে রয়েছেন সাবেক সংসদ সদস্য মোস্তফা কামাল পাশা, উত্তর জেলা বিএনপির সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক বেলায়েত হোসেন, বিএনপির কেন্দ্রীয় কমিটির সদস্য মিজানুর রহমান ও তরিকুল আলম। দলীয় সূত্রে জানা গেছে, নির্বাচনী জোট হলে বিএনপি আসনটি এলডিপির জন্য ছেড়ে দিতে পারে। এলডিপির পক্ষ থেকে এই আসনে দলের সভাপতিমণ্ডলীর সদস্য চৌধুরী হাসান সারওয়ার্দীকে মনোনয়ন দেওয়া হয়েছে। এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (জুন) আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী নির্বাচিত হয়। অপরদিকে ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি), ২০০১ ও ২০০৮ সালের নির্বাচনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। সন্দ্বীপে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন দলের উত্তর জেলার আমির আলাউদ্দিন সিকদার। এ ছাড়া আসনটিতে ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে আমজাদ হোসেন এবং গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে তাহসিন মাহমুদকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়েছে। এনসিপি এখনো প্রার্থী দেয়নি। চট্টগ্রাম-৪ (সীতাকুণ্ড) সীতাকুণ্ড আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী উত্তর জেলার সাবেক যুগ্ম আহ্বায়ক কাজী সালাউদ্দিন। প্রার্থী ঘোষণার পর বিএনপির সাবেক যুগ্ম মহাসচিব আসলাম চৌধুরীর অনুসারীরা মহাসড়ক অবরোধ, মানববন্ধনসহ বিভিন্ন কর্মসূচি পালন করেছেন। আসলাম চৌধুরীর পক্ষে রাস্তায় নেমে দল থেকে বহিষ্কার হয়েছেন সাতজন নেতা। কাজী সালাউদ্দিন বলেন, ‘আমি মনোনয়ন চেয়ে জীবনবৃত্তান্তও জমা দিইনি। দল আমাকে মনোনয়ন দিয়েছে।’ তবে মনোনয়ন পাওয়ার বিষয়ে এখনো আশাবাদী আসলাম চৌধুরী। তিনি বলেন, ‘এখনো সময় আছে। ধানের শীষ প্রতীক আমারই থাকবে। আমি নির্বাচন করব।’ এই আসনে ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি) ও ২০০১ সালে বিএনপি জয়ী হয়। ১৯৯৬ (জুন) ও ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। আসনটিতে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী করা হয়েছে দলের উত্তর জেলা শাখার সেক্রেটারি আনোয়ারুল সিদ্দিকীকে। এ ছাড়া এনসিপি থেকে তানজিদ রহমান, গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে জাহিদুল আলম আল জাহিদ, ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে দিদারুল মাওলা, বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে আবুল আসাদ মো. জুবায়ের রেজভী মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৫ (হাটহাজারী ও বায়েজিদের একাংশ) দলের কেন্দ্রীয় সহসাংগঠনিক সম্পাদক মীর মোহাম্মদ হেলাল উদ্দিনকে বিএনপি থেকে প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়। এই আসনে দলের মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশী ছিলেন বিএনপির চেয়ারপারসনের উপদেষ্টা এস এম ফজলুল হক এবং সাবেক সংসদ সদস্য সৈয়দ ওয়াহিদুল আলমের মেয়ে শাকিলা ফারজানা। প্রার্থী পরিবর্তনের দাবিতে ফজলুর হকের অনুসারীরা সড়ক অবরোধসহ নানা কর্মসূচি পালন করছেন। জানতে চাইলে তিনি প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, নেতা-কর্মীরা চাইছেন প্রার্থী পরিবর্তনের বিষয়টি বিবেচনার জন্য। বিএনপির প্রার্থী মীর মোহাম্মদ হেলাল উদ্দিন বলেন, ‘আওয়ামী লীগের নির্যাতন সহ্য করে দীর্ঘ ১৭ বছর হাটহাজারীবাসীর সঙ্গে ছিলাম। ছোটখাটো বিরোধিতায় মানুষ বিভ্রান্ত হবে না।’ জমিয়তে উলামায়ে ইসলামের প্রার্থী হিসেবে হাটহাজারীতে মাঠে রয়েছেন হেফাজতে ইসলামের যুগ্ম মহাসচিব নাছির উদ্দিন মুনির। জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে জনসংযোগ চালিয়ে যাচ্ছেন উপজেলা জামায়াতের সেক্রেটারি আবদুল মালেক। এ ছাড়া ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে মতিউল্লাহ নুরী ও বাংলাদেশ ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে মীর আবদুর রহিম মুনিরী প্রার্থী হিসেবে জনসংযোগ করছেন। তবে এনসিপি এখনো প্রার্থী দেয়নি। ১৯৯১, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন), ২০০১ সালে এই আসনে বিএনপির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের সঙ্গে জোট হয়ে জাতীয় পার্টির প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। রাউজানে বিএনপির প্রার্থী ঘোষণা করা হয়নি। উত্তর জেলা বিএনপির সাবেক আহ্বায়ক গোলাম আকবর খন্দকার ও কেন্দ্রীয় ভাইস চেয়ারম্যান (পদ স্থগিত) গিয়াস উদ্দিন কাদের চৌধুরী মনোনয়নপ্রত্যাশী। স্থানীয় রাজনীতিতে দুজনের বিরোধ দীর্ঘদিনের। রাউজানে গত বছরের ৫ আগস্টের পর সহিংসতায় মোট ১৭টি হত্যাকাণ্ডের ঘটনা ঘটেছে। এর মধ্যে ১২টি রাজনৈতিক হত্যাকাণ্ড বলে জানিয়েছে পুলিশ। বিএনপির দুই নেতার অনুসারীদের কোন্দলের জেরে খুন হন অন্তত ৭ জন। এ ছাড়া একই সময় শতবারের বেশি সংঘর্ষে জড়িয়েছে দুটি পক্ষ। ১৯৯১ সালে এনডিপি, ১৯৯৬ (ফেব্রুয়ারি, জুন) বিএনপি, ২০০১ ও ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগের প্রার্থী জয়লাভ করেন। এই আসনে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী উপজেলা আমির শাহজাহান মঞ্জুর। এ ছাড়া গণসংহতি আন্দোলন থেকে নাসির উদ্দিন তালুকদার, ইসলামী ফ্রন্ট থেকে ইলিয়াস নুরী ও ইসলামী আন্দোলন থেকে জিয়াউর রহমান মাঠে রয়েছেন। চট্টগ্রাম-৭ (রাঙ্গুনিয়া) বিএনপির কেন্দ্রীয় নির্বাহী কমিটির সদস্য হুম্মাম কাদের চৌধুরী দলীয় প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন। তবে দীর্ঘদিন ধরে এলাকায় থাকা উপজেলা বিএনপির আহ্বায়ক কুতুব উদ্দিন বাহার মনোনয়ন না পাওয়ায় তাঁর অনুসারীরা ক্ষুব্ধ। হুম্মামের সঙ্গে তাঁরা মাঠে নামেননি। হুম্মাম কাদের চৌধুরী বলেন, ‘সবার সঙ্গে আমি কথা বলছি, ইতিমধ্যে বসেছি। অনেকেই দলের প্রার্থীর পক্ষে চলে এসেছেন।’ কুতুব উদ্দিন বাহার বলেন, ‘দল এখনো চূড়ান্ত প্রার্থী দেয়নি, তাই অপেক্ষায় রয়েছি। দল যে সিদ্ধান্ত দেবে, সেটি মেনে নেব।’ এই আসনে ১৯৯১ সালে কমিউনিস্ট পার্টি, ১৯৯৬ সালের ফেব্রুয়ারিতে স্বতন্ত্র প্রার্থী (বিএনপির বিদ্রোহী), একই বছরের জুনে বিএনপি, ২০০১ সালে বিএনপি এবং ২০০৮ সালে আওয়ামী লীগ জয় পায়। এই আসনে জামায়াতের প্রার্থী হিসেবে মাঠে রয়েছেন জামায়াত–সমর্থিত ন্যাশনাল ডক্টরস ফোরামের (এনডিএফ) চট্টগ্রাম নগরের সভাপতি এ টি এম রেজাউল করিম। তিনি বলেন, ‘আওয়ামী লীগের হাতে ১৭ বছর জিম্মি থাকা রাঙ্গুনিয়াবাসী পরিবর্তনের অপেক্ষায়।’",

        "body": "২০২৫ সালের শেষ মাসটি ছিল বেশ হতাশাজনক। নির্বিচার গুলি, নানা সংকট আর তীব্র মেরুকরণের খবরের শিরোনামে সংবাদমাধ্যম ভরা ছিল। তবু এ অন্ধকার সময়ের মধ্যেও একটি ইতিবাচক পরিবর্তন ভবিষ্যতের জন্য আশার ইঙ্গিত দিচ্ছে। উন্নয়নশীল বিশ্বের নানা দেশে তরুণ প্রজন্ম এখন জোরালোভাবে চাকরি, সাশ্রয়ী খাদ্য ও জ্বালানি, অর্থনৈতিক সুযোগ ও জলবায়ু পরিবর্তন মোকাবিলায় কার্যকর পদক্ষেপের দাবি তুলছে। দক্ষিণ এশিয়া থেকে লাতিন আমেরিকা পর্যন্ত তারা রাজনৈতিক নেতৃত্বের সামনে পরিষ্কার একটি বার্তা দিচ্ছে, ‘শুনুন ও ব্যবস্থা নিন, নইলে সরে দাঁড়ান।’ নেপাল এর একটি স্পষ্ট উদাহরণ। গত সেপ্টেম্বরে দেশটির সরকার ২৬টি বড় সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যম নিষিদ্ধ করে। এসব প্ল্যাটফর্মে রাজনীতিবিদদের সন্তানদের বিলাসী জীবনযাপন নিয়ে তথ্য প্রকাশ পাচ্ছিল। ফলে দুর্নীতি, স্বজনপ্রীতি ও তরুণদের জন্য সুযোগের অভাব নিয়ে ব্যাপক বিক্ষোভ শুরু হয়। ৭৩ বছর বয়সী প্রধানমন্ত্রী কে পি শর্মা ওলি পরিস্থিতি সামলানোর বদলে রাস্তায় নামা হাজারো কিশোর-তরুণকে নিয়ে বিদ্রূপ করেন। নিরাপত্তা বাহিনীর গুলিতে অন্তত ১৯ জন নিহত ও শতাধিক মানুষ আহত হলে বিক্ষোভকারীরা পার্লামেন্ট ভবনে আগুন দেন এবং ওলির ব্যক্তিগত বাসভবনে হামলা চালান। পরদিনই তিনি পদত্যাগ করেন। অনেকে মনে করেন, এ আন্দোলনের ঢেউ শুরু হয়েছিল ২০২২ সালে শ্রীলঙ্কায়। সে সময় দেশটি ভয়াবহ অর্থনৈতিক বিপর্যয়ে পড়ে। জ্বালানি ও বিদ্যুতের তীব্র সংকটে তরুণদের নেতৃত্বে বড় আন্দোলন গড়ে ওঠে। তাঁরা তৎকালীন ৭২ বছর বয়সী প্রেসিডেন্ট গোতাবায়া রাজাপক্ষের কার্যালয়ের সামনে ক্যাম্প স্থাপন করেন। অভিযোগ ছিল, দীর্ঘদিন ধরে ক্ষমতায় থাকা তাঁর পরিবার দুর্নীতি ও স্বজনপ্রীতিতে জড়িত। একপর্যায়ে বিক্ষোভকারীরা প্রেসিডেন্টের বাসভবনে ঢুকে পড়লে গোতাবায়াকে দেশ ছেড়ে পালাতে হয়। এর দুই বছর পর বাংলাদেশে শিক্ষার্থীরা চাকরিতে কোটা সংস্কারের দাবিতে আন্দোলনে নামেন। সরকার তখন টেলিযোগাযোগ বন্ধ করে দেয় এবং কঠোর পুলিশি দমন চালায়। এতে শত শত সাধারণ মানুষ নিহত হন। কিন্তু এ সহিংসতা আন্দোলন দমন করতে পারেনি; বরং আরও হাজার হাজার মানুষ এতে যুক্ত হন। ঢাকায় বিক্ষোভকারীরা দ্রুত তৎকালীন ৭৬ বছর বয়সী প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার কার্যালয় ও বাসভবনের দিকে মিছিল বের করেন। এর পরপরই তিনি ভারতে পালিয়ে যান। প্রায় একই সময়ে কেনিয়ায় প্রেসিডেন্ট উইলিয়াম রুটোর প্রস্তাবিত কর বৃদ্ধির বিরুদ্ধে জেন–জির নেতৃত্বাধীন আন্দোলন ছড়িয়ে পড়ে। নিরাপত্তা বাহিনীর গুলিতে কয়েক ডজন মানুষ নিহত হন, শতাধিক আহত হন এবং অনেককে বিনা কারণে আটক করা হয়। বিক্ষোভকারীরা সংসদ ভবনে ঢুকে আগুন দিলে রুটো কর বৃদ্ধি প্রত্যাহার করেন এবং তাঁর মন্ত্রিসভার অধিকাংশ সদস্যকে বরখাস্ত করেন। চলতি বছরের জুনে আবারও বিক্ষোভ শুরু হয়, যা জনরোষের গভীরতা স্পষ্ট করে। এদিকে পেরুতে পেনশন সংস্কারের বিরুদ্ধে আন্দোলন ধীরে ধীরে বিস্তৃত হয়ে ওঠে। মানুষ অর্থনৈতিক অনিশ্চয়তা ও ব্যাপক দুর্নীতির বিরুদ্ধে আওয়াজ তোলে। দমন-পীড়ন পরিস্থিতিকে আরও উত্তপ্ত করে তোলে। শেষ পর্যন্ত ঘুষ কেলেঙ্কারিতে তদন্তাধীন প্রেসিডেন্ট দিনা বলুয়ার্তেকে ক্ষমতা থেকে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়। দেশে দেশে দেখা গেছে, জেন–জির নেতৃত্বাধীন এই আন্দোলনগুলো খুব দ্রুত সাধারণ মানুষের ব্যাপক সমর্থন পেয়েছে। তরুণেরা সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যম ব্যবহার করে তথ্য ছড়িয়েছেন, সংগঠন গড়েছেন এবং নেটওয়ার্ক তৈরি করেছেন। সরকার যখন এসব মাধ্যম বন্ধ করেছে, তখন তাঁরা এনক্রিপটেড সার্ভার, এমনকি অনলাইন গেমিং প্ল্যাটফর্মেও সংগঠিত হয়েছেন। আর রাষ্ট্রীয় সহিংসতার মুখে তাঁরা পিছু হটেননি; বরং আন্দোলন আরও জোরালো করেছেন। এ আন্দোলন শুধু একটি প্রজন্ম বা একটি অঞ্চলে সীমাবদ্ধ নয়। ধনী ও দরিদ্র—সব দেশের শ্রমজীবী মানুষের অভিন্ন উদ্বেগই এতে প্রতিফলিত হয়েছে। ২০০৮ সালের আর্থিক সংকট, কোভিড-১৯, ইউক্রেন যুদ্ধ ও ক্রমবর্ধমান অভিবাসন চাপ—এসব মিলিয়ে মজুরি, চাকরির নিরাপত্তা ও মানুষের ক্রয়ক্ষমতা মারাত্মকভাবে ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়েছে। ফলে ক্ষমতাসীন সরকারগুলো ক্রমেই বাস্তবতা থেকে বিচ্ছিন্ন মনে হচ্ছে। তবে জেন–জি আন্দোলনকারীরা রাজনৈতিক ব্যবস্থা ধ্বংস করতে চান না। তাঁরা চান এমন সরকার, যারা চাকরি দেবে, দুর্নীতি দমন করবে এবং জলবায়ু সংকট মোকাবিলায় বিনিয়োগ করবে। এসব দাবি বাস্তবসম্মত এবং এগুলো পূরণের পথও আছে। যুব বেকারত্ব তার একটি উদাহরণ। এক দশক আগে পর্তুগাল, আয়ারল্যান্ড, ইতালি, গ্রিস ও স্পেন—এই ‘পিআইআইজিএস’ দেশগুলো তীব্র ঋণসংকটে ভুগছিল। এখন তাদের চারটি দেশ যুব বেকারত্ব নাটকীয়ভাবে কমিয়েছে। পর্তুগালে ১৫ থেকে ২৪ বছর বয়সীদের বেকারত্ব ২০১৪ সালের ৩৪ দশমিক ৭ শতাংশ থেকে ২০২৫ সালের অক্টোবরে নেমে এসেছে ১৮ দশমিক ৩ শতাংশে। আয়ারল্যান্ডে তা ২৪ দশমিক ২ থেকে কমে হয়েছে ১৩ দশমিক ৪ শতাংশ। গ্রিসে ৫২ দশমিক ৮ থেকে ২০২৪ সালে নেমেছে ২২ দশমিক ৪ শতাংশে। স্পেনে একই সময়ে হার কমেছে ৫৩ দশমিক ২ থেকে ২৬ দশমিক ৫ শতাংশে। এ অগ্রগতির পেছনে বড় ভূমিকা রেখেছে ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের ‘ইয়ুথ গ্যারান্টি’ কর্মসূচি। এ কর্মসূচির আওতায় সরকারগুলো প্রতিশ্রুতি দেয়—স্কুল শেষ করার বা বেকার হওয়ার চার মাসের মধ্যে তরুণদের চাকরি, প্রশিক্ষণ, শিক্ষানবিশ সুযোগ বা পড়াশোনার ব্যবস্থা করা হবে। সব সমস্যা মেটেনি, কিন্তু এটি দেখিয়েছে, রাজনৈতিক সদিচ্ছা থাকলে কী করা সম্ভব। দুর্নীতি দমন অবশ্য আরও কঠিন। আর্মেনিয়া, আজারবাইজান, মলদোভা ও ইউক্রেনের অভিজ্ঞতা তা প্রমাণ করে। তবু অগ্রগতি সম্ভব। এ জন্য দরকার দক্ষ ও ভালো বেতনভুক্ত সরকারি কর্মচারী, শক্তিশালী নজরদারি ও অডিট ব্যবস্থা এবং প্রকৃত রাজনৈতিক জবাবদিহি। ই-গভর্ন্যান্সও সহায়ক হতে পারে। রুয়ান্ডার ডিজিটাল সরকারি ক্রয়ব্যবস্থা দুর্নীতির সুযোগ কমিয়েছে। জর্জিয়ায় পুরোপুরি ইলেকট্রনিক টেন্ডার ব্যবস্থা চালুর ফলে প্রথম দিকে পরিমাপযোগ্য উন্নতি দেখা গেছে। স্বচ্ছতা এখানে অত্যন্ত গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। দুর্নীতি যখন সহনীয় হয়ে ওঠে, তখন তা ছড়িয়ে পড়ে। আর যখন তা প্রকাশ পায়, তখন সামাজিক চাপ ও সুনামের ঝুঁকি দুর্নীতিকে নিরুৎসাহিত করে। তাই হুইসেলব্লোয়ার সুরক্ষা, সহজলভ্য দুর্নীতিবিরোধী তথ্যভান্ডার ও ব্যবসায়িক খাতের দায়িত্বশীল ভূমিকা অপরিহার্য। নাইরি উডস অক্সফোর্ড বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ব্লাভাটনিক স্কুল অব গভর্নমেন্টের ডিন স্বত্ব: প্রজেক্ট সিন্ডিকেট, অনুবাদ: সারফুদ্দিন আহমেদ",

শুধু রংপুরে নয়, এর আগে বিভিন্ন সময়ে ক্ষমতাসীন দলের অনুগত শিক্ষকেরা শিক্ষার্থীদের যেকোনো ন্যায্য দাবির বিরুদ্ধে সরকারের পক্ষ হয়ে কথা বলেছেন, বিরোধিতা করেছেন। এসব শিক্ষক কখনোই শিক্ষার্থীদের শিক্ষক হয়ে উঠতে পারেননি। বরং রাজনৈতিক দলগুলোর শক্তিঘর। তাঁরা সময়–সুযোগ পেলেই পাপেট হয়ে যান। সরকারের কণ্ঠে কথা বলার জন্য বিভিন্ন সময় ‘বিবৃতি’ দিতে ভুল করেন না। নোবেলজয়ী ড. ইউনূসের ওপর হওয়া মামলার পর বিবৃতি দিয়ে শিক্ষক হিসেবে আর এক শিক্ষকের যে চরিত্র আমাদের সামনে তুলে ধরেছিলেন, তা কেবল ন্যক্কারজনকই নয় বরং শিক্ষক পরিচয়ে থাকা রাজনৈতিক নেতা-কর্মী মনে হতো। শুধু শেখ হাসিনা সরকার নয়, অতীতের যেকোনো সময় সরকার বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোয় নিয়োগ দিয়েছে দলীয় অনুগতদের। একাডেমিক যোগ্যতার চেয়ে দলীয় যোগ্যতাকে বড় করে দেখা শিক্ষকদের নিয়োগ দিয়ে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোকে কার্যত অসাড় করে ফেলেছে। কতটা ভয়ানক বিষয় হয়ে উঠেছিল যে শিক্ষকেরা নিয়োগের জন্য ছাত্রনেতাদের দ্বারস্থ হতেন। কতটা অসহায় হলে পদ-পদোন্নতির জন্য ছাত্রনেতাদের টাকাপয়সা দিতেন। একটি পদ পাওয়ার জন্য আবার এসব নেতা কেন্দ্রীয়-স্থানীয় নেতাদের লাখ-কোটি টাকার চুক্তিতে যেতেন। পরবর্তী সময়ে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোর নিয়োগ, টেন্ডার থেকে শুরু করে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের ফলের গাছ ইজারায় নিজেদের বাণিজ্য চালিয়ে গেছেন। তাঁরাই ক্যাম্পাসে গাড়ি নিয়ে ঘুরতেন, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় শেষ করে সংসদ, উপজেলা নির্বাচন করতেন সেই অর্থবিত্তের ছোঁয়ায়। নষ্ট হওয়া ছাত্র ও শিক্ষকরাজনীতি আমাদের উচ্চশিক্ষার যে ক্ষতিটা গত কয়েক দশকে করে গেছে, তা থেকে আমাদের মুক্তি পেতে হবে। আনাচকানাচে রাজনৈতিক সংগঠন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের জন্য নয়। দলীয় নিয়োগে উপাচার্যকে যেমন দলদাস-দুর্নীতিগ্রস্ত হতে আমরা দেখেছি, তেমনি শিক্ষকতার চেয়ে রাজনৈতিক দলের পদ পাওয়াকে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ হিসেবেও দেখেছি। সুবিধাভোগী এসব দলদাস শিক্ষকের কারণে বলি হওয়া প্রকৃত শিক্ষকেরা কোণঠাসা। পদ-পদোন্নতির জন্য রাজনীতিতে জড়িয়ে পড়া শিক্ষকদের ‘শিক্ষা ও গবেষণায়’ ফেরাতে অবশ্যই বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে সব ধরনের রাজনীতি নিষিদ্ধ করা সময়ের দাবি। আবরার হত্যাকাণ্ডের পর যে কাজটি ২০১৯ সালে বুয়েট শুরু করে দিয়েছিল, তাদের গত মার্চে আদালত থামিয়ে দিয়ে ‘গণতন্ত্রের চর্চার’ কথা বলে ছাত্ররাজনীতি ফিরিয়ে দেন। বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের সাধারণ শিক্ষার্থীদের সীমাহীন আপত্তি থাকা সত্ত্বেও আদালত ছাত্ররাজনীতির পক্ষে সায় দিয়েছিলেন। আমরা সেই আইনের জটিলতায় থাকতে চাই না। শিক্ষাঙ্গনে রাজনীতি বন্ধ—এ কাজটি শুরু করতে পারেন একমাত্র আচার্য। দেশের বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোর আচার্য মাননীয় রাষ্ট্রপতি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় পরিচালনা আইনের প্রধান হওয়ায় এ উদ্যোগটি তাঁকেই নিতে হবে। বিশেষ ক্ষমতাবলে দ্রুততম সময়ে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ছাত্র-শিক্ষক ও কর্মকর্তা–কর্মচারীদের রাজনীতিবিদের প্রভুত্ব বন্ধে ‘ক্যাম্পাস রাজনীতি’র প্রতি চিরতরে নিষেধাজ্ঞা জারি তিনিই করতে পারেন, যাতে ভবিষ্যতে কোনো রাজনৈতিক দলই বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোয় রাজনীতি ফেরাতে না পারে। সেটি বন্ধ হলে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের প্রচলিত কাঠামো অনুসারে যদি উপাচার্যরা ক্ষমতায় আসেন, তাহলে তাঁদের আর দলদাসের কোনো সুযোগ থাকবে না, রাজনৈতিক প্রভাব খাটানোর কোনো সুযোগ থাকবে না। বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোয় রাষ্ট্রপতি সর্বক্ষমতার অধিকারী হওয়ায় তিনি প্রয়োজনে সব রাজনৈতিক দলের সঙ্গে আলোচনা করে এই মহান কাজটি করতে পারেন। বৈষম্যবিরোধী শিক্ষার্থীরা নতুন সরকারের কাঁধে এ দাবিটি তুলে দিয়ে নিজেরা সক্রিয় থেকে ছাত্ররাজনীতি বন্ধ করে দিতে পারে। অরাজনৈতিক সংগঠন হিসেবে কেবল ‘ছাত্রসংসদ’ সচল রাখতে পারে, যেখানে কোনো প্রার্থীর রাজনৈতিক পরিচয় থাকবে না আর রাজনৈতিক পরিচয় থাকলে সে ভোটাধিকার বা প্রার্থী হতে পারবে না। শিক্ষক সমিতি থাকার প্রয়োজনীয়তাও নেই। কারণ, বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের সিন্ডিকেট ও অধ্যাদেশ সক্রিয় থাকলে প্রচলিত নিয়মে শিক্ষকদের পদ-পদোন্নতি বাধা হওয়ার সুযোগ নেই। একজন শিক্ষকের প্রধান কাজ হলো শ্রেণিতে পাঠদান ও গবেষণাগারে গবেষণা করা। এ সুযোগটি সরকারকেই করে দিতে হবে। আমার এ দাবিটি রাজনৈতিক বিদ্বেষ থেকে নয়, বরং হাজার হাজার শিক্ষার্থী মনে–প্রাণে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়কে রাজনীতিমুক্ত করতে চায়। আমরাও দীর্ঘদিন থেকে লেখালেখি করছি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোর গুণগত মানোন্নয়নের জন্য। তাই শিক্ষার মানোন্নয়নের স্বার্থে দেশের সকল শিক্ষাপ্রতিষ্ঠানে স্থায়ীভাবে রাজনীতি বন্ধ করতে হবে। আমার মনে হয়, এ কাজটি বুঝে বা করাতে সুবিধা হবে মাননীয় প্রধান উপদেষ্টার। তিনি বিভিন্ন বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে সমাবর্তন বক্তা হিসেবে গেছেন, নানা বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের অধ্যাপকের সঙ্গে তাঁর পরিচিতি আছে। তিনি দেখেছেন বড় বড় সব দেশের বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়গুলোয় আদৌ ছাত্র-শিক্ষকরাজনীতি নেই কিংবা শিক্ষা গবেষণায় একজন শিক্ষক কিংবা শিক্ষার্থীদের তার প্রয়োজনীয়তাই নেই। আমার বিশ্বাস, সেই অভিজ্ঞতার আলোকে, ক্ষমতা গ্রহণের প্রাক্কালে তিনি আমাদের এই দীর্ঘদিনের প্রস্তাবনায় সায় দেবেন। রাষ্ট্রপতিকে নিয়ে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের অধ্যাদেশের সংশোধন আনবেন। আমরা উচ্চশিক্ষায় নতুন দ্বার উন্মোচন করতে চাই, সেই পথ তৈরিতে তিনি সহায়তা করবেন। ড. নাদিম মাহমুদ গবেষক, ক্যালিফোর্নিয়া বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়। ই–মেইল: [email protected]",

        "body": "The police arrested an additional 46 leaders and activists of Awami League, activities of which are now banned, and its affiliated organisations from different parts of Dhaka city allegedly for disrupting law and order by bringing out flash processions. The police have arrested nearly 3,000 leaders and activists of the banned AL and its affiliated organizations from Dhaka city this year for their involvement in flash processions, which have occurred after the interim government in May banned all AL activities pending their trials for alleged atrocities during the July 2024 uprising. Addressing a press conference at the Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Media Centre on Friday afternoon, DMP Deputy Commissioner for media and public relations Talebur Rahman said that police conducted drives in different areas of the city and arrested 46 people while making preparations to bring out flash processions. According to him, 18 were arrested by the police of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police station while four by Khilkhet police station, two by Uttara police station, three by Badda police station, three by Banani police station, three by Tejgaon police station and 13 were arrested by Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime unit. When asked about the total number of arrested AL and its affiliated organisation leaders and activists, the DMP official said that police arrested about 3,000 leaders and activists so far. Legal actions against them are under way, Talebur mentioned. Police in Cumilla also arrested 12 leaders and activists of AL and its affiliated organisations in the early hours of Friday after a flash procession video clip went viral on social media on Thursday, reported New Age Correspondent in Cumilla. Cumilla Kotwali police station officer-in-charge Mohinul Islam said, ‘We conducted a drive and arrested 12 people in connection with the procession. Legal action has been taken against them.’",

        "title": "যে কারণে নতুন বন্ধু খুঁজছেন জার্মান চ্যান্সেলর",
        "body": "তুষারময় শীতকে পেছনে ফেলে জার্মান চ্যান্সেলর ফ্রিডরিখ মের্ৎস দুই দিনের সফরে ভারতে গেছেন। সফর শুরুর দিনেই তিনি জানিয়েছেন, জার্মানি ও ভারতের কূটনৈতিক সম্পর্কের ৭৫ বছর পূর্ণ হয়েছে। দুই দেশের লক্ষ্য রাজনৈতিক ও অর্থনৈতিক সম্পর্ককে আরও গভীর ও শক্তিশালী করা। তবে প্রশ্ন উঠছে, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের আগ্রাসী ও একমুখী পররাষ্ট্রনীতিই কি তার পুরোনো মিত্রদের নতুন বন্ধু খুঁজতে বাধ্য করছে? জার্মানির গণমাধ্যমগুলো এই সফরকে বিশেষ গুরুত্ব দিয়ে তুলে ধরেছে। ইউরোপের অন্যতম প্রধান শক্তি হিসেবে জার্মানি যখন একই সঙ্গে যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ও রাশিয়ার সঙ্গে সম্পর্কে টানাপোড়েনের মধ্য দিয়ে যাচ্ছে, ঠিক সেই সময় জার্মান চ্যান্সেলরের ভারত সফর স্পষ্টতই গভীর রাজনৈতিক তাৎপর্য বহন করছে। এই সফরের কয়েক দিন আগেই, ৮ জানুয়ারি, জার্মানির প্রেসিডেন্ট ফ্রাঙ্ক-ভাল্টার স্টাইনমায়ার বার্লিনে তাঁর ৭০তম জন্মদিন উপলক্ষে আয়োজিত এক সিম্পোজিয়ামে আন্তর্জাতিক রাজনীতি নিয়ে বক্তব্য দেন। সেখানে তিনি যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্পের নেতৃত্বে পরিচালিত মার্কিন পররাষ্ট্রনীতির তীব্র সমালোচনা করে বলেন, বিশ্ব যেন ‘লুটেরাদের আড্ডায়’ পরিণত না হয়। বিশ্বব্যবস্থার ক্রমবর্ধমান ভাঙনের দিকে নীরব দর্শক হয়ে না থাকার আহ্বান জানিয়ে তিনি বলেন, ব্রাজিল ও ভারতের মতো দেশগুলোকে বিশ্বব্যবস্থা রক্ষায় এগিয়ে আসতে রাজি করাতে হবে। জার্মানির প্রেসিডেন্টের এই বক্তব্যের সুর ধরেই ভারত সফররত চ্যান্সেলর ফ্রিডরিখ মের্ৎস বলেন, ভারত যেন কৌশলগত ক্ষেত্রে কেবল রাশিয়ার ওপর নির্ভরশীল হয়ে না পড়ে। তিনি স্পষ্টভাবে জানান, জার্মানি ভারতের সঙ্গে সামরিক ও প্রতিরক্ষা শিল্পে সহযোগিতা বাড়াতে আগ্রহী। জার্মানি সরকারের ওয়েবসাইটে বলা হয়েছে, এই সফরকে বার্লিন বিশেষ সম্মানের নিদর্শন হিসেবে দেখছে। একই সঙ্গে ভারত সরকারও বিষয়টি গুরুত্বের সঙ্গে লক্ষ করেছে যে চ্যান্সেলর তাঁর প্রথম এশিয়া সফরে চীনকে অগ্রাধিকার না দিয়ে আগে ভারতে এসেছেন। যদিও আগামী ফেব্রুয়ারিতে তাঁর চীন সফরের কথা রয়েছে, তবু ভারত সফরের রাজনৈতিক তাৎপর্য দিল্লির কাছে পরিষ্কার বলে মনে করা হচ্ছে। সফরের শুরুতে চ্যান্সেলর সরাসরি রাজধানী নয়াদিল্লিতে না গিয়ে গেছেন ভারতের প্রধানমন্ত্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদির রাজ্য গুজরাটে। মোদির আমন্ত্রণে সেখানে তিনি একটি ঘুড়ি উৎসবে অংশ নেন এবং ভারতের স্বাধীনতাসংগ্রামের নেতা মহাত্মা গান্ধীর একটি স্মৃতিসৌধ পরিদর্শন করেন। রাজনৈতিক আলোচনার পাশাপাশি এই সাংস্কৃতিক ও প্রতীকী কর্মসূচিকে সম্পর্কের উষ্ণতা প্রকাশের অংশ হিসেবে দেখা হচ্ছে। জার্মান ইনস্টিটিউট ফর ইন্টারন্যাশনাল অ্যান্ড সিকিউরিটি অ্যাফেয়ার্সের ভারতবিষয়ক বিশেষজ্ঞ টোবিয়াস শলৎসের মতে, চ্যান্সেলরের এই সফরের সময়টি কৌশলগতভাবে অনুকূল। তাঁর ভাষায়, বর্তমান বৈশ্বিক বাস্তবতা নতুন জোট ও অংশীদারত্ব গঠনের প্রয়োজন তৈরি করেছে, আর সেই প্রেক্ষাপটেই জার্মান সরকার ভারতের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক আরও ঘনিষ্ঠ করতে আগ্রহী। তিনি বলেন, ভারত ও জার্মানির মধ্যে একটি মৌলিক মিল রয়েছে এই জায়গায় যে তারা এমন এক বিশ্ব পরিস্থিতির মুখোমুখি, যেখানে চীন একটি নির্দিষ্ট ঝুঁকি হিসেবে দেখা দিচ্ছে, যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ধীরে ধীরে নির্ভরযোগ্য অংশীদার হিসেবে সরে যাচ্ছে এবং রাশিয়া ক্রমেই আরও বেশি সমস্যাপূর্ণ হয়ে উঠছে। তবে ভারতের সঙ্গে জার্মানির মতভেদও রয়েছে। বিশেষ করে রাশিয়া প্রশ্নে দুই দেশের অবস্থান ভিন্ন। ভারত এখনো বিপুল পরিমাণ জ্বালানি রাশিয়া থেকে আমদানি করে। কিন্তু টোবিয়াস শলৎসের মতে, রাশিয়া ভারতের ভবিষ্যৎ কৌশলগত অংশীদার নয়। জার্মানির রাষ্ট্রীয় টেলিভিশন চ্যানেল এআরডি বলছে, বর্তমান বৈশ্বিক প্রেক্ষাপটে জার্মানি মনে করছে ভারতের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক জোরদার করার একটি বাস্তব সুযোগ তৈরি হয়েছে। একই সঙ্গে ভারতের জন্যও জার্মানি ও ইউরোপের সঙ্গে ঘনিষ্ঠ জোট অর্থনীতি, গবেষণা এবং বিশেষ করে প্রতিরক্ষা খাতে গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। চ্যান্সেলর মের্ৎস ভারতে অস্ত্রশিল্পে সহযোগিতা নিয়ে আলোচনা করতে চান এবং দুই দেশের প্রতিরক্ষা মন্ত্রণালয়ের মধ্যে সমন্বয় জোরদারের পরিকল্পনা রয়েছে। বুন্দেসটাগে জার্মানি-ভারত সংসদীয় দলের দীর্ঘদিনের সদস্য ডির্ক ভিসে বলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে ভারতীয় শিক্ষার্থীরা ক্রমে নানা সমস্যায় পড়ছেন, বিশেষ করে ট্রাম্প প্রশাসনের অধীনে হঠাৎ করে ভিসা বাতিলের ঘটনা বাড়ছে। তাঁর মতে, এসব শিক্ষার্থীকে আরও বেশি করে জার্মানির দিকে আকৃষ্ট করা উচিত। বৈশ্বিক অনিশ্চয়তার প্রেক্ষাপটে জার্মানি ও ভারতের ঐক্যবদ্ধ হওয়া প্রয়োজন বলেও তিনি মনে করেন। বর্তমানে জার্মানিতে প্রায় ৬০ হাজার ভারতীয় শিক্ষার্থী রয়েছেন। এই সফরের সময় স্বাস্থ্যসেবা খাতে ভারতীয় বিশেষজ্ঞ নিয়োগের বিষয়টিও গুরুত্ব পেয়েছে। সফরের দ্বিতীয় দিনে চ্যান্সেলর মের্ৎস জার্মানির শিল্পপ্রতিষ্ঠানের প্রতিনিধিদের নিয়ে বেঙ্গালুরুতে শিল্পাঞ্চল পরিদর্শন করবেন। মেকানিক্যাল ইঞ্জিনিয়ারিং, ফার্মাসিউটিক্যালস, আইটি এবং কাঁচামাল খাতে ভারত জার্মানির কোম্পানিগুলোর জন্য বড় সম্ভাবনার ক্ষেত্র হয়ে উঠছে। দুই দিনের এই সফরে ভারত ও জার্মানি একটি যৌথ ঘোষণাপত্রে স্বাক্ষর করেছে। বর্তমানে ভারতে দুই হাজারেরও বেশি জার্মান কোম্পানি কার্যক্রম পরিচালনা করছে। দুই দেশের দ্বিপক্ষীয় বাণিজ্য অল্প সময়ের মধ্যেই দ্বিগুণ হয়ে বছরে প্রায় ৫০ বিলিয়ন মার্কিন ডলারে পৌঁছেছে। যদিও চীনের সঙ্গে জার্মানির বাণিজ্য এখনো এর পাঁচ গুণ, তবু ভারতের অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধি অনেক দ্রুত, এবং সেই প্রবৃদ্ধিতে অংশ নিতে চায় জার্মানি। চ্যান্সেলর মের্ৎস ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়নের একজন প্রভাবশালী নেতা হিসেবেও ভারতে এসেছেন। দীর্ঘ কয়েক বছর আলোচনার পর জানুয়ারির শেষ দিকে ইউরোপীয় ইউনিয়ন ও ভারতের মধ্যে একটি মুক্ত বাণিজ্যচুক্তি স্বাক্ষরের সম্ভাবনা তৈরি হয়েছে। জার্মানির পত্রিকা ডি সাইট লিখেছে, এই সফর ‘নতুন বিশ্বব্যবস্থায় নতুন বন্ধু খোঁজার’ অংশ। ভারত বিশ্বের অন্যতম বৃহৎ অস্ত্র আমদানিকারক দেশ এবং শীতল যুদ্ধের পর থেকে রাশিয়ার ওপর ব্যাপকভাবে নির্ভরশীল। জার্মানির সরকার এই নির্ভরতা কমাতে চায়। একই সঙ্গে ভারতকে চীনের প্রতিপক্ষ হিসেবে দেখা এবং সেই বিবেচনায় ভারতের সঙ্গে সম্পর্ক জোরদার করাও বার্লিনের কৌশলের অংশ। সময়টি উভয় দেশের জন্যই অনুকূল বলে মনে করা হচ্ছে। যুক্তরাষ্ট্র বর্তমানে ভারতের ওপর উচ্চ শুল্ক আরোপ করেছে, যা জার্মানির ক্ষেত্রেও বিভিন্নভাবে প্রযোজ্য। অন্যদিকে নিষেধাজ্ঞা সত্ত্বেও ভারত রাশিয়া থেকে নির্বিঘ্নে তেল কিনছে। মাত্র এক মাস আগে দিল্লিতে প্রধানমন্ত্রী মোদি যেভাবে রুশ প্রেসিডেন্ট ভ্লাদিমির পুতিনকে উষ্ণ অভ্যর্থনা জানিয়েছিলেন, প্রায় একই উষ্ণতায় স্বাগত জানানো হয়েছে জার্মান চ্যান্সেলর মের্ৎসকেও। ভারতের সঙ্গে সুসম্পর্ক থেকে জার্মানির সরকার ঠিক কী অর্জন করতে চায়, আর ভারত সত্যিই রাশিয়ার ওপর নির্ভরতা কমাতে পারবে কি না—এই প্রশ্নগুলোর উত্তর আগামী দিনগুলোতে আরও স্পষ্ট হবে। তবে নতুন বিশ্বব্যবস্থায় জার্মানি যে নতুন মিত্র খুঁজছে, তা এই সফরের মধ্য দিয়ে স্পষ্ট হয়ে উঠেছে। সরাফ আহমেদ প্রথম আলোর জার্মানি প্রতিনিধি। ই–মেইল: [email protected]",

        "body": "মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প ভারত ও প্রধানমন্ত্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদিকে আক্রমণ করে নানা মন্তব্য করেছেন। তবে এরপরও নয়াদিল্লি বা মোদি সরকার কোনো প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখাচ্ছে না। রাজনৈতিক চাপ থাকলেও কেন সরকার চুপ—এসব নিয়ে দ্য ইন্ডিয়ান এক্সপ্রেসে প্রতিবেদন করেছেন শুভজিৎ রায়। আজ বৃহস্পতিবার সংবাদমাধ্যমটি তাদের অনলাইন সংস্করণে সেটি প্রকাশ করেছে। মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প সম্প্রতি দাবি করেছেন, ‘ভারতের প্রধানমন্ত্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদি আমার সঙ্গে দেখা করতে এসেছিলেন এবং বলেছিলেন, “স্যার, আমি কি আপনার সঙ্গে দেখা করতে পারি, প্লিজ?” জবাবে আমি বলেছিলাম “হ্যাঁ।”’ মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্টের এমন মন্তব্য দিল্লিতে একটি অস্বস্তিকর পরিস্থিতির সৃষ্টি করেছে। তবে দিল্লি আপাতত এর কোনো আনুষ্ঠানিক জবাব না দেওয়ার সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছে। ভারত ও মোদিকে নিশানা করে ট্রাম্প এই প্রথম এমন মন্তব্য করলেন, বিষয়টা তেমন নয়। তবে নয়াদিল্লি বরাবরই সংযত থেকেছে। গত মঙ্গলবার ট্রাম্প বলেছিলেন, মোদি তাঁর ওপর ‘খুব একটা খুশি নন’। কারণ, রাশিয়ার তেল কেনার শাস্তিস্বরূপ ওয়াশিংটন দিল্লির ওপর বাড়তি ২৫ শতাংশ শুল্ক আরোপ করেছে। ফলে ভারতের ওপর মোট শুল্ক দাঁড়িয়েছে ৫০ শতাংশে। ট্রাম্প আরও বলেন, ভারত তাঁকে জানিয়েছে, তারা অ্যাপাচি হেলিকপ্টারের জন্য পাঁচ বছর ধরে অপেক্ষা করছে। তিনি বলেন, ‘আমরা এটা পাল্টাচ্ছি...ভারত ৬৮টি অ্যাপাচির ক্রয়াদেশ দিয়েছে।’ দিল্লির সরকারি সূত্রগুলো অবশ্য ট্রাম্পের এ দাবি অস্বীকার করে বলেছে, ভারত যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে মাত্র ২৮টি অ্যাপাচি হেলিকপ্টার কিনেছে, যার মধ্যে ২২টি বিমানবাহিনীর জন্য এবং ৬টি ভারতীয় সেনাবাহিনীর জন্য। সব কটি হেলিকপ্টার ইতিমধ্যেই বুঝিয়ে দেওয়া হয়েছে। ২২টি অ্যাপাচি হেলিকপ্টারের প্রথম চুক্তিটি ওবামা প্রশাসনের সময় ২০১৫ সালের সেপ্টেম্বরে সই হয়েছিল। ট্রাম্প প্রশাসনের প্রথম মেয়াদে সেগুলো সরবরাহ করা হয়েছিল। ছয়টি হেলিকপ্টারের দ্বিতীয় চুক্তিটি ২০২০ সালের ফেব্রুয়ারিতে ট্রাম্পের ভারত সফরের সময় সই হয়েছিল। সেগুলোর সরবরাহে কিছুটা দেরি হয়েছিল এবং ২০২৪ সালের শুরুর বদলে ২০২৫ সালের ডিসেম্বরের মধ্যে সব কটি হেলিকপ্টার সরবরাহ করা হয়েছে। মূলত ২০২৫ সালের ফেব্রুয়ারিতে মোদির হোয়াইট হাউস সফরের সময় এই হেলিকপ্টার সরবরাহের বিষয়টি আলোচনার অংশ ছিল। ট্রাম্পের মন্তব্যের কড়া জবাব দেওয়ার জন্য ভারতে রাজনৈতিক চাপ বাড়লেও কূটনৈতিক মহল সংযত থাকার এবং রাজনৈতিক পরিপক্বতা দেখানোর পরামর্শ দিয়েছে। কূটনৈতিক সূত্রগুলো পরামর্শ দিয়েছে, এ ধরনের পাল্টা জবাব প্রায়ই ‘উল্টো ফল’ বয়ে আনে। এখন কোনো ‘তর্কে জেতার’ অর্থ হয় না, বিশেষ করে যখন ভারত-যুক্তরাষ্ট্র বাণিজ্যচুক্তি নিয়ে কাজ চলছে। ভারতের এই সংবাদমাধ্যমকে একটি সূত্র বলেছে, ‘মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্ট যা বলছেন, তাঁর প্রতিমুহূর্তের ধারাভাষ্য দেওয়ার কোনো প্রয়োজন নেই। সেটার বদলে আমাদের বাণিজ্য আলোচনার দিকে মনোযোগ দেওয়া উচিত এবং এটাই আমাদের অগ্রাধিকার।’ ট্রাম্প ২০২৫ সালের আগস্টেও একই ধরনের মন্তব্য করেছিলেন। তখন তিনি দাবি করেছিলেন, তিনি মোদিকে বলেছিলেন, যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ভারতের সঙ্গে ‘কোনো চুক্তি করবে না’ অথবা ‘আমরা তোমাদের ওপর এত বেশি শুল্ক আরোপ করব যে তোমাদের মাথা ঘুরে যাবে।’ ওই সময় যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ৫০ শতাংশ শুল্ক আরোপ করার পর ট্রাম্প বলেছিলেন, ‘আমি চমৎকার একজন মানুষের সঙ্গে কথা বলছি, নরেন্দ্র মোদি। আমি বললাম, “আপনার আর পাকিস্তানের মধ্যে কী হচ্ছে?”’ ট্রাম্প বলেন, ‘ঘৃণাটা ছিল প্রচণ্ড। এটা অনেক দিন ধরে চলছে, শত বছর ধরে আলাদা আলাদা নামে...আমি বললাম, আমি আপনাদের সঙ্গে কোনো বাণিজ্যচুক্তি করতে চাই না...আপনারা তো পারমাণবিক যুদ্ধে জড়াবেন...আমি বললাম, কাল আমাকে ফোন দিয়েন। কিন্তু আমরা কোনো চুক্তি করব না, না হলে এত শুল্ক বসাব যে আপনাদের মাথা ঘুরে যাবে...পাঁচ ঘণ্টার মধ্যে সব ঠিক হয়ে গেল। হয়তো আবার শুরু হবে, কিন্তু তেমনটা হলে আমি তা থামিয়ে দেব।’ বিগত কয়েক মাসে নয়াদিল্লি মার্কিন প্রেসিডেন্টের ভুল তথ্য সংশোধন করে দিয়েছে। তবে ২০২৫ সালের মে মাসে ভারত-পাকিস্তান সংঘাত থামানোর কৃতিত্ব নেওয়া থেকে তাঁকে ভারত আটকাতে পারেনি। গত বুধবার লুক্সেমবার্গে প্রবাসী ভারতীয়দের সঙ্গে আলাপকালে পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী এস জয়শঙ্কর বলেছেন, অনেক দূরে থাকা দেশগুলো বলছে, উত্তেজনা বাড়লে তারা চিন্তিত হয়। কিন্তু তারা নিজেদের অঞ্চলের ঝুঁকিগুলো দেখে না। জয়শঙ্কর বলেন, ‘তাই যারা আমাদের সঙ্গে কাজ করতে ইচ্ছুক এবং সহায়ক, আমাদের তাদের সঙ্গে সেভাবেই চলতে হবে। আর যারা পাকিস্তানের মতো কাজ করে, তাদের সঙ্গে আমাদের অন্যভাবে ডিল করতে হবে।’ ভারতের পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী আরও বলেন, ‘এখন বিশ্বের অন্য প্রান্তের ঘটনাগুলো আমাদের কতটা প্রভাবিত করছে? তা বলা কঠিন। দূরে বসে থাকা মানুষ অনেক কথা বলবে—কখনো মাথা খাটিয়ে, কখনো না বুঝে, কখনো স্বার্থপরের মতো, আবার কখনো অসতর্কভাবে। এমনটা ঘটবেই।’ জয়শঙ্কর বলেন, ‘তবে দিনশেষে আমি বলতে পারি, আজকের যুগে দেশগুলো অনেক বেশি...আমি স্বার্থপর বলতে চাই না, তবে তারা কেবল নিজেদের সরাসরি উপকারে আসবে—এমন কাজই করে। তারা আপনাকে বিনা মূল্যে পরামর্শ দেবে। কিছু ঘটলে বলবে না যে দয়া করে এমন করবেন না, উত্তেজনা হলে আমাদের দুশ্চিন্তা হয়।’ পাকিস্তানের বিরুদ্ধে ‘অপারেশন সিঁদুর’ নাম দিয়ে পাকিস্তানের বিরুদ্ধে হামলা চালানোর সময়টা মনে করিয়ে জয়শঙ্কর বলেন, ওই সময় অনেক দেশ ভারতকে কীভাবে চলা উচিত, সে বিষয়ে পরামর্শ দিয়েছিল। ভারত সেটাকে জগতের নিয়ম হিসেবে মেনে নিয়ে এগিয়ে গিয়েছিল।",

        "body": "অচেনা বা বিদেশি মানুষ ও সংস্কৃতির প্রতি ঘৃণা ও ভয় বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশের মতো ভারতেও বাড়ছে। বিদ্বেষমূলক মনোভাবের কারণে স্থানীয় বাসিন্দারা অনেক সময় আগন্তুকদের প্রতি সহিংস হয়ে ওঠেন। ঘটে গণপিটুনির মতো ঘটনা। ভারতে বিজেপির টানা তৃতীয় মেয়াদের শাসনে সমাজে ঘৃণা-বিদ্বেষ বেড়েছে। তারপরও সরকারের তেমন কোনো পদক্ষেপ নেই। চলতি মাসে ভারতের বিভিন্ন রাজ্যে বিদেশি সন্দেহে অন্তত তিনজনকে পিটিয়ে মারা হয়েছে। এই ভয়ংকর প্রবণতা নিয়ে দেশটির সংবাদমাধ্যম দ্য টাইমস অব ইন্ডিয়া গতকাল রোববার একটি সম্পাদকীয় প্রকাশ করেছে। ভিন্ন একটি দিন, ভিন্ন একটি রাজ্য, ভিন্ন একটি রোমহর্ষক গণপিটুনির ঘটনা। চলতি মাসে এটি নিয়ে এ রকম তিনটি ঘটনা ঘটল। তাই বলতে হয়, লজ্জা ও আতঙ্কজনক একটি পাদটীকা নিয়ে বছরটি বিদায় নিচ্ছে। এমন একটি বছর শেষ হতে চলেছে, যেখানে আমরা ‘অপর করে দেওয়া’ (আদারিং) ধীরে ধীরে স্বাভাবিক হয়ে উঠতে দেখছি। প্রশ্ন উঠেছে—তরুণ ও কর্মজীবী মানুষ কি নিজ দেশে নির্ভয়ে-নিরাপদে চলাফেরা করতে পারবেন না? উত্তরাখন্ডের একদল মানুষ সম্প্রতি দেরাদুনে এক তরুণকে ছুরিকাঘাত করে। ২৪ বছর বয়সী ভুক্তভোগী তরুণ এমবিএ শিক্ষার্থী ছিলেন। এক বছর ধরে তিনি ওই শহরে থাকছিলেন। তাঁকে নিয়ে বর্ণবিদ্বেষী কটূক্তি করা হলেও তিনি শান্ত ছিলেন। তা সত্ত্বেও হামলাকারীরা তাঁকে ছুরিকাঘাতে ক্ষতবিক্ষত করে। পরে তিনি চিকিৎসাধীন অবস্থায় হাসপাতালে মারা যান। চলতি মাসে আরও দুজন পরিযায়ী শ্রমিক গণপিটুনিতে নিহত হয়েছেন। একজন ওডিশায়। তাঁর বয়স ১৯-২০ বছর। আরেকজন কেরালা রাজ্যের ছত্তিশগড়ে। তাঁর বয়স ৩১ বছর। তাঁরা উভয়ে বাঙালি। তাঁদের ‘বাংলাদেশি’ তকমা দিয়ে পিটিয়ে মারা হয়েছিল। কিন্তু তাঁরা বাংলাদেশি ছিলেন না। এ দুই ঘটনা সারা দেশে প্রান্তিক পরিযায়ী শ্রমিকদের নিরাপত্তাঝুঁকি বৃদ্ধির ইঙ্গিত দিচ্ছে। আফ্রিকা ও ভারতের উত্তর-পূর্বাঞ্চলের শিক্ষার্থী ও শ্রমিকেরা কয়েক দশক ধরে দিল্লিসহ উত্তর ভারতের নানা রাজ্যে বর্ণবিদ্বেষের শিকার হচ্ছেন। কিন্তু এখন পর্যন্ত কোনো সরকার বর্ণবাদ বা বিদ্বেষপ্রসূত অপরাধের কথা আনুষ্ঠানিকভাবে স্বীকার করেনি। উল্টো বিপজ্জনক দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি এবং চরম সহিংসতাকে পুলিশ প্রায় সময় ‘বিচ্ছিন্ন ঘটনা’ বলে দায় সারে, যা আদতে বিচ্ছিন্ন নয়। এই বর্ণবাদ ও ‘আদারিং’–এর সুস্পষ্ট ধরন আছে। তারপরও এসবের বিরুদ্ধে পদক্ষেপ না থাকায়, এসব ঘটনা এখন ঘন ঘন ঘটছে এবং নগ্ন-সহিংস রূপ নিচ্ছে। ভারতীয় শিক্ষার্থীরাও বিদেশে, বিশেষ করে ট্রাম্পের আমেরিকায় বর্ণবিদ্বেষের শিকার হচ্ছেন। ভারতের সুবিধাভোগী ও উচ্চবিত্তরা পশ্চিমা দেশে নিজেদের ‘অ-শ্বেতাঙ্গ’ হিসেবে চিহ্নিত হতে দেখে এবং সেসব দেশে যেসব জনগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের দিকে অনেক সময় তাচ্ছিল্যভরে তাকানো হয়, সেই জনগোষ্ঠীর সঙ্গে নিজেদের এক কাতারে দেখে হতভম্ব হয়ে যেতেন। কিন্তু তাঁরা এখন ট্রাম্পের ‘মেক আমেরিকা গ্রেট অ্যাগেইন’ (এমএজিএ—যা মাগা নামে পরিচিত) প্রচারের ধাঁচে আগের যেকোনো সময়ের চেয়ে বেশি আদারিংয়ের শিকার হচ্ছেন। কিন্তু অন্য দেশে ভুক্তভোগী হলেও নিজ সমাজে বিদ্যমান বর্ণবাদী মনোভাব নিয়ে আমরা চুপ। সরকারের ন্যাশনাল ইনস্টিটিউশন ফোর ট্রান্সফর্মিং ইন্ডিয়া বা নীতি আয়োগের এক প্রতিবেদনে বলা হয়েছে, ভারতের কেন্দ্র ও রাজ্য পরিচালিত বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ২০৩০ সালের মধ্যে এক লাখ আন্তর্জাতিক শিক্ষার্থী পড়াশোনা করতে আসবেন বলে আশা করা হচ্ছে। কিন্তু বর্ণ ও গায়ের রঙের প্রশ্নে বিদেশি শিক্ষার্থীদের নিরাপত্তা শতভাগ নিশ্চিত করা না গেলে, তা সম্ভব হবে না। ভারতের উত্তর-পূর্বাঞ্চলের মানুষ অনেক দিন ধরে অভিযোগ করে আসছেন, তাঁরা নিজ দেশে আদারিংয়ের শিকার হচ্ছেন। মনে রাখতে হবে, এটা বৃদ্ধি হতে দিলে রাজনৈতিক প্রতিক্রিয়া অনিবার্য। আদারিং দ্রুতগতিতে বিস্তার লাভ করলেও বছরের পর বছর ধরে সরকার বিষয়টির প্রতি উদাসীনতা দেখিয়েছে। সামাজিক যোগাযোগমাধ্যমের অপপ্রচার ও ভুয়া খবর বা বাস্তব জীবনে বিদেশিদের প্রতি বিদ্বেষপূর্ণ মনোভাব পরিযায়ী শ্রমিকদের জীবনকে বিপজ্জনক করে তুলেছে। দেখা গেছে, অপরাধীরা সহজে পার পেয়ে যায়। পুলিশ ও সরকার ঘটনা ঘটার পরই কেবল প্রতিক্রিয়া দেখায়। বেশ কয়েক বছর আগে গুজব রটেছিল—‘শহরে অপহরণকারীরা’ ঘুরে বেড়াচ্ছে। ফলে গণপিটুনির ঘটনা বেড়ে গিয়েছিল। তখন পুলিশের কঠোর মনোভাবের কারণে মিথ্যা প্রচার নিয়ন্ত্রণে এসেছিল। রাজনৈতিকভাবে অস্থির পশ্চিমবঙ্গ, আসাম ও কেরালার বিধানসভা নির্বাচনের আগে ‘অবৈধ অনুপ্রবেশকারী’–বিষয়ক জুজু অসহিষ্ণুতাকে ব্যাপকভাবে বাড়িয়ে দিচ্ছে। আদারিং একধরনের পদ্ধতিগত বিষ। এর বিস্তার রোধে দৃঢ় পদক্ষেপ নিতে হবে। তা না হলে সরকারকে শেষ পর্যন্ত প্রত্যেক নাগরিককে একে অপরের কাছ থেকে সুরক্ষা দিতে হবে।",

        "body": "ভারতে বাংলাদেশিদের নিরাপত্তা–শঙ্কা থাকায় টি-টুয়েন্টি বিশ্বকাপের ম্যাচ খেলতে সে দেশে দল না পাঠানোর সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছে বাংলাদেশ ক্রিকেট বোর্ড (বিসিবি)। আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেট কাউন্সিল (আইসিসি) সিদ্ধান্ত পুনর্বিবেচনা করতে বললেও বিসিবি নিজেদের সিদ্ধান্তে অনড় রয়েছে। দুই পক্ষের মধ্যে সর্বশেষ যে ভিডিও কনফারেন্স হয়েছে, তাতে বাংলাদেশের আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ বর্তমানে ভারতে কোনো রকম নিরাপত্তা–সংকট ছাড়াই আম্পায়ারিং করছেন বলে আইসিসির বক্তব্যে তুলে ধরা হয়। ভারতের বিভিন্ন গণমাধ্যমেও কয়েক দিন ধরে শরফুদ্দৌলার ভারতের ম্যাচে দায়িত্ব পালন নিয়ে খবর প্রকাশ করেছে। বাংলাদেশি আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ চলমান ভারত-নিউজিল্যান্ড ওয়ানডে সিরিজের আম্পায়ার প্যানেলে আছেন। ১১ জানুয়ারি বড়োদরায় সিরিজের প্রথম ওয়ানডের পর গতকাল রাজকোটে সিরিজের দ্বিতীয় ওয়ানডেতেও তিনি তৃতীয় আম্পায়ারের দায়িত্বে ছিলেন। এমনকি ১৮ জানুয়ারি ইন্দোরে সিরিজের শেষ ওয়ানডেতে তাঁকে অনফিল্ড আম্পায়ার হিসেবেও দেখা যেতে পারে। শরফুদ্দৌলার ভারতে অবস্থান ও ভারতের ম্যাচ পরিচালনায় অংশগ্রহণের কারণে কারও কারও প্রশ্ন—বিসিবি যখন নিরাপত্তা শঙ্কায় দল পাঠাচ্ছে না, তখন শরফুদ্দৌলা কীভাবে ভারতে আম্পায়ারিং করছেন? আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেট সিরিজে আম্পায়ার ও ম্যাচ রেফারি নিযুক্ত করে আইসিসি। প্রতিটি ম্যাচ বা সিরিজে কোন কোন আম্পায়ার দায়িত্ব পালন করবেন, তা নির্ধারণে আইসিসি কিছু মানদণ্ড অনুসরণ করে। আইসিসি ওয়েবসাইটে এ বিষয়ে কিছু ধারণা দেওয়া হয়েছে। যেমন ম্যাচ বা সিরিজে অংশগ্রহণকারী দেশগুলোর প্রভাবমুক্ত বা নিরপেক্ষ থাকা, ওই সময়ে দায়িত্ব পালনের জন্য উন্মুক্ত থাকাদের মধ্যে সেরা অপেক্ষাকৃত ভালো পারফর্ম করা আম্পায়ারদের বেশি সুযোগ দেওয়া, একই দলের ম্যাচে নির্দিষ্ট কোনো আম্পায়ারের বারবার দায়িত্ব পালনের বিষয়টি এড়ানো এবং কাজের চাপের বিষয়ে লক্ষ্য রাখা। বলে রাখা ভালো, আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেটে শুরু থেকে দীর্ঘদিন পর্যন্ত আম্পায়ার নিয়োগ করত আয়োজক দেশের বোর্ড। ১৯৯৩ সালে আইসিসি প্রতিটি টেস্ট ম্যাচে একজন করে নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার দেওয়ার কার্যক্রম শুরু করে। পরে যা ওয়ানডেতেও কার্যকর হয়। নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার হিসেবে নিয়োগ দেওয়ার সুবিধার্থে ক্রিকেটের নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা ২০০২ সালে এলিট প্যানেল গঠন করে। দুই দশকের বেশি সময় ধরে এই এলিট প্যানেল থেকেই দুটি পূর্ণ সদস্যদেশের দ্বিপক্ষীয় সিরিজ ও আইসিসি টুর্নামেন্টের জন্য আম্পায়ার বাছাই করা হয়। তবে এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়ার বেশি নয় বলে বড় টুর্নামেন্টগুলোতে আন্তর্জাতিক প্যানেল থেকেও আম্পায়ার নেওয়া হয়। আম্পায়ারদের মোট চারটি প্যানেল আছে। প্রথমটি হচ্ছে ন্যাশনাল আম্পায়ার, যাঁরা মূলত সংশ্লিষ্ট দেশের ক্রিকেট বোর্ডের অধীন। ঘরোয়া প্রথম শ্রেণির ম্যাচ, লিস্ট ‘এ’ ও টি-টুয়েন্টি পর্যন্ত আম্পায়ারিং করতে পারেন তাঁরা। পরের ধাপে আছে আইসিসি ইন্টারন্যাশনাল আম্পায়ার্স প্যানেল। এই ধাপের আম্পায়াররা ঘরের মাঠে ওয়ানডে ও আন্তর্জাতিক টি-টোয়েন্টি পরিচালনা করতে পারেন। তৃতীয় ধাপকে বলা হয় আইসিসি ইমার্জিং আম্পায়ার প্যানেল, যা মূলত এলিট প্যানেলে যাওয়ার আগে সর্বশেষ ধাপ। আম্পায়ারদের সর্বোচ্চ স্তর হচ্ছে আইসিসি এলিট আম্পায়ার প্যানেল। এই প্যানেলে থাকা আম্পায়াররা নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার হিসেবে টেস্ট ও ওয়ানডে ম্যাচে দায়িত্ব পালন করেন। বর্তমানে এলিট প্যানেলে আম্পায়ার আছেন ১২ জন। তাঁদের মধ্যে বাংলাদেশের একমাত্র আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ। ২০২৪ সালের মার্চ এলিট প্যানেলে অন্তর্ভুক্ত হন তিনি, যা বাংলাদেশের আম্পায়ারদের মধ্যে প্রথম। এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়াররা সরাসরি আইসিসির সঙ্গে চুক্তিবদ্ধ। আইসিসি যখন যেখানে পাঠায়, সেখানেই দায়িত্ব পালন করতে যান। যেমন গত মাসে অস্ট্রেলিয়া-ইংল্যান্ডের অ্যাশেজে ব্রিসবেন টেস্টে মাঠে ছিলেন তিনি। মাঝখানে কয়েক দিন বিপিএলে ম্যাচ পরিচালনা করে এখন গেছেন ভারত-নিউজিল্যান্ড সিরিজে। শরফুদ্দৌলা বিসিবি আয়োজিত টুর্নামেন্টে আম্পায়ারিং করেন। তবে আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেটে আম্পায়ারিংয়ের জন্য তিনি আইসিসির আওতাধীন। এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়ার হওয়ায় বিসিবির কাছ থেকে তাঁর ছাড়পত্র নেওয়ার বিষয় নেই। এ বিষয়ে বিসিবি পরিচালক ইফতেখার রহমান পরিষ্কার করেই বলেছেন, ‘তিনি আইসিসির চুক্তিবদ্ধ আম্পায়ার। আমাদের সঙ্গে চুক্তিবদ্ধ নন। আমাদের সঙ্গে যে চুক্তি, সেটা হচ্ছে যখনই তাঁর আইসিসির দায়িত্ব থাকবে, তিনি চলে যাবেন। এখানে অনাপত্তিপত্র দেওয়ার বিষয় নেই। অ্যাগ্রিমেন্টেই আছে, আইসিসির কাজ থাকলে স্বয়ংক্রিয়ভাবে তিনি অবমুক্ত। তাঁকে কোথাও যেতে দেওয়ার অনুমতি দেওয়া বা না দেওয়ার কোনো এখতিয়ার আমাদের নেই।’",

        "body": "অপেক্ষা, তীক্ষ্ণ নিরীক্ষণ ও ক্ষোভ প্রশমিত হওয়ার জন্য প্রতীক্ষা ছাড়া শ্রীলঙ্কা পরিস্থিতিতে এই মুহূর্তে ভারতের করার কিছুই নেই। দেশটির ঘটনাপ্রবাহ কোন দিকে গড়ায়, তা না দেখে ভারত আগ বাড়িয়ে এমন কিছুই করতে চায় না, যাতে মনে হতে পারে এই সংকটে তারা কোনো বিশেষ পক্ষকে সঙ্গ দিচ্ছে। ভারত বারবার এটাই বুঝিয়ে দিচ্ছে, সম্পর্কটা দুই দেশের জনগণের মধ্যে এবং এ সংকটে ভারত দৃঢ়ভাবে শ্রীলঙ্কার জনগণের সঙ্গে রয়েছে। পাশাপাশি এটাও বুঝিয়ে দেওয়া হচ্ছে, সংকট থেকে পরিত্রাণের জন্য ভারত ইতিমধ্যেই শ্রীলঙ্কাকে ৩ দশমিক ৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার আর্থিক সহায়তা দিয়েছে। জ্বালানি, খাদ্য, ওষুধ, সার ও অন্যান্য আবশ্যক পণ্য সরবরাহ করেছে। ত্রাণের বিষয়ে শ্রীলঙ্কার সঙ্গে ঘনিষ্ঠ সম্পর্কও রেখে চলছে। ভারতের পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী এস জয়শঙ্করের কথায়, ‘দেশটি সমস্যার মধ্য দিয়ে চলছে। সংকট গভীর। এই অবস্থা হুট করে শুরু হয়নি। কীভাবে তারা এর মোকাবিলা করে, তা দেখতে আমরা অপেক্ষায় আছি।’ ভারতের অপেক্ষা দুটি ক্ষেত্রে। প্রথমটি অবশ্যই অর্থনৈতিক সংকট। জনগণকে কিছুটা সুরাহা দিতে দেশটি কী করে, সেদিকে ভারত আগ্রহ নিয়ে অপেক্ষা করছে। পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের এক সূত্রের মতে, মূল্যস্ফীতি দিন দিন বেড়ে চলেছে। ফলে জনতার ক্ষোভও বাড়ছে। দ্রুত এর সামাল দিতে না পারলে অভ্যন্তরীণ পরিস্থিতি হাতের বাইরে চলে যেতে পারে। তেমন হলে অর্থনৈতিক সংকট অন্য ধরনের জাতিগত সমস্যার জন্ম দিতে পারে। দ্বিতীয় অপেক্ষা রাজনৈতিক। এই বিষয়ে ভারত আরও সতর্ক। সংকটের প্রথম দিকে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্রের কোনো কোনো স্বার্থান্বেষী মহল এমন একটা ধারণা দিতে চেয়েছিল যে ক্ষমতাসীন রাজাপক্ষে পরিবারকে জনরোষ থেকে ভারত বাঁচাতে চাইছে। তাদের দেশত্যাগে মদদ দিচ্ছে। পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের সূত্রটির কথায়, দ্রুত ওই ধারণা নস্যাৎ করা সম্ভব হয়েছে। সে দেশের হাইকমিশন থেকে বিবৃতি দিয়ে বলা হয়েছে, এ-সংক্রান্ত প্রচার একেবারেই মনগড়া, ভিত্তিহীন ও অনুমাননির্ভর। স্পষ্ট করে ভারত তখন থেকেই জানিয়ে আসছে, সরকার নয়, ভারত দৃঢ়ভাবে রয়েছে শ্রীলঙ্কার জনগণের সঙ্গে। গণতন্ত্রের সঙ্গে। ভারতের অবস্থান সে দেশের সংবিধানের পক্ষে। শ্রীলঙ্কার সমৃদ্ধি ও উন্নতিই ভারতের কাম্য। বিদায়ী সরকার অথবা কোনো রাজনৈতিক দলের পক্ষই যে ভারত নিচ্ছে না, বারবার সে কথা মনে করিয়ে দেওয়ার মধ্য দিয়ে এটা স্পষ্ট যে ওই দেশের রাজনৈতিক পটপরিবর্তনের চরিত্র কী হতে চলেছে, সে বিষয়ে কোনো ধারণা ভারতীয় নেতৃত্বের এখনো নেই। পাশাপাশি জনগণের সঙ্গে থাকার কথা মনে করিয়ে দেওয়ার মধ্য দিয়ে বোঝানো হচ্ছে, বিপদের সময় প্রতিবেশীর পাশে দৃঢ়ভাবে দাঁড়াতে ভারত বদ্ধপরিকর। এ-ও বোঝাচ্ছে, পরিবর্তন যা-ই হোক, তা যেন গণতান্ত্রিক উপায়ে শান্তিপূর্ণভাবে হয়। ভারতের পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের পক্ষ থেকে বারবার বলা হচ্ছে, ওই দেশে সামরিক হস্তক্ষেপের কোনো প্রশ্নই ওঠে না। রাজনৈতিক ও অর্থনৈতিক ডামাডোল শুরু হওয়ার সময় উদ্বাস্তু-সংক্রান্ত একটা শঙ্কা ভারতের মনে উঁকি দিয়েছিল। কিন্তু সম্প্রতি সেই আশঙ্কা থেকেও ভারত মুক্ত। ভারতের ইনস্টিটিউট ফর ডিফেন্স স্টাডিজ অ্যান্ড অ্যানালাইসিসের (আইডিএসএ) গবেষক স্মৃতি পট্টনায়ক গতকাল শনিবার প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, এটা ঠিক যে শ্রীলঙ্কার নিরাপত্তা, অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধি ও স্থিতিশীলতার সঙ্গে ভারতের স্বার্থ ঘনিষ্ঠ সম্পর্কযুক্ত। দুই দেশের সভ্যতা, সংস্কৃতি ও আত্মিক যোগ যেমন অনন্তকালের, তেমনই আধুনিক পৃথিবীতে ভূকৌশলগত যোগাযোগও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। এই কারণে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্র নিয়ে ভারত কখনো উদাসীন থাকেনি। থাকতে পারেও না। তবে এই মুহূর্তে সবকিছু ছাপিয়ে বড় হয়ে উঠেছে আর্থিক সংকট। স্মৃতি বলেন, ২০ জুলাই শ্রীলঙ্কার নতুন প্রেসিডেন্ট নির্বাচন। রনিল বিক্রমাসিংহে প্রেসিডেন্ট পদে প্রার্থী হবেন জানিয়েছেন। যিনিই নির্বাচিত হোন, তাঁর প্রথম কাজ হবে আর্থিক সংকট থেকে দেশকে বের করে আনা। বাকি সব পরের কথা। এই সংকট চীনের পক্ষে আদৌ সুখকর নয়। কারণ, তাদের পাতা ঋণের ফাঁদে পড়ায় চীনা সম্প্রসারণবাদ সম্পর্কে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্রের জনগণের মনে বিরূপ ধারণার জন্ম হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতি ভারতের পক্ষে কিছুটা স্বস্তিজনক বলে সাউথ ব্লক মনে করছে। এই মনোভাব আগামী দিনে ভারত কীভাবে কাজে লাগাবে, সেটা পরের কথা। আপাতত ভারত তাকিয়ে রয়েছে নতুন সরকার ঋণের মোকাবিলা কীভাবে করে। শ্রীলঙ্কা বিশেষজ্ঞ অধ্যাপক এস ডি মুনি এই প্রসঙ্গে শনিবার প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, রনিল বিক্রমাসিংহে প্রেসিডেন্ট হলে ভারত খুশি হবে। ভারতের সঙ্গে তাঁর সম্পর্ক বহুদিনের। কিন্তু তাঁকে অর্থনৈতিক সংস্কার ও জনগণের সুরাহার মধ্যে একটা ভারসাম্য রক্ষা করতে হবে। সেটা তিনি কতটা পারবেন, বলা কঠিন। অধ্যাপক মুনি আরও বলেন, শ্রীলঙ্কার এই আন্দোলন কোনো দলনির্ভর নয়, স্বতঃস্ফূর্ত। কাজেই রনিলকে জনতা আদৌ সমর্থন করবে কি না, করলে কত দিন, সেটাও দেখার। শেষ কথা বলা তো দূরের কথা, এক-দুই মাস পরের অবস্থা কেমন হতে পারে, সেই ভবিষ্যদ্বাণী করাও এই মুহূর্তে কঠিন। তাঁর মতে, ভারতের অপেক্ষা ছাড়া করণীয় আর কিছুই নেই।",

        "body": "ভারতে বাংলাদেশিদের নিরাপত্তা–শঙ্কা থাকায় টি-টুয়েন্টি বিশ্বকাপের ম্যাচ খেলতে সে দেশে দল না পাঠানোর সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছে বাংলাদেশ ক্রিকেট বোর্ড (বিসিবি)। আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেট কাউন্সিল (আইসিসি) সিদ্ধান্ত পুনর্বিবেচনা করতে বললেও বিসিবি নিজেদের সিদ্ধান্তে অনড় রয়েছে। দুই পক্ষের মধ্যে সর্বশেষ যে ভিডিও কনফারেন্স হয়েছে, তাতে বাংলাদেশের আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ বর্তমানে ভারতে কোনো রকম নিরাপত্তা–সংকট ছাড়াই আম্পায়ারিং করছেন বলে আইসিসির বক্তব্যে তুলে ধরা হয়। ভারতের বিভিন্ন গণমাধ্যমেও কয়েক দিন ধরে শরফুদ্দৌলার ভারতের ম্যাচে দায়িত্ব পালন নিয়ে খবর প্রকাশ করেছে। বাংলাদেশি আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ চলমান ভারত-নিউজিল্যান্ড ওয়ানডে সিরিজের আম্পায়ার প্যানেলে আছেন। ১১ জানুয়ারি বড়োদরায় সিরিজের প্রথম ওয়ানডের পর গতকাল রাজকোটে সিরিজের দ্বিতীয় ওয়ানডেতেও তিনি তৃতীয় আম্পায়ারের দায়িত্বে ছিলেন। এমনকি ১৮ জানুয়ারি ইন্দোরে সিরিজের শেষ ওয়ানডেতে তাঁকে অনফিল্ড আম্পায়ার হিসেবেও দেখা যেতে পারে। শরফুদ্দৌলার ভারতে অবস্থান ও ভারতের ম্যাচ পরিচালনায় অংশগ্রহণের কারণে কারও কারও প্রশ্ন—বিসিবি যখন নিরাপত্তা শঙ্কায় দল পাঠাচ্ছে না, তখন শরফুদ্দৌলা কীভাবে ভারতে আম্পায়ারিং করছেন? আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেট সিরিজে আম্পায়ার ও ম্যাচ রেফারি নিযুক্ত করে আইসিসি। প্রতিটি ম্যাচ বা সিরিজে কোন কোন আম্পায়ার দায়িত্ব পালন করবেন, তা নির্ধারণে আইসিসি কিছু মানদণ্ড অনুসরণ করে। আইসিসি ওয়েবসাইটে এ বিষয়ে কিছু ধারণা দেওয়া হয়েছে। যেমন ম্যাচ বা সিরিজে অংশগ্রহণকারী দেশগুলোর প্রভাবমুক্ত বা নিরপেক্ষ থাকা, ওই সময়ে দায়িত্ব পালনের জন্য উন্মুক্ত থাকাদের মধ্যে সেরা অপেক্ষাকৃত ভালো পারফর্ম করা আম্পায়ারদের বেশি সুযোগ দেওয়া, একই দলের ম্যাচে নির্দিষ্ট কোনো আম্পায়ারের বারবার দায়িত্ব পালনের বিষয়টি এড়ানো এবং কাজের চাপের বিষয়ে লক্ষ্য রাখা। বলে রাখা ভালো, আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেটে শুরু থেকে দীর্ঘদিন পর্যন্ত আম্পায়ার নিয়োগ করত আয়োজক দেশের বোর্ড। ১৯৯৩ সালে আইসিসি প্রতিটি টেস্ট ম্যাচে একজন করে নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার দেওয়ার কার্যক্রম শুরু করে। পরে যা ওয়ানডেতেও কার্যকর হয়। নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার হিসেবে নিয়োগ দেওয়ার সুবিধার্থে ক্রিকেটের নিয়ন্ত্রক সংস্থা ২০০২ সালে এলিট প্যানেল গঠন করে। দুই দশকের বেশি সময় ধরে এই এলিট প্যানেল থেকেই দুটি পূর্ণ সদস্যদেশের দ্বিপক্ষীয় সিরিজ ও আইসিসি টুর্নামেন্টের জন্য আম্পায়ার বাছাই করা হয়। তবে এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়ার বেশি নয় বলে বড় টুর্নামেন্টগুলোতে আন্তর্জাতিক প্যানেল থেকেও আম্পায়ার নেওয়া হয়। আম্পায়ারদের মোট চারটি প্যানেল আছে। প্রথমটি হচ্ছে ন্যাশনাল আম্পায়ার, যাঁরা মূলত সংশ্লিষ্ট দেশের ক্রিকেট বোর্ডের অধীন। ঘরোয়া প্রথম শ্রেণির ম্যাচ, লিস্ট ‘এ’ ও টি-টুয়েন্টি পর্যন্ত আম্পায়ারিং করতে পারেন তাঁরা। পরের ধাপে আছে আইসিসি ইন্টারন্যাশনাল আম্পায়ার্স প্যানেল। এই ধাপের আম্পায়াররা ঘরের মাঠে ওয়ানডে ও আন্তর্জাতিক টি-টোয়েন্টি পরিচালনা করতে পারেন। তৃতীয় ধাপকে বলা হয় আইসিসি ইমার্জিং আম্পায়ার প্যানেল, যা মূলত এলিট প্যানেলে যাওয়ার আগে সর্বশেষ ধাপ। আম্পায়ারদের সর্বোচ্চ স্তর হচ্ছে আইসিসি এলিট আম্পায়ার প্যানেল। এই প্যানেলে থাকা আম্পায়াররা নিরপেক্ষ আম্পায়ার হিসেবে টেস্ট ও ওয়ানডে ম্যাচে দায়িত্ব পালন করেন। বর্তমানে এলিট প্যানেলে আম্পায়ার আছেন ১২ জন। তাঁদের মধ্যে বাংলাদেশের একমাত্র আম্পায়ার শরফুদ্দৌলা ইবনে শহীদ। ২০২৪ সালের মার্চ এলিট প্যানেলে অন্তর্ভুক্ত হন তিনি, যা বাংলাদেশের আম্পায়ারদের মধ্যে প্রথম। এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়াররা সরাসরি আইসিসির সঙ্গে চুক্তিবদ্ধ। আইসিসি যখন যেখানে পাঠায়, সেখানেই দায়িত্ব পালন করতে যান। যেমন গত মাসে অস্ট্রেলিয়া-ইংল্যান্ডের অ্যাশেজে ব্রিসবেন টেস্টে মাঠে ছিলেন তিনি। মাঝখানে কয়েক দিন বিপিএলে ম্যাচ পরিচালনা করে এখন গেছেন ভারত-নিউজিল্যান্ড সিরিজে। শরফুদ্দৌলা বিসিবি আয়োজিত টুর্নামেন্টে আম্পায়ারিং করেন। তবে আন্তর্জাতিক ক্রিকেটে আম্পায়ারিংয়ের জন্য তিনি আইসিসির আওতাধীন। এলিট প্যানেলের আম্পায়ার হওয়ায় বিসিবির কাছ থেকে তাঁর ছাড়পত্র নেওয়ার বিষয় নেই। এ বিষয়ে বিসিবি পরিচালক ইফতেখার রহমান পরিষ্কার করেই বলেছেন, ‘তিনি আইসিসির চুক্তিবদ্ধ আম্পায়ার। আমাদের সঙ্গে চুক্তিবদ্ধ নন। আমাদের সঙ্গে যে চুক্তি, সেটা হচ্ছে যখনই তাঁর আইসিসির দায়িত্ব থাকবে, তিনি চলে যাবেন। এখানে অনাপত্তিপত্র দেওয়ার বিষয় নেই। অ্যাগ্রিমেন্টেই আছে, আইসিসির কাজ থাকলে স্বয়ংক্রিয়ভাবে তিনি অবমুক্ত। তাঁকে কোথাও যেতে দেওয়ার অনুমতি দেওয়া বা না দেওয়ার কোনো এখতিয়ার আমাদের নেই।’",

        "body": "Pakistani authorities have announced plans to produce a film titled Mera Lyari, citing what they described as Indian propaganda in the portrayal of Karachi’s Lyari area in the Bollywood film Dhurandhar. The Sindh Information Department said the upcoming film aims to present what it termed an accurate depiction of Lyari, contrasting with how the area was shown in Dhurandhar, which is set partly in Lyari between 1999 and 2009. The Indian film, released on December 5, depicts the area as being affected by gang violence, police operations, drug trafficking and militancy. Although Dhurandhar was not released in Pakistan, it has drawn attention there following its commercial success in India. The film was directed by Aditya Dhar and stars Ranveer Singh. In a post on X, the Sindh Information Department said Lyari represents “culture, peace and resilience” and rejected what it called attempts to portray the area through propaganda. It said Mera Lyari is scheduled for release in January 2026. Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, has historically been associated with gang-related violence, particularly during the early 2000s, a period depicted in Dhurandhar. The film includes characters based on real-life figures linked to criminal activity and law enforcement operations in the area. Officials said the new Pakistani film will focus on Lyari’s social and cultural identity. Further details about the cast and production have not been disclosed.",

        "body": "অপেক্ষা, তীক্ষ্ণ নিরীক্ষণ ও ক্ষোভ প্রশমিত হওয়ার জন্য প্রতীক্ষা ছাড়া শ্রীলঙ্কা পরিস্থিতিতে এই মুহূর্তে ভারতের করার কিছুই নেই। দেশটির ঘটনাপ্রবাহ কোন দিকে গড়ায়, তা না দেখে ভারত আগ বাড়িয়ে এমন কিছুই করতে চায় না, যাতে মনে হতে পারে এই সংকটে তারা কোনো বিশেষ পক্ষকে সঙ্গ দিচ্ছে। ভারত বারবার এটাই বুঝিয়ে দিচ্ছে, সম্পর্কটা দুই দেশের জনগণের মধ্যে এবং এ সংকটে ভারত দৃঢ়ভাবে শ্রীলঙ্কার জনগণের সঙ্গে রয়েছে। পাশাপাশি এটাও বুঝিয়ে দেওয়া হচ্ছে, সংকট থেকে পরিত্রাণের জন্য ভারত ইতিমধ্যেই শ্রীলঙ্কাকে ৩ দশমিক ৮ বিলিয়ন ডলার আর্থিক সহায়তা দিয়েছে। জ্বালানি, খাদ্য, ওষুধ, সার ও অন্যান্য আবশ্যক পণ্য সরবরাহ করেছে। ত্রাণের বিষয়ে শ্রীলঙ্কার সঙ্গে ঘনিষ্ঠ সম্পর্কও রেখে চলছে। ভারতের পররাষ্ট্রমন্ত্রী এস জয়শঙ্করের কথায়, ‘দেশটি সমস্যার মধ্য দিয়ে চলছে। সংকট গভীর। এই অবস্থা হুট করে শুরু হয়নি। কীভাবে তারা এর মোকাবিলা করে, তা দেখতে আমরা অপেক্ষায় আছি।’ ভারতের অপেক্ষা দুটি ক্ষেত্রে। প্রথমটি অবশ্যই অর্থনৈতিক সংকট। জনগণকে কিছুটা সুরাহা দিতে দেশটি কী করে, সেদিকে ভারত আগ্রহ নিয়ে অপেক্ষা করছে। পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের এক সূত্রের মতে, মূল্যস্ফীতি দিন দিন বেড়ে চলেছে। ফলে জনতার ক্ষোভও বাড়ছে। দ্রুত এর সামাল দিতে না পারলে অভ্যন্তরীণ পরিস্থিতি হাতের বাইরে চলে যেতে পারে। তেমন হলে অর্থনৈতিক সংকট অন্য ধরনের জাতিগত সমস্যার জন্ম দিতে পারে। দ্বিতীয় অপেক্ষা রাজনৈতিক। এই বিষয়ে ভারত আরও সতর্ক। সংকটের প্রথম দিকে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্রের কোনো কোনো স্বার্থান্বেষী মহল এমন একটা ধারণা দিতে চেয়েছিল যে ক্ষমতাসীন রাজাপক্ষে পরিবারকে জনরোষ থেকে ভারত বাঁচাতে চাইছে। তাদের দেশত্যাগে মদদ দিচ্ছে। পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের সূত্রটির কথায়, দ্রুত ওই ধারণা নস্যাৎ করা সম্ভব হয়েছে। সে দেশের হাইকমিশন থেকে বিবৃতি দিয়ে বলা হয়েছে, এ-সংক্রান্ত প্রচার একেবারেই মনগড়া, ভিত্তিহীন ও অনুমাননির্ভর। স্পষ্ট করে ভারত তখন থেকেই জানিয়ে আসছে, সরকার নয়, ভারত দৃঢ়ভাবে রয়েছে শ্রীলঙ্কার জনগণের সঙ্গে। গণতন্ত্রের সঙ্গে। ভারতের অবস্থান সে দেশের সংবিধানের পক্ষে। শ্রীলঙ্কার সমৃদ্ধি ও উন্নতিই ভারতের কাম্য। বিদায়ী সরকার অথবা কোনো রাজনৈতিক দলের পক্ষই যে ভারত নিচ্ছে না, বারবার সে কথা মনে করিয়ে দেওয়ার মধ্য দিয়ে এটা স্পষ্ট যে ওই দেশের রাজনৈতিক পটপরিবর্তনের চরিত্র কী হতে চলেছে, সে বিষয়ে কোনো ধারণা ভারতীয় নেতৃত্বের এখনো নেই। পাশাপাশি জনগণের সঙ্গে থাকার কথা মনে করিয়ে দেওয়ার মধ্য দিয়ে বোঝানো হচ্ছে, বিপদের সময় প্রতিবেশীর পাশে দৃঢ়ভাবে দাঁড়াতে ভারত বদ্ধপরিকর। এ-ও বোঝাচ্ছে, পরিবর্তন যা-ই হোক, তা যেন গণতান্ত্রিক উপায়ে শান্তিপূর্ণভাবে হয়। ভারতের পররাষ্ট্র মন্ত্রণালয়ের পক্ষ থেকে বারবার বলা হচ্ছে, ওই দেশে সামরিক হস্তক্ষেপের কোনো প্রশ্নই ওঠে না। রাজনৈতিক ও অর্থনৈতিক ডামাডোল শুরু হওয়ার সময় উদ্বাস্তু-সংক্রান্ত একটা শঙ্কা ভারতের মনে উঁকি দিয়েছিল। কিন্তু সম্প্রতি সেই আশঙ্কা থেকেও ভারত মুক্ত। ভারতের ইনস্টিটিউট ফর ডিফেন্স স্টাডিজ অ্যান্ড অ্যানালাইসিসের (আইডিএসএ) গবেষক স্মৃতি পট্টনায়ক গতকাল শনিবার প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, এটা ঠিক যে শ্রীলঙ্কার নিরাপত্তা, অর্থনৈতিক প্রবৃদ্ধি ও স্থিতিশীলতার সঙ্গে ভারতের স্বার্থ ঘনিষ্ঠ সম্পর্কযুক্ত। দুই দেশের সভ্যতা, সংস্কৃতি ও আত্মিক যোগ যেমন অনন্তকালের, তেমনই আধুনিক পৃথিবীতে ভূকৌশলগত যোগাযোগও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ। এই কারণে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্র নিয়ে ভারত কখনো উদাসীন থাকেনি। থাকতে পারেও না। তবে এই মুহূর্তে সবকিছু ছাপিয়ে বড় হয়ে উঠেছে আর্থিক সংকট। স্মৃতি বলেন, ২০ জুলাই শ্রীলঙ্কার নতুন প্রেসিডেন্ট নির্বাচন। রনিল বিক্রমাসিংহে প্রেসিডেন্ট পদে প্রার্থী হবেন জানিয়েছেন। যিনিই নির্বাচিত হোন, তাঁর প্রথম কাজ হবে আর্থিক সংকট থেকে দেশকে বের করে আনা। বাকি সব পরের কথা। এই সংকট চীনের পক্ষে আদৌ সুখকর নয়। কারণ, তাদের পাতা ঋণের ফাঁদে পড়ায় চীনা সম্প্রসারণবাদ সম্পর্কে দ্বীপরাষ্ট্রের জনগণের মনে বিরূপ ধারণার জন্ম হয়েছে। এই পরিস্থিতি ভারতের পক্ষে কিছুটা স্বস্তিজনক বলে সাউথ ব্লক মনে করছে। এই মনোভাব আগামী দিনে ভারত কীভাবে কাজে লাগাবে, সেটা পরের কথা। আপাতত ভারত তাকিয়ে রয়েছে নতুন সরকার ঋণের মোকাবিলা কীভাবে করে। শ্রীলঙ্কা বিশেষজ্ঞ অধ্যাপক এস ডি মুনি এই প্রসঙ্গে শনিবার প্রথম আলোকে বলেন, রনিল বিক্রমাসিংহে প্রেসিডেন্ট হলে ভারত খুশি হবে। ভারতের সঙ্গে তাঁর সম্পর্ক বহুদিনের। কিন্তু তাঁকে অর্থনৈতিক সংস্কার ও জনগণের সুরাহার মধ্যে একটা ভারসাম্য রক্ষা করতে হবে। সেটা তিনি কতটা পারবেন, বলা কঠিন। অধ্যাপক মুনি আরও বলেন, শ্রীলঙ্কার এই আন্দোলন কোনো দলনির্ভর নয়, স্বতঃস্ফূর্ত। কাজেই রনিলকে জনতা আদৌ সমর্থন করবে কি না, করলে কত দিন, সেটাও দেখার। শেষ কথা বলা তো দূরের কথা, এক-দুই মাস পরের অবস্থা কেমন হতে পারে, সেই ভবিষ্যদ্বাণী করাও এই মুহূর্তে কঠিন। তাঁর মতে, ভারতের অপেক্ষা ছাড়া করণীয় আর কিছুই নেই।",

বিশেষ করে বিহারে জেডিইউয়ের সঙ্গে বিজেপিও যখন ক্ষমতায়? গতকাল মঙ্গলবার দিনভর ভারত-যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের মধ্যে বন্ধ থাকা বাণিজ্য আলোচনা চলেছে। আলোচনায় অংশ নিতে দিল্লি এসেছিলেন মার্কিন সহকারী বাণিজ্য প্রতিনিধি ব্রেন্ডন লিঞ্চ। তাঁর সঙ্গে আলোচনায় ভারতের প্রতিনিধিদলের নেতৃত্ব দিয়েছিলেন শিল্প মন্ত্রণালয়ের বিশেষ সচিব রাজেশ আগারওয়াল। আলোচনার পর দুই দেশই বিবৃতি দিয়ে জানিয়েছে, কথাবার্তা হয়েছে খুবই ইতিবাচক। দুই দেশই চাইছে উভয়ের লাভের দিকে তাকিয়ে ভবিষ্যতের উপযুক্ত চুক্তি করতে। দুই দেশই আপাতত পরবর্তী পদক্ষেপের দিকে তাকিয়ে। বিবৃতিতে বলা কথাগুলো শুনতে ভালো হলেও এই বাণিজ্য আলোচনা সেই দশ হাতি শাড়ির মতো, যা দিয়ে মাথা ও পেছন দুই অঙ্গ ঢাকা দেওয়া যায় না। একটা ঢাকতে গেলে অন্যটা উন্মুক্ত হয়। ভারতের পক্ষে মার্কিন প্রস্তাব তাই ‘দো ধারি তরোয়ালের’ মতো। মেনে নিলে ঘরে বিপদের মুখোমুখি হতে হবে, না মানলে করতে হবে বাইরের বিপদের মোকাবিলা। কী করবেন নরেন্দ্র মোদি? এই পরিস্থিতিতে লড়াইটা এখন হচ্ছে ভুট্টা নিয়ে। এটা এখন আর গোপন নয় যে ডোনাল্ড ট্রাম্প চাইছেন ভারতের কৃষি ও দুগ্ধজাত শিল্প তাঁদের জন্য উন্মুক্ত করা হোক। মোদি তা হতে দিতে চান না। কৃষিক্ষেত্রে মার্কিন রপ্তানি মেনে নিলে দেশের ৭০ কোটি কৃষিজীবীর রোষে গদি উল্টে যাবে। তা যে তিনি হতে দেবেন না, লালকেল্লা থেকে দেওয়া ভাষণে স্পষ্ট করে দিয়েছেন। ভুট্টা ওই কৃষিক্ষেত্রেরই একটা অঙ্গ। যুক্তরাষ্ট্র চাইছে, মার্কিন মুলুকে উৎপাদিত ভুট্টার কিছুটা অন্তত ভারতে রপ্তানি করার অনুমতি মোদি সরকার দিক। ট্রাম্পের বাণিজ্যমন্ত্রী হাওয়ার্ড লুটনিক কটাক্ষ করে বলেছেন, ‘ভারত ১৪০ কোটি মানুষের দেশ বলে বড়াই করে বেড়ায় অথচ আমাদের কাছ থেকে এক বুশেল (ব্যারেলের মতো আরেক পরিমাপ, এক বুশেল প্রায় সাড়ে ২৪ কেজি) ভুট্টা কিনতে পারে না? ওরা আমাদের কাছে সব বেচবে, অথচ সামান্য ভুট্টাও কিনবে না!’ বোঝাই যাচ্ছে, এই মুহূর্তে ট্রাম্প প্রশাসনের তালিকার ১ নম্বরে রয়েছে ভুট্টা। ভুট্টা নিয়ে প্রেসিডেন্ট ট্রাম্পের মাথাব্যথার যথেষ্ট কারণও আছে। পৃথিবীতে সবচেয়ে বেশি ভুট্টা উৎপাদিত হয় যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে। ২০২৪-২৫ সালে তারা উৎপাদন করেছে প্রায় ৩৭ কোটি ৮০ লাখ টন। এর মধ্যে রপ্তানি করেছে প্রায় ৭ কোটি ২০ লাখ টন। ২০২৫-২৬ সালে তাদের উৎপাদনের লক্ষ্যমাত্রা নির্ধারিত হয়েছে ৪২ কোটি ৭০ লাখ টন। রপ্তানির লক্ষ্যমাত্রা ৭ কোটি ৫০ লাখ টন। এ অবস্থায় গোল বাধিয়েছে ট্রাম্পের বাণিজ্য শুল্কনীতি। তাতে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের ভুট্টাচাষিদের মাথায় বজ্রাঘাত। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের ভুট্টাচাষিরা চীন বেঁকে বসেছে বলে চিন্তায় পড়েছেন। শুল্কনীতি নিয়ে রেষারেষির ফলে যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে ভুট্টা আমদানি চীন কমিয়ে দিয়েছে। ২০২২ সালে যুক্তরাষ্ট্র ভুট্টা রপ্তানি করেছিল ১ হাজার ৮৫০ কোটি ডলারের। এর মধ্যে শুধু চীনে রপ্তানি হয়েছিল ৫২৫ কোটি ডলারের ভুট্টা। বাকি আমদানিকারকদের মধ্যে ছিল মেক্সিকো, জাপান, কানাডা ও কলম্বিয়া। তুলনায় ২০২৪-২৫ অর্থবছরে ভারত ভুট্টা আমদানি করেছিল ১০ লাখ টনের কম। তার অর্ধেক এসেছিল মিয়ানমার থেকে, বাকিটা ছিল ইউক্রেন থেকে। যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে ওই বছর ভারত ভুট্টা কিনেছিল মাত্র ১ হাজার ১০০ টন। গত বছর থেকেই যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে ভুট্টা আমদানি চীন কমিয়ে দেয়। ২০২২ সালে যেখানে চীন আমদানি করেছিল ৫২৫ কোটি ডলারে, ২০২৪ সালে তা কমে দাঁড়ায় মাত্র ৩৩ কোটি ১০ লাখ ডলারে। ওই বছর ভুট্টা রপ্তানি থেকে যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের আয়ও কমে যায় প্রায় ৫০০ কোটি ডলার। চলতি বছর যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের সঙ্গে বাণিজ্য রেষারেষি শুরু হওয়ায় চীন ভুট্টা আমদানি আরও কমানোর সিদ্ধান্ত নিয়েছে। ঠিক করেছে, যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে তারা স্রেফ ২৪০ কোটি ডলারের ভুট্টা আমদানি করবে। এই সিদ্ধান্তে মাথায় হাত পড়েছে ট্রাম্পের। ট্রাম্পের মাথায় হাত পড়ার কারণও আছে। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের ভুট্টা উৎপাদনকারী রাজ্যগুলো হলো—আইওয়া, নেব্রাস্কা, ইলিনয়, মিনেসোটা, ইন্ডিয়ানা, উত্তর ও দক্ষিণ ডাকোটা, কানসাস, মিজৌরি, ওহায়ো ও উইসকনসিন। এসব রাজ্যের অধিকাংশ রিপাবলিকান ট্রাম্পের সমর্থক। গত নির্বাচনে তাদের অধিকাংশই ট্রাম্পকে ঢালাও ভোট দিয়েছিলেন। ভুট্টা বেচা না গেলে ট্রাম্পের সমর্থনেও ভাটা পড়বে। মাথায় হাত পড়ায় ট্রাম্প এখন চেয়ে আছেন ভারতের দিকে। তাঁর চোখে চীনের বিকল্প দেশ একটাই। ভারত। তিনি ভাবছেন, ভারতই হতে পারে তাঁর মুশকিল আসান। কিন্তু বিপদ ভারতেরও। ভুট্টা আমদানির সিদ্ধান্ত পথে বসাতে পারে নরেন্দ্র মোদির দল ও সরকারকে। ভারতের বর্তমান নীতি অনুযায়ী, এখনো পর্যন্ত পাঁচ লাখ টন পর্যন্ত ভুট্টা আমদানির ওপর শুল্ক ধার্য রয়েছে ১৫ শতাংশ। তার বেশি হলে শুল্কের পরিমাণ বেড়ে হয় ৫০ শতাংশ। দ্বিতীয়ত, জিনগতভাবে পরিবর্তিত বা জেনেটিক্যালি মডিফায়েড (জিএম) ভুট্টা আমদানি ভারতে নিষিদ্ধ। যুক্তরাষ্ট্রে যে ভুট্টা উৎপাদিত হয়, তার ৯৪ শতাংশ জেনেটিক্যালি মডিফায়েড। ওই ভুট্টা ভারতবাসীর খাওয়ার জন্য তো নয়ই, পশুখাদ্য হিসেবেও আমদানি নিষিদ্ধ। জিএম ভুট্টা চাষও এ দেশে নিষিদ্ধ। ভুট্টা মানুষ ও পশু—উভয়েরই খাদ্য হিসেবে স্বীকৃত। কিন্তু ভারতে জিএম ভুট্টা ওই দুই ক্ষেত্রেও নিষিদ্ধ। ভুট্টা যদিও অন্যভাবে ব্যবহৃত হয়। ভুট্টা থেকে ইথানল তৈরি করা যায়, যা জৈব জ্বালানির বিকল্প। ভারতে সম্প্রতি পেট্রল-ডিজেলে ২০ শতাংশ ইথানল মেশানো হচ্ছে। এতে দূষণের মাত্রা কমছে। সেই ইথানল ভারতে তৈরি হচ্ছে মূলত আখ থেকে। ভারতের বিস্তীর্ণ এলাকায় আখ চাষ হয়। পেট্রলে ২০ শতাংশ ইথানল মেশানো বাধ্যতামূলক হওয়ায় আখচাষিরা উপকৃত হচ্ছেন। ভারতের রাজনীতিতে উত্তর প্রদেশ, মহারাষ্ট্র, হরিয়ানা ও পাঞ্জাবে আখচাষি, চিনি মিল বা ‘সুগার লবি’র প্রভূত প্রভাব রয়েছে। এই মহল চায় না মার্কিন মুলুকের ভুট্টা আমদানি করে তা ইথানল তৈরিতে ব্যবহৃত হোক। যেমন বিহার, মধ্যপ্রদেশ ও কর্নাটক চায় না ভুট্টা চাষে তাদের যা দখল, তা যুক্তরাষ্ট্র থেকে আমদানি করা ভুট্টা হাতিয়ে নিক। না চাওয়ার কারণও আছে। সারা পৃথিবীতেই যুক্তরাষ্ট্রের উৎপাদিত জিএম ভুট্টার দাম সবচেয়ে কম। ভারতে প্রস্তুত ভুট্টার গড় দাম যেখানে প্রতি কেজি ২২-২৩ রুপি, মার্কিন জিএম ভুট্টার দাম সেখানে মাত্র ১৫ রুপি। শুধু ইথানল প্রস্তুতের জন্য মার্কিন মুলুকের জিএম ভুট্টা আমদানি করা যায়। কিন্তু ভারতের নীতি আয়োগ এখনো পর্যন্ত সেই অনুমতি দেয়নি। নীতি আয়োগের সিদ্ধান্তের চেয়েও গুরুত্বপূর্ণ, সিদ্ধান্তটি হতে হবে রাজনৈতিক। বাণিজ্য চুক্তি নিয়ে আলোচনা অব্যাহত রয়েছে ঠিকই, কিন্তু জট অত সহজে খোলার নয়। একদিকে রয়েছে দেশের রপ্তানিকারকদের স্বার্থ, ৫০ শতাংশ শুল্কের ধাক্কায় যাঁদের নাভিশ্বাস ওঠার জোগাড়; অন্যদিকে রয়েছে গ্রামীণ ভারতের জীবিকার প্রশ্ন ও তাকে ঘিরে তীব্র রাজনৈতিক চাপ। এই পরিস্থিতিতে শ্যাম না কুল—কোনটা রাখবেন প্রধানমন্ত্রী নরেন্দ্র মোদি?",
